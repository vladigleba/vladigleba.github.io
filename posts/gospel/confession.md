## Is God willing to forgive?

> Who is a God like unto thee, that *pardoneth* iniquity, and *passeth by* the transgression of the remnant of his heritage? He retaineth not his anger for ever, because he *delighteth in mercy*. He will turn again, he will *have compassion* upon us; he will *subdue* our iniquities; and thou wilt *cast all their sins into the depths of the sea*. 
{% ct 'Micah 7:18-19' %}

> For I will be *merciful to their unrighteousness*, and their sins and their iniquities will I remember no more. 
{% ct 'Hebrews 8:12' %}

## Did God forsake Israel in their rebellion?

> And refused to obey, neither were mindful of thy wonders that thou didst among them; but hardened their necks, and in their rebellion appointed a captain to return to their bondage: but thou art a God *ready to pardon, gracious and merciful, slow to anger, and of great kindness, and forsookest them not*. 
{% ct 'Nehemiah 9:17' %}

## How can I receive forgiveness of my sins?

> *Repent* ye therefore, and *be converted*, that your sins may be blotted out, when the times of refreshing shall come from the presence of the Lord. 
{% ct 'Acts 3:19' %}

> Let the wicked *forsake his way*, and the unrighteous man his thoughts: and let him return unto the LORD, and he will have mercy upon him; and to our God, for he will abundantly pardon. 
{% ct 'Isaiah 55:7' %}

Forsaking my way implies turning around and going in the opposite direction. I go from running away from God toward sin to running away from sin toward God. If I repent and have a desire to leave my sins behind, the promise is I will receive forgiveness.

## How many sins is God willing to cleanse me from?

> If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us *from all unrighteousness*. 
{% ct '1 John 1:9' %}

God will never refuse to forgive a person who is truly sorry and genuinely asks Him for forgiveness.

## How does God want me to live after I’ve been forgiven?

> When Jesus had lifted up himself, and saw none but the woman, he said unto her, Woman, where are those thine accusers? hath no man condemned thee? She said, No man, Lord. And Jesus said unto her, Neither do I condemn thee: *go, and sin no more*. 
{% ct 'John 8:10-11' %}

Jesus doesn’t just want to forgive my sins; He wants to cleanse me from my sins and restore His image in me by transforming my life.

## How can He give me victory over all of my sins?

> *Ask, and it shall be given you*; seek, and ye shall find; knock, and it shall be opened unto you: *for every one that asketh receiveth*; and he that seeketh findeth; and to him that knocketh it shall be opened. 
{% ct 'Matthew 7:7-8' %}

> And this is the confidence that we have in him, that, *if we ask any thing according to his will, he heareth us*. 
{% ct '1 John 5:14' %}

> What shall we then say to these things? *If God be for us, who can be against us*? He that spared not His own Son, but delivered Him up for us all, *how shall He not with Him also freely give us all things*? 
{% ct 'Romans 8:31-32' %}

There is no sin too powerful for God, but He cannot do anything against my will either. If I confess my sins and ask Him to give me victory over them, believing that He is powerful enough to do it, He will do it according to my faith.

## What promise does He give me?

> Then will I sprinkle clean water upon you, and ye shall be clean: *from all your filthiness, and from all your idols, will I cleanse you. A new heart also will I give you, and a new spirit will I put within you*: and I will take away the stony heart out of your flesh, and I will give you an heart of flesh. And *I will put my spirit within you, and cause you to walk in my statutes, and ye shall keep my judgments, and do them*. 
{% ct 'Ezekiel 36:25-27' %}

> He will turn again, he will have compassion upon us; he will *subdue our iniquities*; and thou wilt *cast all their sins* into the depths of the sea. 
{% ct 'Micah 7:19' %}

God wants to free me from the power of sin because sin hurts me. He can also give me the power to be free because I cannot change myself, just like a leopard cannot change his spots, but He can! He promises to give a new heart and a new spirit to those who ask Him.

## Why can I receive forgiveness?

> I have blotted out, as a thick cloud, thy transgressions, and, as a cloud, thy sins: return unto me; *for I have redeemed thee*. 
{% ct 'Isaiah 44:22' %}

## Who ended up paying for my sins?

>   Who hath delivered us from the power of darkness, and hath translated us into the kingdom of his dear Son: *in whom we have redemption through his blood*, even the forgiveness of sins. 
{% ct 'Colossians 1:13-14' %}

I can be forgiven because Christ already paid for my sins on the cross and redeemed me from them. All I have to do is ask.

## Will He remember my sins once I ask for forgiveness?

> I, even I, am he that blotteth out thy transgressions for mine own sake, and *will not remember thy sins*. 
{% ct 'Isaiah 43:25' %}

## What does the Bible say about those who’ve been forgiven?

> *Blessed is he* whose transgression is forgiven, whose sin is covered. 
{% ct 'Psalm 32:1' %}

## Could receiving forgiveness affect my health?

> Bless the LORD, O my soul, and forget not all his benefits: *who forgiveth all thine iniquities; who healeth all thy diseases*; who redeemeth thy life from destruction; who crowneth thee with lovingkindness and tender mercies; who satisfieth thy mouth with good things; so that thy youth is renewed like the eagle’s. 
{% ct 'Psalm 103:2-5' %}

Carrying feelings of guilt is not good for my health, but knowing I’ve been forgiven can bring both physical and mental healing.

## But what if I’ve committed many sins?

> This is a faithful saying, and worthy of all acceptation, that Christ Jesus came into the world *to save sinners; of whom I am chief*. 
{% ct '1 Timothy 1:15' %}

> Wherefore I say unto thee, *her sins, which are many, are forgiven*, for she loved much: but to whom little is forgiven, the same loveth little. 
{% ct 'Luke 7:47' %}

Every sin which I genuinely repent of and confess to Christ wil be forgiven.

## Does God want me to forgive others once He has forgiven me?

> And *be ye kind* one to another, *tenderhearted, forgiving one another*, even as God for Christ’s sake hath forgiven you. 
{% ct 'Ephesians 4:32' %}

> Now instead, you ought to *forgive and comfort* him, so that he will not be overwhelmed by excessive sorrow. I urge you, therefore, to *reaffirm your love* for him. Another reason I wrote you was to see if you would stand the test and be obedient in everything. 
{% ct '2 Corinthians 2:7-9, NIV' %}

Forgiving others and giving the matter over to Jesus also lightens my own burden.
