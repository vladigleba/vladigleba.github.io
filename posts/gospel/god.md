## Does God have a beginning or end?

> Before the mountains were brought forth, or ever thou hadst formed the earth and the world, even *from everlasting to everlasting*, thou art God.
{% ct 'Psalm 90:2' %}

> I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the ending, saith the LORD, *which is, and which was, and which is to come*, the Almighty.
{% ct 'Revelation 1:8' %}

It may be hard for our finite minds to comprehend, but God is infinite; He always has been and always will be.

## Will His name ever cease to be blessed?

> Daniel answered and said, Blessed be the name of God *for ever and ever*: for wisdom and might are his.
{% ct 'Daniel 2:20' %}

## Who is the source of all true wisdom?

> And he changeth the times and the seasons: he removeth kings, and setteth up kings: *he giveth wisdom* unto the wise, and *knowledge* to them that know understanding.
{% ct 'Daniel 2:21' %}

> If any of you lacks wisdom, let him ask of God, *who gives to all liberally* and without reproach, and it will be given to him.
{% ct 'James 1:5, NKJV' %}

## Does God know the future?

> Remember the former things of old: for I am God, and there is none else; I am God, and there is none like me, *declaring the end from the beginning*, and from ancient times the things that are not yet done, saying, My counsel shall stand, and I will do all my pleasure.
{% ct 'Isaiah 46:9, 10' %}

> My frame was not hidden from You, when I was made in secret, and skillfully wrought in the lowest parts of the earth. Your eyes saw my substance, being yet unformed. And *in Your book they all were written, the days fashioned for me, when as yet there were none of them*.
{% ct 'Psalm 139:15, 16, NKJV' %}

> Surely the Lord GOD will do nothing, but *he revealeth his secret unto his servants the prophets*.
{% ct 'Amos 3:7' %}

Not only does God know the future, but He also likes to reveal it ahead of time to strengthen our faith in Him and prepare us for what is to come (see [“Europe’s Future Revealed”](/posts/prophecy/europe.md)).

## Are there any other gods?

> Tell ye, and bring them near; yea, let them take counsel together: who hath declared this from ancient time? who hath told it from that time? have not I the LORD? and *there is no God else beside me*; a just God and a Saviour; there is none beside me.
{% ct 'Isaiah 45:21' %}

> Remember the former things of old: for *I am God, and there is none else; I am God, and there is none like me*.
{% ct 'Isaiah 46:9' %}

> “*To whom will you compare me? Or who is my equal*?” says the Holy One. Lift up your eyes and look to the heavens: Who created all these? He who brings out the starry host one by one and calls forth each of them by name. Because of his great power and mighty strength, not one of them is missing.
{% ct 'Isaiah 40:25, 26, NIV' %}

Satan wants to be like God, but he too is a created being (see [“Origin of Evil”](/posts/gospel/evil.md)).

## How did God create the universe?

> *By the word of the LORD* were the heavens made; and all the host of them *by the breath of his mouth*. He gathereth the waters of the sea together as an heap: he layeth up the depth in storehouses. Let all the earth fear the LORD: let all the inhabitants of the world stand in awe of him. For he spake, and it was done; he commanded, and it stood fast.
{% ct 'Psalm 33:6-9' %}

> And he arose, and rebuked the wind, and *said unto the sea, Peace, be still. And the wind ceased*, and there was a great calm.
{% ct 'Mark 4:39' %}

All God has to do is speak and atoms are immediately created in obedience to His word! And after its been created, all of nature is just as eager to obey her Maker.

## Do the galaxies have anything to say about Him?

> The *heavens declare the glory of God*; the *skies proclaim the work of his hands*. Day after day they pour forth speech; night after night they reveal knowledge.
{% ct 'Psalm 19:1, 2, NIV' %}

## What is God like?

> And the LORD passed by before him, and proclaimed, The LORD, The LORD God, *merciful and gracious, longsuffering, and abundant in goodness and truth, keeping mercy for thousands, forgiving iniquity and transgression and sin, and that will by no means clear the guilty*; visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children, and upon the children's children, unto the third and to the fourth generation.
{% ct 'Exodus 34:6, 7' %}

## What does the psalmist say belongs to God?

> The *earth* is the LORD'S, and the fulness thereof; the world, and *they that dwell therein*.
{% ct 'Psalm 24:1' %}

Everything and everyone created belongs to the Creator first and foremost.

## How does He feel about me?

> The LORD hath appeared of old unto me, saying, Yea, *I have loved thee with an everlasting love*: therefore with lovingkindness have I drawn thee.
{% ct 'Jeremiah 31:3' %}

## Am I ever alone?

> Fear thou not; for *I am with thee*: be not dismayed; for I am thy God: *I will strengthen thee; yea, I will help thee; yea, I will uphold thee* with the right hand of my righteousness.
{% ct 'Isaiah 41:10' %}

> But now thus saith the LORD that created thee, O Jacob, and he that formed thee, O Israel, *Fear not: for I have redeemed thee, I have called thee by thy name; thou art mine*. When thou passest through the waters, *I will be with thee*; and through the rivers, they shall not overflow thee: when thou walkest through the fire, thou shalt not be burned; neither shall the flame kindle upon thee. *For I am the LORD thy God, the Holy One of Israel, thy Saviour*.
{% ct 'Isaiah 43:1-3' %}

The fact that the Creator and King of the universe cares about you personally is astounding and may be hard to believe because we live in a world where love does not reign supreme like it does in heaven, but it is absolutely true!

## How faithful is God?

> Let your conversation be without covetousness; and be content with such things as ye have: for he hath said, *I will never leave thee, nor forsake thee*.
{% ct 'Hebrews 13:5' %}

> Can a woman forget her sucking child, that she should not have compassion on the son of her womb? yea, they may forget, *yet will I not forget thee*. Behold, I have graven thee upon the palms of my hands.
{% ct 'Isaiah 49:15, 16' %}

> That Christ may dwell in your hearts by faith; that ye, being rooted and grounded in love, may be able to comprehend with all saints what is the breadth, and length, and depth, and height; and to *know the love of Christ, which passeth knowledge*, that ye might be filled with all the fulness of God.
{% ct 'Ephesians 3:17-19' %}

It’s said that the bond between mother and child is the strongest human bond there is, but God’s love for you is actually even stronger. It knows no bounds.

## What is the psalmist’s response to Him?

> *I will bless the LORD at all times*: his praise shall continually be in my mouth. My soul shall make her boast in the LORD: the humble shall hear thereof, and be glad. O *magnify the LORD with me, and let us exalt his name together*. I sought the LORD, and he heard me, and delivered me from all my fears.
{% ct 'Psalm 34:1-4' %}
