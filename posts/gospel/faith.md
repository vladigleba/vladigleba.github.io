## What is faith?

> Now faith is the *substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen*.
{% ct 'Hebrews 11:1' %}

Faith is what reaches out and grasps things not seen that are backed up by evidence. In {% rf 'Isaiah 1:18' false %} God says, “Come now, and let us reason together,” which means He does not want anyone to blindly follow Him; on the contrary, He wants faith to be informed by evidence.

## Why is faith necessary?

> But without faith it is impossible to please him: for *he that cometh to God must believe that he is*, and *that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him*.
{% ct 'Hebrews 11:6' %}

Faith is the means by which my journey with Jesus starts. It is the hand of faith that reaches out to grasp the outstretched hand of God. He is always ready and eager to help those who come to Him, but I must first believe in Him and His goodness. This faith is based on plentiful evidence, but the evidence does not remove the need for faith altogether. There will always be room for doubt for those who want to doubt simply because the finite human mind cannot fully grasp an everlasting, infinite God. Thus the need for faith: God said it&mdash;I believe it.

## How many have faith?

> For I say, through the grace given unto me, to every man that is among you, not to think of himself more highly than he ought to think; but to think soberly, according as *God hath dealt to every man the measure of faith*.
{% ct 'Romans 12:3' %}

Fatih is like a muscle; every person has been given a measure of it. Some neglect it, never use it, and it grows weak. Others act on what they have, reaching out to God, and He meets them where they are, revealing Himself to them, which in turn makes their faith stronger, and then they act on that, and it continues to grow each time it is used.

## What if my faith is weak?

> And the apostles said unto the Lord, *Increase our faith*.
{% ct 'Luke 17:5' %}

> Jesus said unto him, If thou canst believe, all things are possible to him that believeth. And straightway the father of the child cried out, and said with tears, *Lord, I believe; help thou mine unbelief*.
{% ct 'Mark 9:23, 24' %}

> Then came the disciples to Jesus apart, and said, Why could not we cast him out? And Jesus said unto them, Because of your unbelief: for verily I say unto you, *If ye have faith as a grain of mustard seed*, ye shall say unto this mountain, Remove hence to yonder place; and it shall remove; and nothing shall be impossible unto you.
{% ct 'Matthew 17:19, 20' %}

Even if my faith is weak and small as a tiny seed, I can exercise the faith that I do have, and ask God to increase it, believing in His power to do so, and it will be done.

## What is faith based on?

> So then faith cometh by hearing, and hearing *by the word of God*.
{% ct 'Romans 10:17' %}

> Another parable put he forth unto them, saying, The kingdom of heaven is *like to a grain of mustard seed*, which a man took, and sowed in his field: which indeed is the least of all seeds: but *when it is grown, it is the greatest among herbs, and becometh a tree*, so that the birds of the air come and lodge in the branches thereof.
{% ct 'Matthew 13:31, 32' %}

Faith is primarily based on the evidence of truth revealed in the Word of God, the Bible. Like a seed that is watered by the rain, faith grows whenever it is watered with the truth of His Word and that truth is then internalized&mdash;received and allowed to take root in the heart. With my cooperation, God can take the small seed of faith and make it grow into a tall tree.

## What role does faith have in prayer?

> And Jesus answering saith unto them, Have faith in God. For verily I say unto you, That whosoever shall say unto this mountain, Be thou removed, and be thou cast into the sea; and shall not doubt in his heart, but shall believe that those things which he saith shall come to pass; he shall have whatsoever he saith. Therefore I say unto you, What things soever ye desire, *when ye pray, believe that ye receive them, and ye shall have them*.
{% ct 'Mark 11:22-24' %}

> And when he was come into the house, the blind men came to him: and Jesus saith unto them, Believe ye that I am able to do this? They said unto him, Yea, Lord. Then touched he their eyes, saying, *According to your faith be it unto you*. And their eyes were opened.
{% ct 'Matthew 9:28-30' %}

> And this is the confidence that we have in him, that, *if we ask any thing according to his will, he heareth us*.
{% ct '1 John 5:14' %}

> But *let him ask in faith, with no doubting*, for he who doubts is like a wave of the sea driven and tossed by the wind.
{% ct 'James 1:6, NKJV' %}

My prayers are answered according to my faith, or confidence, in Jesus’ power and love, which I become aware of by exposing my mind and heart to His Word. The Bible says that I can be confident that any request that is in harmony with God’s will, as revealed in His Word, He hears.

## What is the power of the gospel dependent on?

> For unto us was the gospel preached, as well as unto them: but the word preached did not profit them, not *being mixed with faith in them that heard it*.
{% ct 'Hebrews 4:2' %}

The gospel is the good news of God’s desire and power to save humanity from the misery of sin. When the gospel is mingled with faith, it is acted on and received into the mind and heart, starting a marvelous process of transformation in the life of the receiver through the power of God.

## How do I inherit the promises of God?

> That ye be not slothful, but followers of them who *through faith and patience inherit the promises*.
{% ct 'Hebrews 6:12' %}

> *These all died in faith, not having received the promises, but having seen them afar off, and were persuaded of them, and embraced them*, and confessed that they were strangers and pilgrims on the earth. For they that say such things declare plainly that they seek a country. And truly, if they had been mindful of that country from whence they came out, they might have had opportunity to have returned. But now they desire a better country, that is, an heavenly: wherefore God is not ashamed to be called their God: for he hath prepared for them a city.
{% ct 'Hebrews 11:13-16' %}

## How is faith linked with forgiveness?

> And *when he saw their faith*, he said unto him, Man, *thy sins are forgiven thee*.
{% ct 'Luke 5:20' %}

The Bible shows God is willing to forgive anyone who is truly repentant. When this evidence is acted on by faith, when I take God at His Word, He will forgive me too, just like He forgave the paralytic according to his faith.

## How important is faith in salvation?

> *For by grace are ye saved through faith*; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God: not of works, lest any man should boast.
{% ct 'Ephesians 2:8, 9' %}

Salvation is only through faith. I am made righteous by faith in Jesus’ love as expressed in His willingness to forgive my sins and clothe me with His righteousness. I am also sanctified by faith in His power to save me from my sins. Salvation is completely of God; it is a gift. Faith is the means by which I reach out to Him and recieve that gift.

## Whose faith came to my rescue?

> I am crucified with Christ: nevertheless I live; yet not I, but Christ liveth in me: and the life which I now live in the flesh *I live by the faith of the Son of God*, who loved me, and gave himself for me.
{% ct 'Galatians 2:20' %}

I am alive because of the perfect faith of Jesus, who opened the way of salvation for me.

## What is evident in those who are saved by faith?

> By whom [Jesus] we have received grace and apostleship, *for obedience to the faith* among all nations, for his name.
{% ct 'Romans 1:5' %}

> Here is the patience of the saints: here are they that *keep the commandments of God, and the faith of Jesus*.
{% ct 'Revelation 14:12' %}

Those who have the faith of Jesus also keep the commandments of God because Jesus Himself kept them. In the book of Romans Paul says Jesus gives us grace for obedience to the faith. Now it is true that I am saved by faith alone, but it is also true that once I am saved by Jesus, my love for Him leads me to obey Him. Obedience is the result of salvation, not the means to it. It can only be born out of love for the One who died for me, and it is made possible by His grace working in me.

## Is there more evidence of this?

> Even so *faith, if it hath not works, is dead*, being alone. Yea, a man may say, Thou hast faith, and I have works: shew me thy faith without thy works, and I will shew thee my faith by my works. Thou believest that there is one God; thou doest well: the devils also believe, and tremble. But wilt thou know, O vain man, that *faith without works is dead*?
{% ct 'James 2:17-20' %}

> Do men gather grapes of thorns, or figs of thistles? Even so *every good tree bringeth forth good fruit; but a corrupt tree bringeth forth evil fruit*. ... Wherefore *by their fruits ye shall know them*. Not every one that saith unto me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of heaven; but *he that doeth the will of my Father* which is in heaven. Many will say to me in that day, Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied in thy name? and in thy name have cast out devils? and in thy name done many wonderful works? And then will I profess unto them, I never knew you: depart from me, ye that work iniquity.
{% ct 'Matthew 7:16, 17, 20-23' %}

Obedience shows the genuineness of my faith. Put another way, my faith is confirmed, or justified, to me by my works. They are evidence for me, not God, since He already knows my genuine heart {% rf 'Psalm 139:1-4' %}, but I do need the evidence because it’s easy to deceive myself about my true condition {% rf 'Jeremiah 17:9, 10' %}.

## What is the counterfeit to faith?

> Then the devil taketh him up into the holy city, and setteth him on a pinnacle of the temple, and saith unto him, If thou be the Son of God, cast thyself down: for it is written, He shall give his angels charge concerning thee: and in their hands they shall bear thee up, lest at any time thou dash thy foot against a stone. Jesus said unto him, It is written again, *Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God*.
{% ct 'Matthew 4:5-7' %}

> Behold, *I give unto you power to tread on serpents and scorpions*, and over all the power of the enemy: and nothing shall by any means hurt you.
{% ct 'Luke 10:19' %}

The counterfeit of faith is presumption, which tends to put God to the test under contrived and unnatural circumstances, often for selfish motives. Satan tempted Jesus to cast Himself down to prove His divinity by perverting a promise from {% rf 'Psalm 91:12' false %}, but this promise wasn not made for deliberate, voluntary, self-created dangers. Even though Jesus gave His disciples power over serpents and scorpions, they were not supposed to go looking for them intentionally to prove their faith.

## How do I overcome?

> For whatsoever is born of God overcometh the world: and this is the victory that overcometh the world, *even our faith*.
{% ct '1 John 5:4' %}

Those who have faith in God’s power not only to forgive their sins, but also to save them from their sins will be victorious!
