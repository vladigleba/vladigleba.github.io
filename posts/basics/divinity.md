## What is another name for Jesus? What does it mean?

> Behold, a virgin shall be with child, and shall bring forth a son, and they shall call his name *Emmanuel*, which being interpreted is, *God with us*.
{% ref 'Matthew 1:23' %}

## Does John confirm Jesus’ divinity?

> In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the *Word was God*. &hellip; And the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us, and we beheld his glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father, full of grace and truth.
{% ref 'John 1:1, 14' %}

## What did Jesus say about His divinity?

> And now, O Father, *glorify thou me with thine own self with the glory which I had with thee before the world was*. &hellip; Father, I will that they also, whom thou hast given me, be with me where I am; *that they may behold my glory, which thou hast given me*: for thou lovedst me before the foundation of the world.
{% ref 'John 17:5, 24' %}

The Father shares His glory with His Son, Jesus, and it has always been this way.

## What other claim did Jesus make?

> Jesus said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, *Before Abraham was, I am.*
{% ref 'John 8:58' %}

## Why is this claim significant?

> And *God* said unto Moses, “*I AM THAT I AM*”: and he said, “Thus shalt thou say unto the children of Israel, ‘*I AM hath sent me unto you*.’”
{% ref 'Exodus 3:14' %}

Jesus used this expression to reveal Himself to Moses as “the Self-existing One.” It mirrors another of God’s names, Yahweh, which comes from a Hebrew word meaning “to be” or “to exist.” He’s telling Moses that He has no beginning or end.

## Does Paul corroborate this?

> *For by him were all things created*, that are in heaven, and that are in earth, visible and invisible, whether they be thrones, or dominions, or principalities, or powers: all things were created by him, and for him: and *he is before all things, and by him all things consist*.
{% ref 'Colossians 1:16, 17' %}

Not only is Jesus the Self-existing One, but He is also the Creator of all things!

## What is another sign of Jesus’ divinity?

> And when he saw their faith, he said unto him, Man, *thy sins are forgiven thee*. And the scribes and the Pharisees began to reason, saying, Who is this which speaketh blasphemies? *Who can forgive sins, but God alone*? But when Jesus perceived their thoughts, he answering said unto them, What reason ye in your hearts? Whether is easier, to say, Thy sins be forgiven thee; or to say, Rise up and walk? But that ye may know that *the Son of man hath power upon earth to forgive sins*, (he said unto the sick of the palsy,) I say unto thee, Arise, and take up thy couch, and go into thine house.
{% ref 'Luke 5:20-24' %}

Because He is God, Jesus has the power to forgive sins.

## What did Thomas call Jesus?

> And Thomas answered and said unto him, *My Lord and my God*.
{% ref 'John 20:28' %}

## Do the angels worship Jesus? What does the Father call Him?

> For unto which of the angels said he at any time, “Thou art my Son, this day have I begotten thee?” And again, “I will be to him a Father, and he shall be to me a Son?” And again, when he bringeth in the firstbegotten into the world, he saith, “And *let all the angels of God worship him*.” And of the angels he saith, “Who maketh his angels spirits, and his ministers a flame of fire.” But unto the Son he saith, “*Thy throne, O God, is for ever and ever*: a sceptre of righteousness is the sceptre of thy kingdom. Thou hast loved righteousness, and hated iniquity; therefore God, even thy God, hath anointed thee with the oil of gladness above thy fellows.”
{% ref 'Hebrews 1:5-9' %}

Not only do the angels in heaven worship Jesus, but the Father Himself calls Him God.

## What is one of the names given to Jesus in Isaiah 9?

> For unto us a child is born, unto us a son is given: and the government shall be upon his shoulder: and his name shall be called Wonderful, Counseller, *The mighty God*, The everlasting Father, The Prince of Peace.
{% ref 'Isaiah 9:6' %}

## What does Micah say about Jesus?

> But thou, Bethlehem Ephratah, though thou be little among the thousands of Judah, yet out of thee shall he come forth unto me that is to be ruler in Israel; *whose goings forth have been from of old, from everlasting*. 
{% ref 'Micah 5:2' %}

This Messianic prophecy is another echo of Jesus being “the Self-existing One.”

## Does Paul affirm Jesus’ divinity?

> For in him dwelleth *all the fulness of the Godhead bodily*.
{% ref 'Colossians 2:9' %}

> Which in his times he shall shew, who is the blessed and only Potentate, *the King of kings, and Lord of lords; who only hath immortality, dwelling in the light which no man can approach unto; whom no man hath seen, nor can see*: to whom be honour and power everlasting.
{% ref '1 Timothy 6:15-16' %}

Jesus “dwelling in unapproachable light” is a reference to His divinity, glory, and holiness, which no man can see and live.

## What claim does Jesus make in Revelation?

> I am he that liveth, and was dead; and, behold, *I am alive for evermore*, amen; and *have the keys of hell and of death*.
{% ref 'Revelation 1:18' %}

Death could not conquer Jesus because it has no power over Him who is God.

## Does Paul have anything else to say about Jesus?

> Let this mind be in you, which was also in Christ Jesus: who, *being in the form of God*, thought it not robbery to be *equal with God*: but made himself of no reputation, and took upon him the form of a servant, and was made in the likeness of men: and being found in fashion as a man, he humbled himself, and became obedient unto death, even the death of the cross. Wherefore God also hath highly exalted him, and given him a name which is above every name: that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of things in heaven, and things in earth, and things under the earth; and that *every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord*, to the glory of God the Father. Wherefore, my beloved, as ye have always obeyed, not as in my presence only, but now much more in my absence, work out your own salvation with fear and trembling.
{% ref 'Philippians 2:5-12' %}

Because Jesus is God and is equal with God, the Father, there will come a day when every human being will bow before Him and confess that He is Lord.
