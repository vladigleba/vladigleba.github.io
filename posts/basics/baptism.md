## What did Jesus tell His disciples before His ascension?

> Go ye therefore, and teach all nations, *baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost*: teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you: and, lo, I am with you alway, even unto the end of the world.
{% ct 'Matthew 28:19-20' %}

> He that *believeth and is baptized shall be saved*; but he that believeth not shall be damned.
{% ct 'Mark 16:16' %}

Just before Jesus ascended to heaven, He gave His disciples the “Great Commission”—to take the gospel to the world by sharing His teachings and encouraging those who accept Him to be baptized. In fact, the book of Mark makes an inextricable connection between believing in Jesus and being baptized, which shows that baptism is an integral part of the Christian experience.

## Why is baptism important?

> Jesus answered, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be *born of water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God*.
{% ct 'John 3:5' %}

> That if thou shalt *confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus*, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved. For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and *with the mouth confession is made unto salvation*.
{% ct 'Romans 10:9-10' %}

> For as many of you as have been *baptized into Christ have put on Christ*.
{% ct 'Galatians 3:27' %}

During His conversation with Nicodemus, Jesus made it clear that baptism is a privilege that all Christians are called to experience. Salvation is a gift from God, received through faith in Jesus Christ {% rf 'Ephesians 2:8-9' %}, and such faith is demonstrated through a public confession of Him {% rf 'Romans 10:9-10' %}. When we are baptized, we are making a public confession that we have “put on Christ”—that we have accepted Him as Lord and Savior into our hearts and have received a new name and a new identity: follower of Christ, son or daughter of God! By making a public stand for Christ, we also become His witnesses to others, inspiring them to do the same in their own lives.

## How many methods of baptism are there?

> There is one body, and one Spirit, even as ye are called in one hope of your calling; one Lord, one faith, *one baptism*, one God and Father of all, who is above all, and through all, and in you all.
{% ct 'Ephesians 4:4-6' %}

The Bible declares that there is only one true baptism, and the word itself offers a clue as to what it involves. The term “baptize” comes from the Greek word *baptizō*, which means “to immerse,” “to submerge,” or “to dip under.” This might come as a surprise to some, but the Bible never describes baptism using the words “sprinkle” or “pour.” Biblical bapstism is a full immersion in water.

## How was Jesus baptized?

> And John also was baptizing in Aenon near to Salim, *because there was much water there*: and they came, and were baptized.
{% ct 'John 3:23' %}

> Then cometh Jesus from Galilee to Jordan unto John, to be baptized of him. But John forbad him, saying, I have need to be baptized of thee, and comest thou to me? And Jesus answering said unto him, Suffer it to be so now: for thus it becometh us to fulfil all righteousness. Then he suffered him. And *Jesus, when he was baptized, went up straightway out of the water*: and, lo, the heavens were opened unto him, and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove, and lighting upon him: and lo a voice from heaven, saying, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.
{% ct 'Matthew 3:13-17' %}

> And it came to pass in those days, that Jesus came from Nazareth of Galilee, and was baptized of John in Jordan. And straightway *coming up out of the water*, he saw the heavens opened, and the Spirit like a dove descending upon him.
{% ct 'Mark 1:9-10' %}

John the Baptist chose an area with plenty of water because he practiced the biblical form of baptism--full immersion. Both Matthew and Mark make it clear that this was the type of baptism Jesus received, as they describe Him “coming up out of the water,” indicating that He had first gone down into the water to be baptized.

## Are there other examples of baptism?

> And he commanded the chariot to stand still: and *they went down both into the water*, both Philip and the eunuch; and he baptized him. And when *they were come up out of the water*, the Spirit of the Lord caught away Philip, that the eunuch saw him no more: and he went on his way rejoicing.
{% ct 'Acts 8:38-39' %}

The Bible gives the example of Philip and the Ethiopian eunuch to show that Jesus’ disciples did not change the method of baptism after His ascension. Both Philip and the eunuch went down into the water, and after Philip baptized him, they came up out of the water. This mirrors the description and form of baptism that Jesus Himself received.

## What does baptism represent?

> And now why tarriest thou? arise, and be baptized, and *wash away thy sins*, calling on the name of the Lord.
{% ct 'Acts 22:16' %}

> *Buried with him in baptism*, wherein also ye are *risen with him through the faith* of the operation of God, who hath raised him from the dead.
{% ct 'Colossians 2:12' %}

> Know ye not, that so many of us as were baptized into Jesus Christ were *baptized into his death*? Therefore we are *buried with him by baptism into death*: that like *as Christ was raised up from the dead* by the glory of the Father, even so *we also should walk in newness of life*. For if we have been planted together in the *likeness of his death*, we shall be also in the *likeness of his resurrection*: Knowing this, that *our old man is crucified with him, that the body of sin might be destroyed, that henceforth we should not serve sin*.
{% ct 'Romans 6:3-6' %}

> That *ye put off concerning the former conversation the old man*, which is corrupt according to the deceitful lusts; and be renewed in the spirit of your mind; and *that ye put on the new man*, which after God is created in righteousness and true holiness.
{% ct 'Ephesians 4:22-24' %}

Generally speaking, baptism is a symbol of cleansing from sin, which every person needs, as all have sinned {% rf 'Romans 3:23' %}. More specifically, it symbolizes the death and burial of the old life of sin and the birth of a new life in Jesus. In other words, it represents Jesus’ death, burial, and resurrection. As we experience His selfless love for us, we are motivated:
1. to die to sin in our own lives, which involves dying to self, 
2. to bury that old life under the water in baptism, and 
3. to rise to a new life in Jesus by the power of His Holy Spirit. 

Baptism is a beautiful and powerful symbol of how Jesus’ death, burial, and resurrection replace our old identity with a completely new one in Him. Using the correct form of baptism matters because any other form undermines the symbolism and meaning of baptism by immersion. Alternative forms portray a vastly different spiritual reality—one that does not reflect the burial of the old life. Biblical baptism illustrates that the Christian life is not merely about becoming a better person; it is about the complete crucifixion of the old self {% rf 'Galatians 2:20; 6:14' %}. A failure to fully surrender every area of life to Jesus results in a baptism where, in a sense, the person is “buried alive”—a distortion that robs the believer of the rich blessings Jesus longs to give {% rf 'John 15:11' %}.

## What else accompanies water baptism?

> Jesus answered, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born of water and *of the Spirit*, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God.
{% ct 'John 3:5' %}

In addition to water baptism, every sincere Christian will also receive the baptism of the Holy Spirit because a full immersion in water is not sufficient without being fully immersed by the Holy Spirit. The good news is that God is more than willing to give His Spirit to anyone who asks {% rf 'Luke 11:13' %} and desires to be transformed in life and character by the Spirit who convicts of sin and bestows on us the righteousness of Jesus {% rf 'John 16:8; Titus 3:3-7' %}. Without the Holy Spirit we cannot change ourselves {% rf 'Jeremiah 13:23' %}.

Evidence of receiving the baptism of the Spirit includes producing the fruits of the Spirit described in {% rf 'Galatians 5:22-23' false %} as well as receiving [His gifts](/posts/basics/spirit.md#what-are-the-gifts-of-the-holy-spirit), both of which enable us to be effective ambassadors for God {% rf '2 Corinthians 5:19-21' %}.

## How do I know if I’m ready for baptism?

> Go ye therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost: *teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you*: and, lo, I am with you alway, even unto the end of the world.
{% ct 'Matthew 28:19-20' %}

> He that *believeth* and is baptized shall be saved; but he that believeth not shall be damned.
{% ct 'Mark 16:16' %}

> Then Peter said unto them, *Repent*, and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins, and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost.
{% ct 'Acts 2:38' %}

> For if we have been planted together in the likeness of his death, we shall be also in the likeness of his resurrection: knowing this, that *our old man is crucified with him, that the body of sin might be destroyed, that henceforth we should not serve sin*.
{% ct 'Romans 6:5-6' %}

Baptism to the Christian is what a wedding is to a marriage--a public declaration of commitment, except in baptism it's a commitment to Jesus as my personal Savior {% rf 'Acts 8:37' %}, so it’s important to first get to know Him and understand His teachings. This is in the commission Jesus gave His disciples just before His ascension—to share His teachings in all the world and to baptize those who accept them and believe in Him. Naturally, His teachings will bring conviction of sin, leading the genuine believer to repent of past sins {% rf 'Acts 5:31' %} and choose to no longer serve sin by dying to self through the power of the Holy Spirit. This experience is known as being born of the Spirit, and if it’s present in a believer’s life then that person is ready to make the exciting, yet serious, public commitment to be faithful to Jesus even to the point of death.

Incidentally, this means that infant baptism in not appropriate because an infant is not mature enough to understand the pre-requisites or make the commitment. After all, Jesus Himself was baptized as an adult. Instead of being baptized, infants can be dedicated to God by their parents, as Jesus was {% rf 'Luke 2:21-39' %}, while the parents also dedicate themselves to do what they can to raise a child who knows and loves God—who will one day make that commitment in baptism. The Bible, however, does not specify an appropriate age to be baptized because every person’s spiritual experience and maturity is different.

## What about the thief on the cross?

> And one of the malefactors which were hanged railed on him, saying, If thou be Christ, save thyself and us. But the other answering rebuked him, saying, Dost not thou fear God, seeing thou art in the same condemnation? And we indeed justly; for we receive the due reward of our deeds: but this man hath done nothing amiss. And he said unto Jesus, *Lord, remember me when thou comest into thy kingdom*.
{% ct 'Luke 23:39-42' %}

The conversion of the thief on the cross shows that there can be unique circumstances that prevent an individual from getting baptized by immersion, and in those situations the baptism of Jesus is substituted for that person; however, this is not an excuse for someone who is able, but does not wish to get baptized. Baptism is still a very important public commitment to Jesus.

## What does baptism not do?

> For *by grace are ye saved through faith*; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God:
{% ct 'Ephesians 2:8' %}

It’s important to note that we are not saved by baptism as salvation is by grace through faith, but baptism is an act of obedience to Jesus born out of a conversion that’s marked by genuine love for and gratitude to Him. Baptism also doesn’t remove temptations, but God does promise we will not be tempted beyond what we are able to bear, which means He will always provide a way of escape {% rf '1 Corinthians 10:13' %}. And finally, baptism itself does not change the heart, but it is a symbol of a heart transformed by the power of the Holy Spirit.

## What is baptism connected with?

> *Then they that gladly received his word were baptized*: and the same day there were added unto them about three thousand souls. And they *continued stedfastly in the apostles’ doctrine and fellowship, and in breaking of bread, and in prayers*. … And they, *continuing daily with one accord in the temple*, and breaking bread from house to house, did eat their meat with gladness and singleness of heart, praising God, and having favour with all the people. And *the Lord added to the church daily such as should be saved*.
{% ct 'Acts 2:41-42, 46-47' %}

> And *He is the head of the body, the church*, who is the beginning, the firstborn from the dead, that in all things He may have the preeminence.
{% ct 'Colossians 1:18' %}

> For by one Spirit are we all *baptized into one body*, whether we be Jews or Gentiles, whether we be bond or free; and have been all made to drink into one Spirit.
{% ct '1 Corinthians 12:13' %}

When the disciples started proclaiming the teachings of Jesus, those who believed and were baptized became a part of the body of Christ, His church, of which He is Lord. The church is a community of Christ’s followers who nurture one another’s Christian walk and work together to serve others and spread the good news of the gospel. A decision for baptism, therefore, comes with the blessing of fellowship with other followers of Jesus who believe in all of His teachings, as revealed in the Bible, and by the power of the Holy Spirit, live them out.

## Can a person be rebaptized?

> He said unto them, Have ye received the Holy Ghost since ye believed? And they said unto him, We have not so much as heard whether there be any Holy Ghost. And he said unto them, Unto what then were ye baptized? And they said, Unto John’s baptism. Then said Paul, John verily baptized with the baptism of repentance, saying unto the people, that they should believe on him which should come after him, that is, on Christ Jesus. *When they heard this, they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus*.
{% ct 'Acts 19:2-5' %}

Ideally, baptism is a one-time experience, but there are exceptions. Rebaptism can be appropriate when new truth is discovered, which was the case with the group of believers who were baptized by John, but who had never heard of the Holy Spirit. After they learned this life-changing truth, they were so impacted by it that they decided to get rebaptized. Another circumstance when rebaptism is appropriate is when a person desires to return to Jesus after turning away from Him. Baptism is a marriage ceremony with Jesus, so if genuine love has been rekindled in the heart, and it’s accompanied by the commitment to be faithful through thick and thin, it can be appropriate to make a new public pledge to Jesus.

## Who has the authority to baptize?

> Then the *eleven disciples* went away into Galilee, into a mountain where Jesus had appointed them. And when they saw him, they worshipped him: but some doubted. And Jesus came and spake unto them, saying, All power is given unto me in heaven and in earth. *Go ye therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them* in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost: teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you: and, lo, I am with you alway, even unto the end of the world.
{% ct 'Matthew 28:16-20' %}

Jesus gave the authority to baptize only to His disciples, whom He commissioned to faithfully teach all the truths He had commanded them. Therefore, when the Holy Spirit leads someone to seek baptism, it is essential to [find a church](/posts/prophecy/remnant.md) that teaches all the aspects of truth that Jesus taught.

## Is it wise to put off baptism?

> And now *why tarriest thou? arise, and be baptized*, and wash away thy sins, calling on the name of the Lord.
{% ct 'Acts 22:16' %}

> And as he reasoned of righteousness, temperance, and judgment to come, Felix trembled, and answered, Go thy way for this time; *when I have a convenient season, I will call for thee*.
{% ct 'Acts 24:25' %}

When the Holy Spirit brings conviction to the heart, one of Satan’s most effective strategies is to cause that person to put off making a decision until a more convenient time, which never comes. Don’t put off baptism because you are not “good enough” or don’t feel “clean.” We begin our Christian walk as babies, not adults, and if babies waited to attempt to walk until certain they would never fall, they would never learn to walk. So if the Holy Spirit is prompting you to be baptized, the Bible invites you to make plans today without delay.

## How does God feel about a baptized person?

> I say unto you, that likewise *joy shall be in heaven over one sinner that repenteth*, more than over ninety and nine just persons, which need no repentance.
{% ct 'Luke 15:7' %}

> In that day it shall be said to Jerusalem: “Do not fear; Zion, let not your hands be weak. The Lord your God in your midst, the Mighty One, will save; *He will rejoice over you with gladness*, He will quiet you with His love, *He will rejoice over you with singing*.”
{% ct 'Zephaniah 3:16-17, NKJV' %}

Not only is there joy in heaven over every repenting sinner, but Zephaniah tells us that God Himself rejoices in song over His people! The truth is we have the ability to make heaven rejoice, and stepping into the waters of baptism to make a public commitment to Jesus is bound to bring melodies of joy to the heavenly courts.
