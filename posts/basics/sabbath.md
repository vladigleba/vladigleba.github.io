## What is the first angel’s message in Revelation 14?

> And I saw another angel fly in the midst of heaven, having the everlasting gospel to preach unto them that dwell on the earth, and to every nation, and kindred, and tongue, and people, saying with a loud voice, Fear God, and give glory to him; for the hour of his judgment is come: and *worship him that made heaven, and earth, and the sea, and the fountains of waters*.
{% ct 'Revelation 14:6, 7' %}

In Revelation 14 there are three angels proclaiming a message to the people of the world in the last days, and the first angel’s message is a call to worship the Creator God and give glory to Him.

## What is it an echo of?

> “You are worthy, O Lord, to receive glory and honor and power; for *You created all things*, and *by Your will they exist* and were created.”
{% ct 'Revelation 4:11, NKJV' %}

{% rf 'Revelation 14:6, 7' false %} is an echo of the verse above, which explains that God is worthy to receive glory, honor, and power because He is the Author of all life.

## How did God create?

> And to make all men see what is the fellowship of the mystery, which from the beginning of the world hath been hid in God, *who created all things by Jesus Christ*.
{% ct 'Ephesians 3:9' %}

> For by him [Jesus] were all things created, that are in heaven, and that are in earth, visible and invisible, whether they be thrones, or dominions, or principalities, or powers: *all things were created by him, and for him*: and he is before all things, and *by him all things consist*.
{% ct 'Colossians 1:16, 17' %}

God the Father created all things by His Son Jesus, who was fulfilling the will of His Father, and by Him it all consists and holds together!

## Which commandment identifies the Creator God?

> Remember the sabbath day, to keep it holy. Six days shalt thou labour, and do all thy work: but the seventh day is the sabbath of the LORD thy God: in it thou shalt not do any work, thou, nor thy son, nor thy daughter, thy manservant, nor thy maidservant, nor thy cattle, nor thy stranger that is within thy gates: *for in six days the LORD made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that in them is, and rested the seventh day*: wherefore the LORD blessed the sabbath day, and hallowed it.
{% ct 'Exodus 20:8-11' %}

The fourth commandment begins with “remember” because God knew His Sabbath would be forgotten. It then identifies Him as the Creator of all things, thus laying the foundation for the invitation to all people to acknowledge Him as Creator by resting on the Sabbath day, just as He rested on the seventh day as an example for us.

Moreover, the fourth commandment contains the three basic elements of a seal: name ("the Lord"), title ("your God"), and territory ("heaven and earth)." This uniquely identifies God as the author of the other nine commandments and provides the reason for His authority. In other words, the authority of all Ten Commandments rests on the fourth. Without it, any being could claim authorship of the other nine, and thus the Decalogue would lose its divine authority and rightful claim over our lives.

## What else can I learn about the Sabbath from Genesis 2?

> Thus the heavens and the earth were finished, and all the host of them. And on the seventh day God ended his work which he had made; and he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had made. And *God blessed the seventh day, and sanctified it*: because that in it he had rested from all his work which God created and made.
{% ct 'Genesis 2:1-3' %}

The reason why the fourth commandment invites me to keep the Sabbath day holy is because God blessed this specific day and sanctified it. The word used in the original text is *qadash*, which means “to be set apart or consecrated.” In other words, the seventh day, is special to God and unlike any of the other six days of the week.

## Who is the Sabbath really for?

> And he said unto them, *The sabbath was made for man*, and not man for the sabbath: therefore the Son of man is Lord also of the sabbath.
{% ct 'Mark 2:27, 28' %}

The Sabbath was made for us. When God created it, He did not need the rest it provided, because God does not get tired. Nor had He worked in the way we undertand labor, since apart from forming Adam and Eve, all of His prior creation was spoken into existence.

## Why was it given to us?

> Moreover also I gave them my sabbaths, *to be a sign* between me and them, that they *might know that I am the LORD that sanctify them*. ... And hallow my sabbaths; and they shall be a sign between me and you, *that ye may know that I am the LORD your God*.
{% ct 'Ezekiel 20:12, 20' %}

> And remember that thou wast a servant in the land of Egypt, and *that the LORD thy God brought thee out thence through a mighty hand and by a stretched out arm*: therefore the LORD thy God commanded thee to keep the sabbath day.
{% ct 'Deuteronomy 5:15' %}

The Sabbath is a sign of my acknowledgment that:
1. God is Lord because He created this world in six consecutive, literal, 24-hour days {% rf 'Exodus 20:8, 11' %}. The Sabbath is a weekly reminder that I have a Creator who desires to have a relationship with me. This truth carries several important implications: I am not self-created; I am not a god, nor can I become one; I possess no inherent divinity—no inner godhood or divine spark; I do not have an immortal soul, for only God is immortal {% rf '1 Timothy 6:15, 16' %}; and I did not come into existence by accident or through a long process of evolution. My life has meaning and purpose.
2. God is Lord of my life because He is the One who redeems and sanctifies me. In the Bible, the Israelites' bondage in Egypt symbolizes the spiritual bondage of sin from which God delivers me. Therefore, the Sabbath is a weekly reminder that, in Jesus, victory over sin is available to all. After all, Jesus would not have told the woman caught in adultery to “go and sin no more” if that were impossible {% rf 'John 8:11' %}. Moreover, the Sabbath is a sign that I am not saved by my own works, but by faith in His completed work on the cross, as well as His ongoing work as my Intercessor in the heavenly sanctuary (see ["Finding Hope in the Sanctuary"](../gospel/sanctuary.md#do-i-have-a-high-priest-today)).

In Eden, God rested on the seventh day from His work of creation, and in the tomb, Jesus rested on the same day from His work of redemption. Therefore, the Sabbath serves as a memorial of both acts. It is a weekly rest in Jesus, during which I set aside my secular work and worldly duties to connect with and honor Him—no matter how busy life may become.

## Did Jesus keep the Sabbath?

> And he came to Nazareth, where he had been brought up: and, *as his custom was, he went into the synagogue on the sabbath day*, and stood up for to read.
{% ct 'Luke 4:16' %}

> And came down to Capernaum, a city of Galilee, and taught them on the sabbath days.
{% ct 'Luke 4:31' %}

> And they went into Capernaum; and straightway *on the sabbath day he entered into the synagogue*, and taught.
{% ct 'Mark 1:21' %}

> And *when the sabbath day was come, he began to teach in the synagogue*: and many hearing him were astonished, saying, From whence hath this man these things? and what wisdom is this which is given unto him, that even such mighty works are wrought by his hands?
{% ct 'Mark 6:2' %}

Luke tells us that going to the synagogue on the Sabbath day was a habit, not just an occasional occurrence, for Jesus.

## Did His followers keep it?

> And that day was the preparation, and *the sabbath drew on*. And the women also, which came with him from Galilee, followed after, and beheld the sepulchre, and how his body was laid. And they returned, and prepared spices and ointments; and *rested the sabbath day according to the commandment*.
{% ct 'Luke 23:54-56' %}

> Now *upon the first day of the week*, very early in the morning, *they came unto the sepulchre*, bringing the spices which they had prepared, and certain others with them.
{% ct 'Luke 24:1' %}

The Bible is clear that His followers kept the Sabbath. In fact, they even stopped their work of anointing His body in order to keep it according to the commandment. They ended up coming back on Sunday, the first day of the week, after the Sabbath was over, to finish their work.

## Did Jesus expect it to be kept after His resurrection?

> But pray ye that your flight be not in the winter, neither *on the sabbath day*.
{% ct 'Matthew 24:20' %}

Jesus warned about the destruction of Jerusalem by Rome, which occured in A.D. 70, and made it clear that the Sabbath would be kept long after His resurrection.

## Did His followers keep it after His resurrection?

> And *he reasoned in the synagogue every sabbath*, and persuaded the Jews and the Greeks.
{% ct 'Acts 18:4' %}

> And when the Jews were gone out of the synagogue, the *Gentiles besought that these words might be preached to them the next sabbath*. Now when the congregation was broken up, many of the Jews and religious proselytes followed Paul and Barnabas: who, speaking to them, persuaded them to continue in the grace of God. And *the next sabbath day came almost the whole city together to hear the word of God*.
{% ct 'Acts 13:42-44' %}

> And Paul, *as his manner was*, went in unto them, and *three sabbath days reasoned with them out of the scriptures*.
{% ct 'Acts 17:2' %}

> But when they departed from Perga, they came to Antioch in Pisidia, and *went into the synagogue on the Sabbath day*, and sat down.
{% ct 'Acts 13:14' %}

Christ's apostles kept the Sabbath themselves and taught others to do the same, including the converted Gentiles.

## On what day was John, the Revelator, in the Spirit?

> I was in the Spirit *on the Lord's day*, and heard behind me a great voice, as of a trumpet.
{% ct 'Revelation 1:10' %}

## What is the Lord’s Day?

> For the Son of man *is Lord even of the sabbath day*.
{% ct 'Matthew 12:8' %}

> And hallow *my sabbaths*; and they shall be a sign between me and you, that ye may know that I am the LORD your God.
{% ct 'Ezekiel 20:20' %}

> Speak thou also unto the children of Israel, saying, Verily *my sabbaths* ye shall keep: for it is a sign between me and you throughout your generations; that ye may know that I am the LORD that doth sanctify you.
{% ct 'Exodus 31:13' %}

God is Lord of the Sabbath, the seventh day {% rf 'Exodus 20:11' %}. Notice that He calls these days “My Sabbaths,” meaning it is His special day, which He blessed and sanctified to be a sign between Him and His people of His creative, redeeming, and sanctifying power.

## Does God change His ways?

> Jesus Christ the *same yesterday, and to day, and for ever*.
{% ct 'Hebrews 13:8' %}

> Every good gift and every perfect gift is from above, and cometh down from the Father of lights, *with whom is no variableness, neither shadow of turning*.
{% ct 'James 1:17' %}

> My covenant will I not break, *nor alter the thing that is gone out of my lips*.
{% ct 'Psalm 89:34' %}

> And it is easier for heaven and earth to pass, *than one tittle of the law to fail*.
{% ct 'Luke 16:17' %}

> Heaven and earth shall pass away: but *my words shall not pass away*.
{% ct 'Luke 21:33' %}

God is not a fallible man who makes mistakes, changes His mind, or alters His commandments. The Decalogue is a transcript of His character (see ["God's Law of Love"](../gospel/law.md#what-is-gods-law-a-reflection-of)) and, as such, it can never be altered, which is good news, because it means His righteous and loving character will never change! Although some have claimed that His commandments have been altered—and the Bible predicted such attempts—the truth remains that His commandments are unchangeable (see ["God's Law Changed"](../prophecy/change.md)).

## Will the Sabbath be kept in heaven?

> For as the new heavens and the new earth, which I will make, shall remain before me, saith the LORD, so shall your seed and your name remain. And it shall come to pass, that from one new moon to another, and *from one sabbath to another, shall all flesh come to worship before me*, saith the LORD.
{% ct 'Isaiah 66:22, 23' %}

The Sabbath will continue to be kept in heaven as a beautiful weekly testament to God’s power to fully redeem fallen humanity from a world of sin and to sanctify them for a new life in heaven. In heaven, it will also take on a new dimension as a memorial of His power to redeem the world itself from the curse of sin after He recreates it anew!
