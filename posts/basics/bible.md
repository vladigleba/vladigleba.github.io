## How much of the Bible is inspired? By whom? For what purpose?

> *All* Scripture is given *by inspiration of God*, and is profitable *for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness*, that the man of God may be perfect, thoroughly furnished unto all good works.
{% ct '2 Timothy 3:16-17' %}

## How did it maintain its miraculous unity?

> Knowing this first, that no prophecy of the scripture is of any private interpretation. For the prophecy came not in old time by the will of man: but holy men of God spake *as they were moved by the Holy Ghost*.
{% ct '2 Peter 1:20-21' %}

The Bible was written over a period of 1,500 years by about 40 different authors whose education and background varied greatly. The Bible’s unity under these circumstances is astonishing and can only be explained by divine inspiration.

## Can the Bible be trusted?
  
> *Thy word is true from the beginning*, and every one of thy righteous judgments endureth for ever.
{% ct 'Psalm 119:160' %}

## Hasn’t it been corrupted over the ages?

> The words of the LORD are *pure words*, as silver tried in a furnace of earth, purified seven times. Thou shalt keep them, O LORD, thou shalt *preserve them* from this generation for ever.
{% ct 'Psalm 12:6-7' %}

God’s word is truth, and He will ensure it stays that way.

## Can God’s Word be changed or done away with?

> Heaven and earth shall pass away, but *my words shall not pass away*.
{% ct 'Matthew 24:35' %}

> For all flesh is as grass, and all the glory of man as the flower of grass. The grass withereth, and the flower thereof falleth away: but *the word of the LORD endureth for ever*. And this is the word which by the gospel is preached unto you.
{% ct '1 Peter 1:24-25' %}

## Why did God give us the Scriptures?

> For whatsoever things were written aforetime were written *for our learning*, that we through patience and comfort of the scriptures *might have hope*.
{% ct 'Romans 15:4' %}

> For this is good and acceptable in the sight of God our Savior, *who will have all men to be saved, and to come unto the knowledge of the truth*.
{% ct '1 Timothy 2:3-4' %}

> And that from a child thou hast known the holy scriptures, which are able *to make thee wise unto salvation* through faith which is in Christ Jesus.
{% ct '2 Timothy 3:15' %}

God gave us the Scriptures so we can learn about His character and be grounded in His truth while navigating a world of deception, so that through it we might be saved from sin and have hope of eternal life.

## Who do the Scriptures point me to?

> Search the scriptures; for in them ye think ye have eternal life: and they are they which *testify of me*.
{% ct 'John 5:39' %}

> Looking unto Jesus the *author and finisher of our faith*; who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross, despising the shame, and is set down at the right hand of the throne of God.
{% ct 'Hebrews 12:2' %}

> Jesus saith unto him, *I am the way, the truth, and the life*: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.
{% ct 'John 14:6' %}

All the stories of the Bible point me to Jesus, the Author and Finisher of my faith.

## How can I be blessed by the Bible?

> *Study* to shew thyself approved unto God, a workman that needeth not to be ashamed, rightly dividing the word of truth.
{% ct '2 Timothy 2:15' %}

> These were more noble than those in Thessalonica, in that they received the word with all readiness of mind, and *searched the scriptures daily*, whether those things were so.
{% ct 'Acts 17:11' %}

The Bible is unlike any other book because it is my Creator and Redeemer’s special gift to me. He speaks to me through it, and it is my privilege to read it daily because by doing so I’ll draw closer to Him. Every relationship is built on spending quality time together, and my relationship with Jesus is no different.

## Is God’s Word as important as physical food?

> But he answered and said, It is written, Man shall not live by bread alone, but by *every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God*.
{% ct 'Matthew 4:4' %}

> Neither have I gone back from the commandment of his lips; I have esteemed the words of his mouth *more than my necessary food*.
{% ct 'Job 23:12' %}

> Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that believeth on me hath everlasting life. *I am that bread of life*. Your fathers did eat manna in the wilderness, and are dead. This is the bread which cometh down from heaven, that a man may eat thereof, and not die. I am the living bread which came down from heaven: *if any man eat of this bread, he shall live for ever*: and the bread that I will give is my flesh, which I will give for the life of the world.
{% ct 'John 6:47-51' %}

Jesus is the spiritual bread that brings everlasting life, and we “eat” it whenever we read His Word. Our need for Him is actually greater than our need for physical food.

## Who did Jesus say will help me understand the Bible?

> Howbeit when he, *the Spirit of truth*, is come, he *will guide you into all truth*: for he shall not speak of himself; but whatsoever he shall hear, that shall he speak: and he will shew you things to come.
{% ct 'John 16:13' %}

## Why should I ask for the Holy Spirit’s guidance?

> Which things also we speak, not in the words which man’s wisdom teacheth, but which the Holy Ghost teacheth; comparing spiritual things with spiritual. But the natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God: for they are foolishness unto him: neither can he know them, *because they are spiritually discerned*.
{% ct '1 Corinthians 2:13-14' %}

Because spiritual things are spiritually discerned and because the Bible is full of stories with symbolism, I need the Holy Spirit to open my spiritual eyes and help me bring these stories to life. Humility and a teachable attitude is also a crucial part of it.

## How should I study the Bible?

> Whom shall he teach knowledge? and whom shall he make to understand doctrine? them that are weaned from the milk, and drawn from the breasts. For precept must be upon precept, *precept upon precept; line upon line*, line upon line; *here a little, and there a little*.
{% ct 'Isaiah 28:9-10' %}

God is not a God of contradiction or confusion, so it’s important to not take verses out of context and build a doctrine based on a verse or two. When studying a particular topic, it’s critical to identify as many verses as possible dealing with the topic and to let the Bible clarify itself on what seem, due to our misunderstanding, like contradictory ones.

## What will the truth in God’s Word do to me?

> *Sanctify them* through thy truth: thy word is truth.
{% ct 'John 17:17' %}

> But we all, with open face *beholding as in a glass the glory of the LORD, are changed into the same image* from glory to glory, even as by the Spirit of the LORD.
{% ct '2 Corinthians 3:18' %}

> For *the word of God is living and powerful*, and sharper than any two-edged sword, piercing even to the division of soul and spirit, and of joints and marrow, and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart.
{% ct 'Hebrews 4:12, NKJV' %}

Reading the Bible brings me into contact with God’s divine mind and holy character, and by beholding it daily, I become more like Him through the work of the Holy Spirit. There is a reason the book of Hebrews calls the word of God living and powerful!

## If I’m willing to follow God’s will, what promise do I have?

> If anyone wills to do His will, *he shall know concerning the doctrine*, whether it is from God or whether I speak on My own authority.
{% ct 'John 7:17, NKJV' %}

If I’m willing to follow it, the promise is God will reveal His truth to me.
