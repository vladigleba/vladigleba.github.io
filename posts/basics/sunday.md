## Is the Sabbath temporary or perpetual?

> Wherefore the children of Israel shall keep the sabbath, to observe the sabbath throughout their generations, *for a perpetual covenant. It is a sign between me and the children of Israel for ever*: for in six days the LORD made heaven and earth, and on the seventh day he rested, and was refreshed. And he gave unto Moses, when he had made an end of communing with him upon mount Sinai, two tables of testimony, *tables of stone*, written with the finger of God.
{% ct 'Exodus 31:16-18' %}

The Ten Commandments, of which the Sabbath is a part, were written by the finger of God on tablets of stone rather than on materials subject to decay, such as wood or clay, as a testament to their timelessness {% rf 'Matthew 5:17-18' %}.

## Was the Sabbath for the Jewish people only?

> Thus the heavens and the earth were finished, and all the host of them. And on the seventh day God ended his work which he had made; and he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had made. And *God blessed the seventh day, and sanctified it: because that in it he had rested from all his work which God created and made*.
{% ct 'Genesis 2:1-3' %}

> For as the new heavens and the new earth, which I will make, shall remain before me, saith the LORD, so shall your seed and your name remain. And it shall come to pass, that from one new moon to another, and *from one sabbath to another, shall all flesh come to worship before me*, saith the LORD.
{% ct 'Isaiah 66:22-23' %}

The seventh-day Sabbath was set apart, blessed, and sanctified in the very first week of creation, long before there was a Jewish nation, and it will be kept even in heaven as a testament to God as our Creator and Redeemer. The Sabbath was instituted in Eden for all humanity, and as long as we are His creation, whom He has redeemed, so long will the Sabbath stand.

## How many need sanctification?

> For *all have sinned*, and come short of the glory of God.
{% ct 'Romans 3:23' %}

> Moreover also I gave them my sabbaths, to be a sign between me and them, that they might know that *I am the LORD that sanctify them*.
{% ct 'Ezekiel 20:12' %}

Because all have sinned, all need the sanctifying power of Christ—of which the Sabbath is a sign; therefore, it cannot be a sign for the Jewish nation only, for sin is no respecter of persons, just as God’s power to sanctify is no respecter of sinners. As God set the Sabbath apart as a day for Himself, so He sets us apart as a people for Himself {% rf '1 Peter 2:9; 2 Corinthians 6:17-18' %}.

## Is the Sabbath an antidote to salvation by works?

> For he spake in a certain place of the seventh day on this wise, and God did rest the seventh day from all his works. … There remaineth therefore a rest to the people of God. *For he that is entered into his rest, he also hath ceased from his own works, as God did from his. Let us labour therefore to enter into that rest*, lest any man fall after the same example of unbelief.
{% ct 'Hebrews 4:4-6, 9-11' %}

The Sabbath is a memorial of God as both Creator and Redeemer. Just as He rested from His work of creation on the seventh day, so Jesus rested from His work of redemption in the tomb. The Sabbath, therefore, is a sign of resting in Christ by faith in His completed work on my behalf. In other words, to deny the Sabbath is, in essence, to deny salvation by faith. Because I cannot sanctify or save myself, I am invited to cease striving for salvation by my own works and to rest in the righteous life of Jesus instead. By resting on the seventh day, I acknowledge this sublime truth.

## What happened as the Sabbath approached after Jesus died?

> And that day was the preparation, and the sabbath drew on. And the women also, which came with him from Galilee, followed after, and beheld the sepulchre, and how his body was laid. And they returned, and prepared spices and ointments; and *rested the sabbath day according to the commandment*.
{% ct 'Luke 23:54-56' %}

The Bible points out that, since it was the Day of Preparation (Friday) and the Sabbath was about to [begin at sunset](/posts/basics/keeping.md#when-does-the-sabbath-start-and-end), Jesus’ followers were so concerned about keeping the Sabbath that they even stopped their labor of love in preparing the body of their beloved Savior for burial. They rested on the Sabbath, as commanded, and returned early on Sunday morning to resume their unfinished work.

## What happened on the first day?

> Now upon the *first day of the week*, very early in the morning, *they came unto the sepulchre*, bringing the spices which they had prepared, and certain others with them.
{% ct 'Luke 24:1' %}

> In the end of the sabbath, as it began to dawn toward the *first day of the week, came Mary Magdalene and the other Mary to see the sepulchre*.
{% ct 'Matthew 28:1' %}

> And very early in the morning the *first day of the week, they came unto the sepulchre* at the rising of the sun.
{% ct 'Mark 16:2' %}

> The *first day of the week cometh Mary Magdalene early, when it was yet dark, unto the sepulchre*, and seeth the stone taken away from the sepulchre.
{% ct 'John 20:1' %}

It is important to note that Jesus’ followers returned to the tomb because they still had unfinished burial work to complete. Since they brought spices with them, it is evident they did not expect to find Him resurrected, so their Sunday morning labor of love was not an act of honoring His resurrection but rather a continuation of their burial work.

## Did Jesus command the keeping of Sunday?

> Now when Jesus was risen early the *first day of the week, he appeared first to Mary Magdalene*, out of whom he had cast seven devils. And she went and told them that had been with him, as they mourned and wept.
{% ct 'Mark 16:9' %}

> Jesus saith unto her, Woman, why weepest thou? whom seekest thou? She, supposing him to be the gardener, saith unto him, Sir, if thou have borne him hence, tell me where thou hast laid him, and I will take him away. Jesus saith unto her, Mary. She turned herself, and saith unto him, Rabboni; which is to say, Master. *Jesus saith unto her, Touch me not; for I am not yet ascended to my Father: but go to my brethren, and say unto them, I ascend unto my Father, and your Father; and to my God, and your God*. Mary Magdalene came and told the disciples that she had seen the Lord, and that he had spoken these things unto her.
{% ct 'John 20:15-18' %}

After His resurrection, Jesus had multiple opportunities to instruct His followers to keep Sunday as the new Sabbath in honor of His resurrection, but this He never did. When He appeared to Mary Magdalene that morning, there was no mention of Sunday at all. Considering the many Old Testament passages in which God directly commands the observance of the seventh-day Sabbath, one would reasonably expect at least one verse in the New Testament where Jesus—or His Father—commands His followers to keep Sunday instead. Yet no such verse exists. All we have is alleged circumstantial evidence, which, when closely examined, falls apart as well.

## How do we honor Jesus’ resurrection?

> Know ye not, that so many of us as were baptized into Jesus Christ were baptized into his death? Therefore *we are buried with him by baptism into death: that like as Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the Father, even so we also should walk in newness of life*. For if we have been planted together in the likeness of his death, we shall be also in the likeness of his resurrection: knowing this, that *our old man is crucified with him, that the body of sin might be destroyed, that henceforth we should not serve sin*. For he that is dead is freed from sin. Now if we be dead with Christ, we believe that we shall also live with him.
{% ct 'Romans 6:3-8' %}

Jesus instituted [baptism by immersion](/posts/basics/baptism.md) as a symbol of His death, burial, and resurrection. In baptism, a person goes briefly under the water, representing death to sin and burial with Christ, and then rises out of the water to a new life in and for Christ.

## Didn’t the disciples break bread on the first day?

> And upon the *first day of the week, when the disciples came together to break bread*, Paul preached unto them, ready to depart on the morrow; and continued his speech until midnight.
{% ct 'Acts 20:7' %}

> And they continued stedfastly in the apostles’ doctrine and fellowship, and *in breaking of bread*, and in prayers. … And they, *continuing daily with one accord in the temple, and breaking bread from house to house*, did eat their meat with gladness and singleness of heart.
{% ct 'Acts 2:42, 46' %}

The meeting in which bread was broken on the first day of the week occurred because Paul was leaving the next day. Apart from this unique circumstance, the meeting had no special significance, since the early Christians broke bread daily.

## What about John 20:19?

> Mary Magdalene came and told the disciples that she had seen the Lord, and that he had spoken these things unto her. Then *the same day at evening, being the first day of the week*, when the doors were shut where the disciples were assembled for fear of the Jews, *came Jesus and stood in the midst*, and saith unto them, Peace be unto you. And when he had so said, he shewed unto them his hands and his side. Then were the disciples glad, when they saw the Lord. Then said Jesus to them again, Peace be unto you: as my Father hath sent me, even so send I you.
{% ct 'John 20:18-21' %}

> Afterward he appeared unto the eleven as they sat at meat, and upbraided them with their unbelief and hardness of heart, *because they believed not them which had seen him after he was risen*.
{% ct 'Mark 16:14' %}

Mark tells us that after Jesus’ disciples heard He had risen, they did not at first believe the reports, so later that same day He appeared to them in person. Since they did not believe He had risen, they could not have gathered to honor His resurrection. Moreover, after He appeared, He had the perfect opportunity to declare Sunday holy, but—just as in His interaction with Mary—He did not do so. Finally, according to the Bible, days begin at sunset {% rf 'Genesis 1:5' %}; thus, biblically—and for the Jews—this Sunday evening gathering would actually have been Monday.

## How about 1 Corinthians 16:2?

> Now concerning the collection for the saints, as I have given order to the churches of Galatia, even so do ye. Upon the *first day of the week let every one of you lay by him in store, as God hath prospered him, that there be no gatherings when I come*. And when I come, whomsoever ye shall approve by your letters, them will I send to bring your liberality unto Jerusalem.
{% ct '1 Corinthians 16:1-3' %}

In this passage, Paul is encouraging the Corinthians to remember their fellow believers in Judea, who were experiencing a famine {% rf 'Acts 11:27-30' %}, by putting money aside on Sunday, the day when financial matters were typically settled, after the Sabbath had passed, so that the funds would be ready when he visited them. The money was to be set aside privately, according to each person’s financial ability, and on a weekly basis rather than in a one-time donation, in order to encourage systematic giving. Nothing in these passages indicates that a worship gathering occurred on Sunday or that these offerings were collected during such a service.

## What about Romans 14:5-6?

> *One man esteemeth one day above another: another esteemeth every day alike. Let every man be fully persuaded in his own mind*. He that regardeth the day, regardeth it unto the Lord; and he that regardeth not the day, to the Lord he doth not regard it. He that eateth, eateth to the Lord, for he giveth God thanks; and he that eateth not, to the Lord he eateth not, and giveth God thanks.
{% ct 'Romans 14:5-6' %}

Looking at the context, verse 1 shows that Paul is addressing “doubtful disputations” {% rf 'Romans 14:1' %}, meaning issues of personal preference related to ceremonial practices. Verses 2 and 3 offer further insight: the controversy was actually about fasting {% rf 'Romans 14:2-3, 6' %}. Some Jewish Christians thought all believers were obligated to fast on specific days; by contrast, Gentile Christians, who were unfamiliar with such ceremonial observances, had a different view. Seeking reconciliation, Paul urged them to stop passing judgment on one another in these matters. The Sabbath, however, cannot be considered a “doubtful disputation,” since it is not part of the ceremonial law; rather, it belongs to God’s unchanging, moral law—the Ten Commandments—established at creation.

## How about Colossians 2:16-17?

> *Let no man therefore judge you* in meat, or in drink, or in respect of a holyday [festival], or of the new moon, *or of the sabbath days*: which are a shadow of things to come; but the body is of Christ.
{% ct 'Colossians 2:16-17' %}

The fact that the passage mentions food, drink, festivals, and new moons in connection with “sabbath days” indicates that, once again, it is referring to the ceremonial laws. These are described as “a shadow of things to come” because they all pointed forward to Christ. When the veil of the temple was supernaturally torn from top to bottom at Christ’s death, God signified that these ceremonial laws had met their fulfillment in His Son and were no longer needed {% rf 'Ephesians 2:14-15' %}, for the great sacrifice to which they all pointed had been made.

In contrast to the Ten Commandments, which were written by God Himself on stone and placed *inside* the ark of the covenant {% rf 'Deuteronomy 10:3-5' %}, the ceremonial laws were written by Moses on parchment and placed *beside* the ark {% rf 'Deuteronomy 31:24-26' %}. The “sabbath days” mentioned as part of the ceremonial law refer to the yearly sabbaths described in {% rf 'Leviticus 23:24-38' false %}, not the weekly Sabbath that is part of the moral law. These annual sabbaths fell on specific days of the month each year (for example, the first, ninth, tenth, or fifteenth day), yet they were still called sabbaths because the people were to rest from their work on those days.

## What is the Lord’s day?

> I was in the Spirit *on the Lord’s day*, and heard behind me a great voice, as of a trumpet.
{% ct 'Revelation 1:10' %}

> And he said unto them, The sabbath was made for man, and not man for the sabbath: Therefore *the Son of man is Lord also of the sabbath*.
{% ct 'Mark 2:27-28' %}

> But *the seventh day is the sabbath of the LORD* thy God: in it thou shalt not do any work, thou, nor thy son, nor thy daughter, thy manservant, nor thy maidservant, nor thy cattle, nor thy stranger that is within thy gates.
{% ct 'Exodus 20:10' %}

> Six days shall work be done: but *the seventh day is the sabbath of rest*, a holy convocation; ye shall do no work therein: *it is the sabbath of the LORD* in all your dwellings.
{% ct 'Leviticus 23:3' %}

Biblically, there is only one day that the Lord God claims as His own—the seventh-day Sabbath. Jesus affirmed this, and the fourth commandment clearly identifies it as such. Unfortunately, “the Lord’s day” is widely misinterpreted as referring to Sunday, even though there is no Scriptural evidence to support this.

## What did Jesus teach about the law?

> Think not that I am come to destroy the law, or the prophets: *I am not come to destroy, but to fulfil*. For verily I say unto you, till heaven and earth pass, *one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law*, till all be fulfilled.
{% ct 'Matthew 5:17-18' %}

There are no verses in the Bible showing that Jesus changed the fourth commandment to mean observing Sunday instead of Saturday, nor did He instruct others to do so later on. On the contrary, His mission was to fulfill the law and to uphold and expand it beyond the mere “letter” of the law to include the “spirit” of the law as well. For instance, Jesus expanded the commandment against adultery to include lust {% rf 'Matthew 5:28' %} and the commandment against murder to include hatred {% rf 'Matthew 5:21-22' %}.

Law is the foundation of all government—both on earth and in heaven. Since Jesus does not change, His government, and therefore, His law, cannot change; otherwise, the wisdom, authority, and stability of His rule would immediately come into question. After all, if one of His commandments can change, why not the other nine? Most people agree with His prohibitions against having other gods, idolatry, blasphemy, dishonoring parents, murder, theft, adultery, bearing false witness, or covetousness. But what about the fourth commandment? Many acknowledge the need for weekly rest, yet the specific day on which to rest is often regarded as a matter of personal opinion.

The Sabbath commandment is the only one that establishes God’s authority to give the other nine—by the simple fact that we are the created and He is the Creator. Furthermore, without the fourth commandment, anyone could have given the other nine. The Sabbath, therefore, stands as [His signature](/posts/basics/sabbath.md#which-commandment-identifies-the-creator-god) upon the entire Decalogue.

But does God really care about the day we honor? Yes, He does. Did He care about the tree from which Eve ate? Most definitely. Does He mean what He says? Absolutely. Ultimately, the day we choose to honor is both a test of obedience and a question of authority: whose authority will I acknowledge and submit to—God’s or someone else’s? It is a simple yet profound decision that every person must make.
