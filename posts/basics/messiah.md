But He was *wounded* for our transgressions, He was *bruised* for our iniquities: the chastisement of our peace was upon Him; and *with His stripes we are healed*. All we like sheep have gone astray; we have turned every one to his own way; and the Lord hath laid on Him the iniquity of us all. *He was oppressed, and He was afflicted, yet He opened not His mouth*: He is brought as a lamb to the slaughter, and as a sheep before her shearers is dumb, so He openeth not His mouth.

> Purge out therefore the old leaven, that ye may be a new lump, as ye are unleavened. *For even Christ our passover is sacrificed for us*.

In an incredible fulfillment of prophecy, Jesus, the Passover lamb to whom all the prior Passover feasts were pointing, died on the fourteenth day of the Hebrew month of Abib at about the ninth hour {% rf 'Matthew 27:46-50' %}.

## Would any of His bones be broken?
