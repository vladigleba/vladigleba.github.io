## Who is the true owner of everything on earth?

> In the beginning *God created the heaven and the earth*.
{% ref 'Genesis 1:1' %}

> The *earth is the LORD’S*, and the fulness thereof; the world, and *they that dwell therein*.
{% ref 'Psalm 24:1' %}

> For *every beast of the forest is mine, and the cattle upon a thousand hills*. I know all the fowls of the mountains: and the wild beasts of the field are mine. If I were hungry, I would not tell thee: for *the world is mine, and the fulness thereof*.
{% ref 'Psalm 50:10-12' %}

The Bible teaches that the earth and everything in it belongs to God because He is its Creator; we are simply managers, or stewards, of His property and His goods (<a>Matthew 25:14</a>).

## From whom do financial blessings flow?

> The *silver is mine*, and the *gold is mine*, saith the LORD of hosts.
{% ref 'Haggai 2:8' %}

> But thou shalt remember the LORD thy God: for *it is he that giveth thee power to get wealth*, that he may establish his covenant which he sware unto thy fathers, as it is this day.
{% ref 'Deuteronomy 8:18' %}

> *Every good gift and every perfect gift is from above*, and cometh down from the Father of lights, with whom is no variableness, neither shadow of turning.
{% ref 'James 1:17' %}

God is also the true owner of all the wealth of the world, and it is He who gives us power to obtain the wealth that we have. In fact, James says that God is the source of <i>all</i> our blessings, not just the financial ones.

## What percentage of income belongs to the Lord?

> And all the tithe of the land, whether of the seed of the land, or of the fruit of the tree, is the LORD'S: it is holy unto the LORD. ... And concerning the tithe of the herd, or of the flock, even of whatsoever passeth under the rod, *the tenth shall be holy unto the LORD*.
{% ref 'Leviticus 27:30, 32' %}

The Bible says that a tenth of our income belongs to God (the word “tithe” means “a tenth”). This means that when we tithe we aren’t making a gift but are simply returning what already belongs to Him. Tithing, perhaps more than anything else, tends to reveal the true posture of our heart, because when it truly belongs to Him, tithe is returned cheerfully (<a>2 Corinthians 9:7</a>), out of love and gratitude for Him and as an act of faith that He will continue to take care of us in the future.

Some may think that they cannot afford to tithe, but the truth is a person cannot afford <i>not</i> to tithe. Because God has promised a blessing on those who tithe, the 90% that is blessed by God will go much father than the 100% without His blessing. God invites anyone who is unsure about tithing to put Him to the test and see how faithful He will be to His promise (<a>Malachi 3:10</a>).

Incidentally, Adam and Eve failed the test of trusting God because, out of all the trees they could freely eat from, they took of the one that was not theirs. Similarly, all the blessings we have in life are from God (<a>James 1:17</a>), but He only claims a tenth of our income as His. In reality, it’s not our money that He wants, but our loyalty and trust, because when we tithe, we enter into a partnership with Him, acknowledging His blessings and trusting that He will continue to provide.

## What was the tithe instituted for?

> And, behold, *I have given the children of Levi all the tenth in Israel for an inheritance, for their service which they serve*, even the service of the tabernacle of the congregation.
{% ref 'Numbers 18:21' %}

When the Israelites entered the Promised Land, the tribe of Levi received certain cities from God, but they did not receive a large plot of land to live off, like the other tribes did, because the tribe of Levi was set apart for ministry in the sanctuary, and so God arranged to support them with the tithe as their source of income.

## What about the ministers of today?

> Do ye not know that they which minister about holy things live of the things of the temple? and they which wait at the altar are partakers with the altar? Even so hath the Lord ordained that *they which preach the gospel should live of the gospel*.
{% ref '1 Corinthians 9:13, 14' %}

> Bring ye all the tithes into the storehouse, *that there may be meat [food] in mine house*, and prove me now herewith, saith the LORD of hosts, if I will not open you the windows of heaven, and pour you out a blessing, that there shall not be room enough to receive it.
{% ref 'Malachi 3:10' %}

> For the Scripture says, “You shall not muzzle an ox while it treads out the grain,” and, “The *laborer is worthy of his wages*.”
{% ref '1 Timothy 5:18, NKJV' %}

Paul is clear that tithing is still God’s method of supporting the ministers of today as they dedicate their lives to the preaching of the gospel. This gives every follower of Jesus the privilege to participate in the blessing of spreading the gospel throughout the world. God confirms this in the book of Malachi when He invites His followers to bring their tithe into His storehouse so that it could be provisioned with food for the priests ministering in the temple (<a>Nehemiah 10:37, 38</a>). Today’s equivalent of the storehouse would be the church, which then uses the tithe to support its pastors. By the way, Malachi makes it clear that the tithe is to be used solely for the work of ministry, nothing else.

Some may also wonder whether tithing comes out of pre- or post-tax income, but the truth is that it’s not possible to actually outgive God (<a>Luke 6:38</a>), so if the government gets a cut from our gross then certainly our heavenly Father deserves better than what is left after tax.

## Did Jesus say anything about tithing?

> Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye pay tithe of mint and anise and cummin, and have omitted the weightier matters of the law, judgment, mercy, and faith: *these ought ye to have done, and not to leave the other undone*.
{% ref 'Matthew 23:23' %}

Here Jesus pointed out that it is possible to do the right thing and still have an uncoverted heart. The Pharisees were careful to observe religious principles, but they did not experience the converting power of the Holy Spirit upon the heart. This conversion is what Jesus referred to when He told Nicodemus that one cannot enter the kingdom of God without being born again (<a>John 3:3-5</a>), but once it takes place, the fruits of the Spirit are then evident in the life (<a>Galatians 5:22-25</a>). This is why Jesus rebuked the Pharisees for failing to show justice, mercy, and grace, but notice that He did commend their practice of returning tithe.

## Is tithing only for the Jewish people?

> And Melchizedek king of Salem brought forth bread and wine: and he was the priest of the most high God. And he blessed him, and said, Blessed be Abram of the most high God, possessor of heaven and earth, and blessed be the most high God, which hath delivered thine enemies into thy hand. *And he gave him tithes of all*.
{% ref 'Genesis 14:20' %}

> And this stone, which I have set for a pillar, shall be God's house: and *of all that thou shalt give me I will surely give the tenth unto thee*.
{% ref 'Genesis 28:22' %}

Genesis tells us that tithing was practiced by Abram and Jacob before the existance of the Israelite nation, which means that God gives everyone the privilege to honor Him by returning a tenth of His blessings. This also means that tithing was not abolished at the cross because it was never limited to the laws and ordinances of Moses.

## Can I chose where my tithe goes?

> And all the tithe of the land, whether of the seed of the land, or of the fruit of the tree, *is the LORD'S: it is holy unto the LORD*.
{% ref 'Leviticus 27:30' %}

God has claimed the tithe as His own, reserving it for the work of ministry (<a>Malachi 3:10</a>), and He has called it holy, so the decision to use it for another purpose, such as charitable giving, is not for us to make.

## How should I support other worthy causes?

> Give unto the LORD the glory due unto his name: *bring an offering*, and come into his courts.
{% ref 'Psalm 96:8' %}

> Every man according *as he purposeth in his heart, so let him give; not grudgingly, or of necessity*: for God loveth a cheerful giver.
{% ref '2 Corinthians 9:7' %}

> Every man shall give *as he is able, according to the blessing of the LORD* thy God which he hath given thee.
{% ref 'Deuteronomy 16:17' %}

The Bible does make provision for the use of voluntary offerings for other worthy causes, which are given according to the discretion of the giver; however, it’s important to note that God does not want us to give grudgingly, but only if it comes from a cheerful, willing heart.

## How important is faithfulness in returning tithe?

> *Will a man rob God? Yet ye have robbed me. But ye say, Wherein have we robbed thee? In tithes and offerings*. Ye are cursed with a curse: for ye have robbed me, even this whole nation. Bring ye all the tithes into the storehouse, that there may be meat in mine house, and prove me now herewith, saith the LORD of hosts, if I will not open you the windows of heaven, and pour you out a blessing, that there shall not be room enough to receive it. And I will rebuke the devourer for your sakes, and he shall not destroy the fruits of your ground; neither shall your vine cast her fruit before the time in the field, saith the LORD of hosts.
{% ref 'Malachi 3:8-11' %}

Because the tithe belongs to the Lord, the Bible says that neglecting to return it is robbery of God, which is a violation of the eight commandment (<a>Exodus 20:15</a>): “Thou shalt not steal.” Ultimately, it’s not our money that God is after, but our heart, and a willingness to obey Him, out of love, in all things, is evidence of a heart that is surrendered. Moreover, Malachi teaches that it’s not really possible to outgive God because His generosity exceeds our ability to receive (<a>Malachi 3:10</a>), and it’s this generosity that He wants to develop in our own lives. He wants us to share in the blessing of giving&mdash;to realize that “it is more blessed to give than to receive” (<a>Acts 20:35</a>). Ultimately, though, His greatest desire is for us to enter into a trusting relationship with Him.

It’s also important to note that the promise of God’s blessing on those who faithfully tithe does not guarantee protection from hardship because we still live in a world of sin, nor does it guarantee financial prosperity because God is the one who chooses the type of blessing. While He can and does bless His people financially, there are other forms of blessing too, such as good health, peace of mind, protection, wisdom, good family relations, solid friendships, old things lasting longer, and others.

The Bible says the poor will always be with us (<a>John 12:8</a>), so just as financial prosperity is not necessarily a sign of God’s blessing, a lack of it is not a sign of His disapproval. We can rest assured that our heavenly Father is acquainted with all of our needs, and He will give us the right blessing at the right time (<a>1 Peter 5:7</a>).

## How can I be sure I’m tithing for the right reason?

> If ye *love me*, keep my commandments.
{% ref 'John 14:15' %}

> But God be thanked, that ye were the servants of sin, but *ye have obeyed from the heart* that form of doctrine which was delivered you.
{% ref 'Romans 6:17' %}

Obedience with tithing, as with the Ten Commandments, is not a form righteousness by works because the Bible is clear that we are saved by faith only (<a>Ephesians 2:8, 9</a>). We obey not to <i>be</i> saved but because we <i>are</i> saved by the grace and mercy of God that is freely available to all. When His love for us awakens a love for Him then it is only natural to want to please the person we genuinely love. Of course, this desire and ability to obey God comes only through the work of the Holy Spirit upon the heart, which Paul so eloquently explains in <a>Romans 8:4-9</a>. Such obedience can only be righteousness by faith because it is not our own, but it is evidence that love for God reigns supreme in the heart.

## Could the tithing system be abused?

> Then saith one of his disciples, Judas Iscariot, Simon's son, which should betray him, Why was not this ointment sold for three hundred pence, and given to the poor? This he said, *not that he cared for the poor; but because he was a thief, and had the bag, and bare what was put therein*.
{% ref 'John 12:4-6' %}

Where there are people there will be room for dishonesty, but human weakness is not an excuse for us not to be faithful to God. After all, Judas, one of Christ’s own disciples, was a thief. Remember, Christ commended the poor widow who gave all that she had to a church whose leaders would later crucify Him (<a>Mark 12:41-44</a>), but He still honored her because she gave out of love and faithfulness to Him (<a>Hebrews 7:8</a>). Our part is to be faithful to God, but once the money leaves our hands, it becomes His responsibility to deal with any potential misuse of His funds.

## What promises does God give us?

> There is that scattereth, and yet increaseth; and there is that withholdeth more than is meet, but it tendeth to poverty. The *liberal soul shall be made fat: and he that watereth shall be watered also himself*.
{% ref 'Proverbs 11:24,25' %}

> Honour the LORD with thy substance, and with the firstfruits of all thine increase: so shall *thy barns be filled with plenty, and thy presses shall burst out with new wine*.
{% ref 'Proverbs 3:9,10' %}

## What advice does Jesus give regarding life priorities?

> *Lay not up for yourselves treasures upon earth*, where moth and rust doth corrupt, and where thieves break through and steal: *but lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven*, where neither moth nor rust doth corrupt, and where thieves do not break through nor steal: for *where your treasure is, there will your heart be also*.
{% ref 'Matthew 6:19-21' %}

> But *seek ye first the kingdom of God, and his righteousness*; and all these things shall be added unto you.
{% ref 'Matthew 6:33' %}

> If ye know these things, *happy are ye if ye do them*.
{% ref 'John 13:17' %}

Jesus invites us to store treasure in heaven, not on earth, because our hearts are tightly linked with our investments. The heart focused on accumulating more and more money becomes greedy and covetous, but if the focus is on sharing the good news of Jesus then it becomes generous, loving, and joyful. Many people make the things of the world their first priority, and they <i>still</i> worry about their future, but Jesus asks His followers to do the opposite&mdash;to seek first His kingdom and His righteousness, and the promise is He will take care of everything else. So let’s trust Him fully and seek His will in everything we do (<a>Proverbs 3:5, 6</a>), including how we use our time and talents, because, in the end, His ways are always higher than our own (<a>Isaiah 55:8, 9</a>).
