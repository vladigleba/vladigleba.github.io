## Is the Holy Spirit part of the Godhead?

> Go ye therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and *of the Holy Ghost*: teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you: and, lo, I am with you alway, even unto the end of the world. Amen.
{% ct 'Matthew 28:19-20' %}

> The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the *communion of the Holy Ghost*, be with you all.
{% ct '2 Corinthians 13:14' %}

The Holy Spirit is part of the Godhead, also referred to as the Trinity, that consists of three distinct Persons: the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. These three Persons are united in perfect harmony as one God {% rf 'Isaiah 46:9' %}. In the Old Testament there are multiple instances where this unity in plurality is shown {% rf 'Genesis 1:26; 3:22; 11:7; Isaiah 6:8' %}. Another example is Jesus’ baptism, when all three members of the Godhead were present: the Son of God was baptized, the Father spoke, and the Holy Spirit descended {% rf 'Matthew 3:16-17' %}.

## Is the Holy Spirit a person?

> But Peter said, Ananias, why hath Satan filled thine heart *to lie to the Holy Ghost*, and to keep back part of the price of the land? Whiles it remained, was it not thine own? and after it was sold, was it not in thine own power? why hast thou conceived this thing in thine heart? *thou hast not lied unto men, but unto God*.
{% ct 'Acts 5:3-4' %}

> Howbeit *when he, the Spirit* of truth, is come, he will guide you into all truth: for he shall not speak of himself; but whatsoever he shall hear, that shall he speak: and he will shew you things to come.
{% ct 'John 16:13' %}

> And he that searcheth the hearts knoweth what is the *mind of the Spirit*, because he maketh intercession for the saints according to the will of God.
{% ct 'Romans 8:27' %}

Peter made it clear that the Holy Spirit is not only God, but He can also be lied to, which means He’s a Person with a personality, not an impersonal “force.” Paul confirmed this when he stated that the Spirit has a mind. Jesus, also, referred to the Spirit as “He”—an individual Being who works in harmony with the Godhead.

## What did Jesus promise before His ascension?

> Nevertheless I tell you the truth; It is expedient for you that I go away: for if I go not away, the Comforter will not come unto you; but if I depart, *I will send him unto you*.
{% ct 'John 16:7' %}

> And I will pray the Father, and *he shall give you another Comforter, that he may abide with you for ever*. Even the Spirit of truth; whom the world cannot receive, because it seeth him not, neither knoweth him: but ye know him; for *he dwelleth with you, and shall be in you. I will not leave you comfortless: I will come to you*.
{% ct 'John 14:16-17' %}

> And he that keepeth his commandments dwelleth in him, and he in him. And hereby we know that he abideth in us, *by the Spirit which he hath given us*.
{% ct '1 John 3:24' %}

Jesus promised that after His ascension He would send us the Comforter, the Holy Spirit, who’s abiding presence would comfort us. Notice also that when Jesus said the Holy Spirit would dwell in us, He followed that up with “I will come to you,” meaning Jesus equates the presence of the Spirit with His own presence! He Himself lives and abides in us through the Holy Spirit. When Jesus was on earth, people wanting to be with Him had to physically seek Him out, but we no longer have these limitations! Jesus can be anywhere and with anyone through the Person of the Holy Spirit.

## What is the Holy Spirit’s role?

> Howbeit when he, the Spirit of truth, is come, *he will guide you into all truth*: for he shall not speak of himself; but whatsoever he shall hear, that shall he speak: and he will shew you things to come. He shall glorify me: for he shall receive of mine, and shall shew it unto you.
{% ct 'John 16:13-14' %}

> But the Comforter, which is the Holy Ghost, whom the Father will send in my name, *he shall teach you all things*, and bring all things to your remembrance, whatsoever I have said unto you.
{% ct 'John 14:26' %}

> Now we have received, not the spirit of the world, but the spirit which is of God; *that we might know the things that are freely given to us of God*. Which things also we speak, not in the words which man’s wisdom teacheth, but which the Holy Ghost teacheth; comparing spiritual things with spiritual. But *the natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God: for they are foolishness unto him: neither can he know them, because they are spiritually discerned*.
{% ct '1 Corinthians 2:12-14' %}

Paul tells us that spiritual things are spiritually discerned {% rf '1 Corinthians 2:14' %}, so one of the roles of the Holy Spirit is to teach and guide those studying the Bible into an understanding of its beautiful, freely given, truths because the Bible was written under the inspiration of the Spirit {% rf '2 Timothy 3:16; 2 Peter 1:21' %}. Without the aid of the Spirit, the Bible cannot be understood, which is why it’s crucial to pray for the Holy Spirit’s guidance whenever we read it. Notice also that John says the Spirit does not speak independently of Jesus; on the contrary, He’s in harmony with the teachings of Jesus, working to give us an understanding of them.

## What else does the Spirit do?

> And when he is come, he will *reprove the world of sin, and of righteousness, and of judgment*.
{% ct 'John 16:8' %}

> But when the Comforter is come, whom I will send unto you from the Father, even the Spirit of truth, which proceedeth from the Father, *he shall testify of me*.
{% ct 'John 15:26' %}

> Likewise the Spirit also *helpeth our infirmities: for we know not what we should pray for as we ought: but the Spirit itself maketh intercession for us* with groanings which cannot be uttered. And he that searcheth the hearts knoweth what is the mind of the Spirit, because he maketh intercession for the saints according to the will of God.
{% ct 'Romans 8:26-27' %}

The Holy Spirit reproves, or brings conviction, of sin, of righteousness, and of judgment. In other words, He identifies what is right and wrong in the sight of God, enabling us to experience spiritual growth and an increased love of God, His righteousness, and holy living. Put simply, the Holy Spirit is the catalyst that brings power, victory, and life to the Christian walk. These life changes might seem impossible to us, but, if we are willing to cooperate with the Holy Spirit, nothing is impossible to God {% rf 'Mark 10:26-27; Philippians 2:13' %}.

The Holy Spirit also testifies of Jesus, revealing His character and truth to us, which, if received, has the power to sanctify our own characters {% rf 'John 14:6; 17:17' %}. And whenever we pray, it’s the Holy Spirit who inspires our petitions, if we let Him, so that they are in accordance to God’s will.

## To what extent do I need the Spirit?

> And be not drunk with wine, wherein is excess; but *be filled with the Spirit*.
{% ct 'Ephesians 5:18' %}

> For John truly baptized with water; but ye shall *be baptized with the Holy Ghost* not many days hence.
{% ct 'Acts 1:5' %}

God wants us to be filled, or baptized, with the Holy Spirit. The word “filled” can be translated as “to fill up,” indicating that it’s not just a partial filling.

## How do I receive the Holy Spirit?

> If ye then, being evil, know how to give good gifts unto your children: how much more shall your heavenly Father *give the Holy Spirit to them that ask him*?
{% ct 'Luke 11:13' %}

> *Let this mind be in you*, which was also in Christ Jesus.
{% ct 'Philippians 2:5' %}

All I need to do to receive the Holy Spirit is ask God for it! He wants to bestow the Holy Spirit on all, but He will not do it against anyone’s will, which is why I need to ask. Asking only comes after there’s been a realization of my need of the Spirit, which means there is a heart that’s surrendered to God, dead to self, willing to receive. Paul uses the word “let” to describe the process of receiving the mind of Christ, meaning there is a willingness to yield—to surrender—to the sanctifying work of the Holy Spirit. And it truly is His work, not ours, because we cannot change ourselves, but we must be willing to cooperate with Him.

## What happens when one is filled with the Spirit?

> But the *fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, longsuffering, gentleness, goodness, faith, meekness, temperance*: against such there is no law. And they that are Christ’s have *crucified the flesh with the affections and lusts*. If we live in the Spirit, let us also walk in the Spirit. Let us not be desirous of vain glory, provoking one another, envying one another.
{% ct 'Galatians 5:22-26' %}

> This I say then, Walk in the Spirit, and ye shall *not fulfil the lust of the flesh*.
{% ct 'Galatians 5:16' %}

A life that is filled with the Holy Spirit will produce the fruits of the Spirit, which are the attributes of Jesus, while the carnal, selfish nature will be crucified, or surrendered, to Christ. Notice that these are the fruits of the Spirit, not our own fruits, because we cannot produce them ourselves.

## What does the Spirit have the power to do?

> And the earth was without form, and void; and darkness was upon the face of the deep. And the *Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters*.
{% ct 'Genesis 1:2' %}

> *A new heart also will I give you, and a new spirit will I put within you*: and I will take away the stony heart out of your flesh, and I will give you an heart of flesh. And *I will put my spirit within you, and cause you to walk in my statutes, and ye shall keep my judgments, and do them*.
{% ct 'Ezekiel 36:26-27' %}

> Not by works of righteousness which we have done, but according to his mercy he saved us, *by the washing of regeneration, and renewing of the Holy Ghost*; which he shed on us abundantly through Jesus Christ our Saviour.
{% ct 'Titus 3:5-6' %}

> Jesus answered, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, *Except a man be born of water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God*. That which is born of the flesh is flesh; and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit. Marvel not that I said unto thee, Ye must be born again. The wind bloweth where it listeth [wishes], and thou hearest the sound thereof, but canst not tell whence it cometh, and whither it goeth: so is every one that is born of the Spirit.
{% ct 'John 3:5-8' %}

Just like the Holy Spirit participated in the work of creation on that first week, He participates in the work of recreating the heart, renewing the mind, and transforming the character after the likeness of Jesus. When the Holy Spirit dwells in us, He will give us a new heart, enabling us to keep God’s commandments and live a genuine, victorious, joyful Christian life. This transplant of the heart is what Jesus referred to when He told Nicodemus that no one can enter the kingdom of God unless born of the Spirit. Like the movement of the wind, the work of the Holy Spirit upon the heart is a mystery to us, but just like the movement of the wind is made evident by its sound, the work of the Spirit will be made evident by its fruits in a person’s life.

## What is the baptism of the Holy Spirit?

> For John truly baptized with water; but y*e shall be baptized with the Holy Ghost* not many days hence.
{% ct 'Acts 1:5' %}

> And when the day of Pentecost was fully come, they were all with one accord in one place. And suddenly there came a sound from heaven as of a rushing mighty wind, and it filled all the house where they were sitting. And there appeared unto them cloven tongues like as of fire, and it sat upon each of them. *And they were all filled with the Holy Ghost*, and began to speak with other tongues, as the Spirit gave them utterance.
{% ct 'Acts 2:1-4' %}

> Then Peter said unto them, Repent, and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins, *and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost*.
{% ct 'Acts 2:38' %}

Jesus’ promise to send the Holy Spirit was fulfilled on the Day of Pentecost when the disciples were filled, or baptized, with the Spirit, receiving various supernatural gifts that enabled them to proclaim the gospel with power. Peter made it clear that God’s genuine followers today are also prepared for service through the same outpouring of the Holy Spirit {% rf 'Ephesians 4:11-13' %} when they repent and [are baptized](/posts/basics/baptism.md). And just like the outpouring during Pentecost, there will be another outpouring of the Spirit in the last days, just before Christ’s return, that will enable God’s followers to preach the gospel with power and give the final warning to the world {% rf 'Acts 3:19-21; Joel 2:28-29' %}.

## Will the Spirit participate in the resurrection?

> But if the Spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you, *he that raised up Christ from the dead shall also quicken your mortal bodies by his Spirit that dwelleth in you*.
{% ct 'Romans 8:11' %}

The Holy Spirit will participate in the resurrection of God’s faithful followers, just like He participated in the resurrection of Christ. If we are Christ’s, there is no need to fear death because Jesus, who conquered death, will resurrect His people through the power of the Holy Spirit at His [second coming](/posts/prophecy/manner.md).

## What are the gifts of the Spirit?

> Now there are diversities of gifts, but the same Spirit. And there are differences of administrations, but the same Lord. And there are diversities of operations, but it is the same God which worketh all in all. But the manifestation of the Spirit is given to every man to profit withal.
>
> For to one is given by the Spirit the word of *wisdom*; to another the word of *knowledge* by the same Spirit; to another *faith* by the same Spirit; to another the gifts of *healing* by the same Spirit; to another the *working of miracles*; to another *prophecy*; to another *discerning of spirits*; to another *divers kinds of tongues*; to another the *interpretation of tongues*: but all these worketh that one and the selfsame Spirit, *dividing to every man severally [separately] as he will*.
{% ct '1 Corinthians 12:4-11' %}

> And he gave some, *apostles*; and some, *prophets*; and some, *evangelists*; and some, *pastors* and *teachers; for the perfecting of the saints, for the work of the ministry, for the edifying of the body of Christ*: till we all come in the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of God, unto a perfect man, unto the measure of the stature of the fulness of Christ.
{% ct 'Ephesians 4:11-13' %}

> Having then gifts differing according to the grace that is given to us, whether *prophecy*, let us prophesy according to the proportion of faith; or *ministry*, let us wait on our ministering: or he that *teacheth*, on teaching; or he that *exhorteth*, on exhortation: he that *giveth*, let him do it with simplicity; he that *ruleth*, with diligence; he that *sheweth mercy*, with cheerfulness.
{% ct 'Romans 12:6-8' %}

The Holy Spirit bestows various spiritual gifts on believers to edify the members of the church as well as to minister to those outside of the church. These can be obvious miraculous talents, but they also include already existing ones that the Spirit then develops. The Holy Spirit distributes these gifts as He wills, and every believer receives at least one.

## What does it mean to “speak in tongues”?

> And they were all filled with the Holy Ghost, and *began to speak with other tongues*, as the Spirit gave them utterance. And there were dwelling at Jerusalem Jews, devout men, *out of every nation under heaven*. Now when this was noised abroad, the multitude came together, and were confounded, because that *every man heard them speak in his own language*.
>
> And they were all amazed and marvelled, saying one to another, Behold, are not all these which speak Galilaeans? And *how hear we every man in our own tongue, wherein we were born*? Parthians, and Medes, and Elamites, and the dwellers in Mesopotamia, and in Judaea, and Cappadocia, in Pontus, and Asia, Phrygia, and Pamphylia, in Egypt, and in the parts of Libya about Cyrene, and strangers of Rome, Jews and proselytes, Cretes and Arabians, we do hear them speak in our tongues the wonderful works of God.
{% ct 'Acts 2:4-11' %}

> So likewise ye, except ye *utter by the tongue words easy to be understood*, how shall it be known what is spoken? for ye shall speak into the air. … Yet in the church I had rather speak five words with my understanding, that by my voice I might teach others also, *than ten thousand words in an unknown tongue*. …
>
> If any man speak in an unknown tongue, let it be by two, or at the most by three, and that by course; and *let one interpret*. But *if there be no interpreter, let him keep silence in the church*; and let him speak to himself, and to God. Let the prophets speak two or three, and let the other judge. If any thing be revealed to another that sitteth by, let the first hold his peace. For ye may all prophesy one by one, that all may learn, and all may be comforted. And the spirits of the prophets are subject to the prophets. *For God is not the author of confusion*, but of peace, as in all churches of the saints.
{% ct '1 Corinthians 14:9, 19, 27-33' %}

> *But ye shall receive power, after that the Holy Ghost is come upon you: and ye shall be witnesses unto me* both in Jerusalem, and in all Judaea, and in Samaria, and unto the uttermost part of the earth.
{% ct 'Acts 1:8' %}

Jesus said that the gifts and the filling of the Holy Spirit are for the purpose of witnessing to other people. This was examplified at Pentacost because one of the gifts of the Spirit was an ability to speak other tongues, or languages, and since there were people present in Jerusalem from other nations, the gift was needed so that the gospel could be communicated without any language barriers. The book of Acts mentions tongues only three times {% rf 'Acts 2:4-11; 10:44-46; 19:4-6' %}, and the Greek word for “tongues” in each of these three instances is the same word used for “tongues” in {% rf 'Revelation 14:6' false %}, which means real languages.

In 1 Corinthians Paul sheds more light on the subject. He emphasizes that tongues should be spoken that can be understood by those present, and if an unknown tongue is spoken, an interpreter should be used. He then concludes his remarks by making it clear that God is not the author of confusion. So speaking in tongues is a gift of the Spirit that gives a person the ability to speak another language, when that need is present, for the proclamation of the gospel.

## What warning is given regarding the Holy Spirit?

> And the LORD said, *My spirit shall not always strive with man*, for that he also is flesh: yet his days shall be an hundred and twenty years.
{% ct 'Genesis 6:3' %}

> And *grieve not the Holy Spirit of God*, whereby ye are sealed unto the day of redemption.
{% ct 'Ephesians 4:30' %}

Because the Holy Spirit is a Person, He can be grieved, and when this happens, He stops striving with us, meaning He stops convicting us of sin and of righteousness, no longer leading us to abandon the things that are offensive to God (sins of commission) or to do what is right in the sight of God, which can turn into sins of omission, if refused. Grieving away the Holy Spirit is a frightful position to be in because once He ceases to invite a person to come to Christ there is no hope of salvation left.

The Bible compares the Holy Spirit’s revelations of Bible truth with receiving light. As the Holy Spirit guides us into an understanding of Bible truth, and we choose to walk in that revealed light, God will continue giving us more light {% rf 'Proverbs 4:18-19' %}, but a persistent rejection of revealed truth can lead to the extinguishing of light, leaving us in the spiritual darkness of error {% rf 'John 12:35' %}. Paul describes this process as quenching the Spirit {% rf '1 Thessalonians 5:19' %}, similar to how water quenches fire.

In fact, Paul later warns that this quenching can lead to a delusion where error is accepted as truth {% rf '2 Thessalonians 2:10-12' %}, which leads to the experience described in {% rf 'Matthew 7:22-23' false %} where Jesus says “I never knew you” to those who thought they were saved but, actually, were lost because they had quenched the Spirit.

In {% rf 'Matthew 7:21' false %} Jesus says only those who do the will of His Father will enter the kingdom of heaven, so any teaching of “salvation in sin“ is not from God because it rejects the need of Jesus (as does “salvation by works“). A genuine acceptance of Jesus as Lord and Savior, that is motivated by love and gratitute, always leads to a changed lifestyle that is in harmony with His will, which is salvation *from* sin by faith in Jesus’ power to forgive, save, and transform {% rf '2 Corinthians 5:17; John 14:15' %}. Who choose to obey Him because we *are* saved, not *to be* saved.

## What is blasphemy against the Holy Spirit?

> Wherefore I say unto you, All manner of sin and blasphemy shall be forgiven unto men: but the *blasphemy against the Holy Ghost shall not be forgiven unto men*. And whosoever speaketh a word against the Son of man, it shall be forgiven him: but whosoever speaketh against the Holy Ghost, it shall not be forgiven him, neither in this world, neither in the world to come.
{% ct 'Matthew 12:31-32' %}

We’ve learned that one of the roles of the Holy Spirit is to convict us of sin, and the Bible makes it clear that any sin that is confessed will be forgiven by Jesus {% rf '1 John 1:9' %}. Blasphemy against the Holy Spirit, which cannot be forgiven, also known as the unpardonable sin, is a continual resisting or rejection of the Holy Spirit’s convicting, converting power, which leads to sins that are left unconfessed and, therefore, cannot be forgiven. This is why David, after committing the sin of adultery and murder, prayed that God would not take His Holy Spirit from him {% rf 'Psalm 51:11' %} because he knew that only the Spirit was able to lead him to repentance and a transformation of heart.

 God is patient, continuing to plead even with resistant people, but He won’t force Himself on anyone, and there will come a time when His pleading will cease {% rf 'Genesis 6:3' %}, if continually resisted. Each refusal to surrender to the Holy Spirit’s convictions creates a more hardened heart that is less sensitive to future conviction, and if this is continued, the Spirit will eventually depart, leaving that person to live with the cherished, uncofessed sin for good.

It’s unknown how long it takes to reach the point of no return, but one thing is certain: it’s never safe to say “no” to the Holy Spirit. The only wise thing to do is to surrender to the convictions of the Spirit by confessing and forsaking the sin being pointed out {% rf '1 John 1:9' %}. By the way, if you feel concerned you have rejected the Holy Spirit then that is evidence you have not.

## When should I act on the convictions of the Spirit?

> *I made haste, and delayed not* to keep thy commandments.
{% ct 'Psalm 119:60' %}

> For he saith, I have heard thee in a time accepted, and in the day of salvation have I succoured thee: behold, *now is the accepted time; behold, now is the day of salvation*.
{% ct '2 Corinthians 6:2' %}

> And now *why tarriest thou?* arise, and be baptized, and wash away thy sins, calling on the name of the Lord.
{% ct 'Acts 22:16' %}

Tomorrow is never guaranteed, so waiting to act on the pleadings of the Holy Spirit is never wise. Let’s not repeat the mistake Felix made when he chose to wait for a more convenient time to act {% rf 'Acts 24:25' %}, which never came. The good news is every time we choose to respond to the Holy Spirit’s convictions we yield to the power of the Spirit to change the mind and heart, and if we continue to cooperate with Him, He will transform our character to reflect the character of Jesus.

## Who does the Holy Spirit glorify?

> He shall *glorify me*: for he shall receive of mine, and shall shew it unto you.
{% ct 'John 16:14' %}

> *He that speaketh of himself seeketh his own glory*: but he that seeketh his glory that sent him, the same is true, and no unrighteousness is in him.
{% ct 'John 7:18' %}

Being Christ’s personal representative on earth, the Holy Spirit’s ministry is about drawing people to and glorifying Jesus, just as Christ’s ministry was about glorifying His Father {% rf 'John 17:4' %}. Those who have the genuine spiritual gifts of the Spirit will not seek to draw attention to themselves, their own teachings, or the things of the world; the focus will be on Jesus, His teachings, and His heavenly kingdom.

## What promises does the Bible give us?

> For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, *they are the sons of God*.
{% ct 'Romans 8:14' %}

> My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me: and I give unto them eternal life; and they shall never perish, *neither shall any man pluck them out of my hand*.
{% ct 'John 10:27-28' %}

As we commit our lives to Jesus and follow His Spirit’s leading, we become sons and daughters of God. His promise to us is He will keep us on course, leading us to His kingdom!
