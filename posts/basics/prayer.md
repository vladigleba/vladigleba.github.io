## Our loving Lord invites us to seek Him in prayer

Lk. 11:13 If ye then, being evil, know how to give good gifts unto your children: how much more shall your heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to them that ask him?

Mt. 7:11 If ye then, being evil, know how to give good gifts unto your children, how much more shall your Father which is in heaven give good things to them that ask him?

Ps. 65:2 O thou that hearest prayer, Unto thee shall all flesh come.

Mk. 11:23, 24 For verily I say unto you, That whosoever shall say unto this mountain, Be thou removed, and be thou cast into the sea; and shall not doubt in his heart, but shall believe that those things which he saith shall come to pass; he shall have whatsoever he saith. Therefore I say unto you, What things soever ye desire, when ye pray, believe that ye receive them, and ye shall have them. 

## Be sure your life is surrendered to His will. Be willing to surrender anything not in harmony with His will.

1 Jn. 5:14, 15 And this is the confidence that we have in him, that, if we ask any thing according to his will, he heareth us: And if we know that he hear us, whatsoever we ask, we know that we have the petitions that we desired of him.

Mt. 26:39 And he went a little further, and fell on his face, and prayed, saying, O my Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me: nevertheless not as I will, but as thou wilt.

Pr. 28:9 He that turneth away his ear from hearing the law, even his prayer shall be abomination.

1 Jn. 3:22 And whatsoever we ask, we receive of him, because we keep his commandments, and do those things that are pleasing in his sight. 

## Bring to Him everything that troubles you or concerns you in any way

1 Pet. 5:7 Casting all your care upon him; for he careth for you. 

Ps. 55:22 Cast thy burden upon the LORD, and he shall sustain thee: He shall never suffer the righteous to be moved.

## Mingle praise, gratitude, and thanksgiving with all of your prayers

Phil. 1:3, 4 I thank my God upon every remembrance of you, always in every prayer of mine for you all making request with joy.

Col. 3:15-17 And let the peace of God rule in your hearts, to the which also ye are called in one body; and be ye thankful. Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly in all wisdom; teaching and admonishing one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing with grace in your hearts to the Lord. And whatsoever ye do in word or deed, do all in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God and the Father by him.

1 Thess. 5:18 In every thing give thanks: for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus concerning you.

## The purpose of prayer is to lead us into oneness with the mind of God and the deepest fellowship with Him

Mt. 6:10 Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done in earth, as it is in heaven.

Rev. 3:20 Behold, I stand at the door, and knock: if any man hear my voice, and open the door, I will come in to him, and will sup with him, and he with me.

Eph. 3:16-19 That he would grant you, according to the riches of his glory, to be strengthened with might by his Spirit in the inner man; that Christ may dwell in your hearts by faith; that ye, being rooted and grounded in love, may be able to comprehend with all saints what is the breadth, and length, and depth, and height; and to know the love of Christ, which passeth knowledge, that ye might be filled with all the fulness of God. 

## God invites you to find a quiet place to pray and seek Him each day with your whole heart

Mt. 6:6 But thou, when thou prayest, enter into thy closet, and when thou hast shut thy door, pray to thy Father which is in secret; and thy Father which seeth in secret shall reward thee openly.

Mk. 1:35 And in the morning, rising up a great while before day, he went out, and departed into a solitary place, and there prayed.

Jer. 29:13 And ye shall seek me, and find me, when ye shall search for me with all your heart.

## Learn to pray aloud where only God can hear you

Jn. 11:41 Then they took away the stone from the place where the dead was laid. And Jesus lifted up his eyes, and said, Father, I thank thee that thou hast heard me. And I knew that thou hearest me always: but because of the people which stand by I said it, that they may believe that thou hast sent me.

Mt. 26:39 And he went a little further, and fell on his face, and prayed, saying, O my Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me: nevertheless not as I will, but as thou wilt.

Lk. 11:1 And it came to pass, that, as he was praying in a certain place, when he ceased, one of his disciples said unto him, Lord, teach us to pray, as John also taught his disciples.

## Record God's answers and rehearse his blessings

De. 8:2 And thou shalt remember all the way which the LORD thy God led thee these forty years in the wilderness, to humble thee, and to prove thee, to know what was in thine heart, whether thou wouldest keep his commandments, or no.

1 Ch. 16:12 Remember his marvellous works that he hath done, His wonders, and the judgments of his mouth.

## Spiritual formation, emptying the mind, repetition

Mt. 6:7, 8 But when ye pray, use not vain repetitions, as the heathen do: for they think that they shall be heard for their much speaking. Be not ye therefore like unto them: for your Father knoweth what things ye have need of, before ye ask him.
