## What is the primary motivator in a Christian’s life?

> But God commendeth his love toward us, in that, *while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us*.
{% ref 'Romans 5:8' %}

> We *love him*, because *he first loved us*.
{% ref '1 John 4:19' %}

Love for Christ is what moves a person to accept and follow Him. Without it, following Jesus turns into a burden.

## How is the Christian life and marriage similar?

> And whatsoever we ask, we receive of him, because we keep his commandments, and *do those things that are pleasing in his sight*.
{% ref '2 Corinthians 5:20' %}

Love for one’s spouse leads to a desire to please. That which is pleasing is practiced, and that which is displeasing is discontinued. The same is true in our relationship with Jesus. In His Word He outlines certain principles of conduct that please Him as well as those that displease Him, and a Christian who is filled with love for Jesus will find it a joy to do those things that make Him happy, while avoiding those that bring sorrow to His heart.

## What does pleasing God bring?

> If ye keep my commandments, ye shall abide in my love; even as I have kept my Father's commandments, and abide in his love. These things have I spoken unto you, *that my joy might remain in you, and that your joy might be full*.
{% ref 'John 15:10, 11' %}

> The thief cometh not, but for to steal, and to kill, and to destroy: I am come that *they might have life, and that they might have it more abundantly*.
{% ref 'John 10:10' %}

God has given us certain principles because, as our Creator, He knows what is best for us. The enemy tries to portray these principles as legalistic and dull, because he wants us to stay away from them, but the truth is following them brings fullness of joy into the life. They are for our own good (<a>Deuteronomy 6:24</a>), safeguarding us from the danger of sin (<a>Psalm 119:11</a>), while also giving us the opportunity to express our love for Christ as we follow His example (<a>John 14:15</a>).

## Do we have a responsibility as Christians?

> Now then *we are ambassadors for Christ*, as though God did beseech you by us: we pray you in Christ's stead, be ye reconciled to God.
{% ref '2 Corinthians 5:20' %}

> Now when they saw the boldness of Peter and John, and perceived that they were unlearned and ignorant men, they marvelled; and *they took knowledge of them, that they had been with Jesus*.
{% ref 'Acts 4:13' %}

> Go through, go through the gates; prepare ye the way of the people; cast up, cast up the highway; gather out the stones; *lift up a standard for the people*.
{% ref 'Isaiah 62:10' %}

Those who become followers of Christ become His ambassadors, representing Him wherever they go, whether in the family, at school, at work, or on vacation. Words and actions not only testify if the heart belongs to Christ, but they also have an influence on others. Jesus gave a solemn warning to Christians who are indifferent to their own example and influence (<a>Matthew 18:6</a>) as did Paul (<a>Romans 14:7, 13</a>). When people saw the conduct of Peter and John it was obvious to them that they were different because they had been with Jesus. May our walk with Christ transform us in like manner to reflect His character to those we come in contact with (<a>Matthew 5:16</a>).

## How should I deal with worldliness?

> *Love not the world, neither the things that are in the world. If any man love the world, the love of the Father is not in him*. For all that is in the world, the lust of the flesh, and the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life, is not of the Father, but is of the world. And the world passeth away, and the lust thereof: but he that doeth the will of God abideth for ever.
{% ref '1 John 2:15-17' %}

Every sin falls into one of three categories: 1) the lust of the flesh, 2) the lust of the eyes, or 3) the pride of life. These are the avenues through which Satan works to awaken in us a love for the world. Because we cannot serve two masters (<a>Matthew 6:24</a>), a love for the world decreases our love for God, whose principles are the exact opposite of those in the world, which is why James says that lovers of the world become enemies of God (<a>James 4:4</a>). We are called to be unspotted from the world (<a>James 1:27</a>) because the world, and its principles, will pass away, but the principles of God are eternal.

## What does Paul say about conformity?

> I beseech you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God, that ye present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God, which is your reasonable service. And *be not conformed to this world: but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind*, that ye may prove what is that good, and acceptable, and perfect, will of God.
{% ref 'Romans 12:1, 2' %}

Living in a world of sin brings pressure to conform to its ways, to be squeezed into its mold, but God’s goal is to transform us by renewing our minds through the truth of His Word (<a>John 17:17</a>).

## Why does transformation start with the mind?

> For *as he thinketh* in his heart, *so is he*.
{% ref 'Proverbs 23:7' %}

> But we all, with open face *beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord, are changed into the same image from glory to glory*, even as by the Spirit of the Lord.
{% ref '2 Corinthians 3:18' %}

Thoughts turn into words, which turn into actions, which turn into habits, which become a part of character. Satan knows that we become what we repeatedly behold, which is why he has a myriad of ways to influence our thoughts through our five senses, but especially sight and hearing. Because we become what we see and hear, we are invited to behold the glory of God’s character by daily reading His letter to us&mdash;the Bible&mdash;so that we may become more like Him.

## What guidance does God give regarding our thoughts?

> And the peace of God, which passeth all understanding, shall keep your hearts and minds through Christ Jesus. Finally, brethren, whatsoever things are *true*, whatsoever things are *honest*, whatsoever things are *just*, whatsoever things are *pure*, whatsoever things are *lovely*, whatsoever things are *of good report*; *if there be any virtue, and if there be any praise, think on these things*.
{% ref 'Philippians 4:7, 8' %}

> Casting down imaginations, and every high thing that exalteth itself against the knowledge of God, and *bringing into captivity every thought to the obedience of Christ*.
{% ref '2 Corinthians 10:5' %}

The list Paul provides on the kind of thoughts we are to think about has implications on what a Christian will choose to avoid:
- Dishonesty: lying, cheating, stealing, betrayal, or injustice.
- Impurity: profanity, pornography, fornication, adultery, homosexuality, and watching or listening to anything that’s debasing.

It’s unfortunate, but the lyrics of most secular songs glorify immoral behavior and numb our desire for spiritual things. Music is powerful because it bypasses the frontal lobe, the reasoning part of our brain, thereby appealing primarily to our emotions. It affects every function of the body, including pulse, breathing, and reflexes, but repetitive and syncopated rhythms, especially, alter mood and brain wave patterns, sending the listener into a type of hypnosis. At its best, music can be refreshing and uplifting, like it was to Saul when David played his harp (<a>1 Samuel 16:23</a>), but at its worst, it can be very degrading. Jesus wants to redeem us from the degradation of sin, and when we choose to follow Him, He will lead us to music that elevates, inspires, and refreshes. (For a deep dive into music, see the *Distraction Dilemma* seminar by Christian Berdahl.)

Besides music, there is a second avenue into our mind: the things we watch. Do the TV shows, movies, and internet videos we watch increase our love for Jesus or the world? Do they promote the principles of His kingdom or those of the world? It’s no secret that the majority of modern entertainment falls into the latter category, and it is having an affect on society. One study found that without television “there would be 10,000 fewer murders per year in the United States, 70,000 fewer rapes, and 700,000 fewer assaults.”[^1] Time is finite and precious, so instead of beholding these vices, Jesus invites us to behold Him through, and be blessed by, the reading and study of His Word (<a>Isaiah 45:22</a>).

[^1]: Newsweek, “Violence, Reel to Reel”, Dec. 11, 1995, p. 47.

## Is there a guide for choosing what to watch?

> Now the works of the flesh are manifest, which are these; *adultery, fornication, uncleanness, lasciviousness, idolatry, witchcraft, hatred, variance, emulations, wrath, strife, seditions, heresies, envyings, murders, drunkenness, revellings, and such like*: of the which I tell you before, as I have also told you in time past, that they which do such things shall not inherit the kingdom of God. But *the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, longsuffering, gentleness, goodness, faith, meekness, temperance*: against such there is no law. And they that are Christ's have crucified the flesh with the affections and lusts.
{% ref 'Galatians 5:19-24' %}

The above list makes it clear there is little in modern entertainment that is fit for a Christian to watch.

## What other guidance does the Bible give?

> The LORD trieth the righteous: but the wicked and *him that loveth violence his soul hateth*.
{% ref 'Psalm 11:5' %}

> *Turn away mine eyes from beholding vanity*; and quicken thou me in thy way.
{% ref 'Psalm 119:37' %}

> Let this *mind be in you, which was also in Christ Jesus*.
{% ref 'Philippians 2:5' %}

Instead of beholding vanity or violence, which are displeasing to God, we are invited to have the mind of Christ. It may seem like a high standard, but nothing is impossible to God (<a>Mark 10:27</a>). We can never accomplish it through our own power, but if we ask Him for it, He will give us a complete transformation of mind (<a>1 Corinthians 6:9-11</a>).

## Are we able to make our own judgments on what is right?

> *Ye shall not do* after all the things that we do here this day, *every man whatsoever is right in his own eyes*.
{% ref 'Deuteronomy 12:8' %}

> There is a way that seemeth right unto a man, *but the end thereof are the ways of death*.
{% ref 'Proverbs 16:25' %}

> The way of a fool is right in his own eyes: *but he that hearkeneth unto counsel is wise*.
{% ref 'Proverbs 12:15' %}

> *Be not wise in thine own eyes: fear the LORD, and depart from evil*. It shall be health to thy navel, and marrow to thy bones.
{% ref 'Proverbs 3:7, 8' %}

Sin has so perverted our sensibility to what is right and wrong that, without God drawing a clear distinction between the two in His Word, we are incapable of making the distinction ourselves. The key question He would like us to ask is will this music, movie, TV show, or book honor You?

## What principles does God give regarding clothing?

> In like manner also, that the women adorn themselves *in modest apparel, with propriety and moderation*, not with braided hair or gold or pearls or costly clothing, but, which is proper for women professing godliness, with good works.
{% ref '1 Timothy 2:9, 10, NKJV' %}

God’s counsel regarding clothing, which applies to both men and women, is modesty, propriety, and moderation. The key word is moderation, which means we are to avoid expensive clothes, but we are not to dress in sackcloth either. Our clothing should be clean, neat, and modest.

## What is a Christian’s true adornment?

> While they behold your chaste conversation coupled with fear. Whose adorning let it not be that outward adorning of plaiting the hair, and of wearing of gold, or of putting on of apparel; *but let it be the hidden man of the heart, in that which is not corruptible, even the ornament of a meek and quiet spirit, which is in the sight of God of great price*.
{% ref '1 Peter 3:2-4' %}

The ornaments God desires His people to wear are not outward ones; rather, it’s the adornment of the heart&mdash;possessing a character that reflects Jesus.

## What does God say about jewelry?

> Moreover the LORD saith, Because the daughters of Zion are haughty, and walk with stretched forth necks and wanton eyes, walking and mincing as they go, and making a tinkling with their feet. Therefore the Lord will smite with a scab the crown of the head of the daughters of Zion, and the LORD will discover their secret parts. *In that day the Lord will take away the bravery of their tinkling ornaments about their feet, and their cauls, and their round tires like the moon, the chains, and the bracelets, and the mufflers, the bonnets, and the ornaments of the legs, and the headbands, and the tablets, and the earrings, the rings, and nose jewels*, the changeable suits of apparel, and the mantles, and the wimples, and the crisping pins, the glasses, and the fine linen, and the hoods, and the vails. And it shall come to pass, that instead of sweet smell there shall be stink; and instead of a girdle a rent; and instead of well set hair baldness; and instead of a stomacher a girding of sackcloth; and burning instead of beauty.
{% ref 'Isaiah 3:16-24' %}

God clearly shows His displeasure when His people, referred to as daughters of Zion, adorn themselves on the outside and lack the adornment that truly matters&mdash;the adornment of character.

## What is jewelry associated with in the Bible?

> And I will visit upon her the days of Baalim, wherein she burned incense to them, and *she decked herself with her earrings and her jewels, and she went after her lovers, and forgat me*, saith the LORD.
{% ref 'Hosea 2:13' %}

> Then Jacob said unto his household, and to all that were with him, Put away the strange gods that are among you, and be clean, and change your garments: and let us arise, and go up to Bethel; and I will make there an altar unto God, who answered me in the day of my distress, and was with me in the way which I went. *And they gave unto Jacob all the strange gods which were in their hand, and all their earrings which were in their ears*; and Jacob hid them under the oak which was by Shechem.
{% ref 'Genesis 35:2-4' %}

> Unto a land flowing with milk and honey: for I will not go up in the midst of thee; for thou art a stiffnecked people: lest I consume thee in the way. And when the people heard these evil tidings, *they mourned: and no man did put on him his ornaments*. For the LORD had said unto Moses, Say unto the children of Israel, Ye are a stiffnecked people: I will come up into the midst of thee in a moment, and consume thee: therefore now put off thy ornaments from thee, that I may know what to do unto thee. *And the children of Israel stripped themselves of their ornaments by the mount Horeb*.
{% ref 'Exodus 33:3-6' %}

In the Bible jewelry is associated with idolatry, backsliding, apostasy, and forgetting God. By its very nature, jewelry draws attention to and exalts self, thus appealing to pride (<a>1 John 2:16</a>). The putting away of jewelry, on the other hand, is associated with repentance and turning back to God. For example, when Jacob chose to rededicate his life to God, he told his family to destroy their idols and to remove their jewelry. When the Israelites mourned their apostasy of worshiping the golden calf, God told them to put away their jewelry, and they did.

## How is the apostate church of Revelation portrayed?

> And there came one of the seven angels which had the seven vials, and talked with me, saying unto me, Come hither; I will shew unto thee the judgment of the great whore that sitteth upon many waters: with whom the kings of the earth have committed fornication, and the inhabitants of the earth have been made drunk with the wine of her fornication. So he carried me away in the spirit into the wilderness: and I saw a woman sit upon a scarlet coloured beast, full of names of blasphemy, having seven heads and ten horns. And the woman was arrayed in purple and scarlet colour, and *decked with gold and precious stones and pearls, having a golden cup in her hand full of abominations and filthiness of her fornication*: and upon her forehead was a name written, MYSTERY, BABYLON THE GREAT, THE MOTHER OF HARLOTS AND ABOMINATIONS OF THE EARTH.
{% ref 'Revelation 17:1-5' %}

> And he cried mightily with a strong voice, saying, *Babylon the great is fallen, is fallen, and is become the habitation of devils, and the hold of every foul spirit, and a cage of every unclean and hateful bird*. For all nations have drunk of the wine of the wrath of her fornication, and the kings of the earth have committed fornication with her, and the merchants of the earth are waxed rich through the abundance of her delicacies. And I heard another voice from heaven, saying, *Come out of her, my people, that ye be not partakers of her sins, and that ye receive not of her plagues*.
{% ref 'Revelation 18:2-4' %}

The apostate chuch of Revelation, having abandoned her loyalty to Jesus Christ, is shown as being decked with jewelry, which is in contrast to God’s true church of <a>Revelation 12:1</a> clothed with the sun, a symbol of Jesus’ righteousness (<a>Malachi 4:2</a>). God later calls His people to separate from Babylon and everything it stands for, including jewelry, pomp, and the exaltation of self. Instead, we are called to be clothed with the garments of salvation and Christ’s righteousness (<a>Isaiah 61:10</a>).

## Is obedience legalism?

> Know ye not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God? Be not deceived: neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor effeminate, nor abusers of themselves with mankind, nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor extortioners, shall inherit the kingdom of God. And *such were some of you: but ye are washed, but ye are sanctified, but ye are justified in the name of the Lord Jesus, and by the Spirit of our God*.
{% ref '1 Corinthians 6:9-11' %}

> Thou believest that there is one God; thou doest well: the devils also believe, and tremble. But wilt thou know, O vain man, that *faith without works is dead*? Was not Abraham our father justified by works, when he had offered Isaac his son upon the altar? Seest thou *how faith wrought with his works, and by works was faith made perfect*? And the scripture was fulfilled which saith, Abraham believed God, and it was imputed unto him for righteousness: and he was called the Friend of God. Ye see then how that by works a man is justified, and not by faith only.
{% ref 'James 2:19-24' %}

> Even so *every good tree bringeth forth good fruit; but a corrupt tree bringeth forth evil fruit*. A good tree cannot bring forth evil fruit, neither can a corrupt tree bring forth good fruit. Every tree that bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down, and cast into the fire. *Wherefore by their fruits ye shall know them*.
{% ref 'Matthew 7:17-20' %}

We obey Him <i>because</i> we are saved, not to <i>be</i> saved. The Bible is clear we are saved by God’s grace through faith (<a>Ephesians 2:8</a>), and because there is nothing we can do to be saved, when we accept His free gift of redemption from sin, we develop gratitude and love for Jesus that naturally makes us want to please Him, just as Jesus lived to please His Father in everything He did (<a>John 8:29</a>). For a person who genuinely loves Christ it’s a joy to discover His will in the Bible and to follow it in all areas of life. A conversion without a transformation of character or change in lifestyle, on the other hand, is most likely not genuine because faith without works is dead. A tree is known by its fruit, and genuine faith will produce a life that is obedient to Christ in an expression of love for Him.

## Will everyone understand the Christian lifestyle?

> But the natural man *receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God: for they are foolishness unto him*: neither can he know them, because they are *spiritually discerned*.
{% ref '1 Corinthians 2:14' %}

> For *they that are after the flesh do mind the things of the flesh; but they that are after the Spirit the things of the Spirit*. For to be carnally minded is death; but to be spiritually minded is life and peace. Because *the carnal mind is enmity against God: for it is not subject to the law of God, neither indeed can be*. So then they that are in the flesh cannot please God.
{% ref 'Romans 8:5-8' %}

The principles of Jesus are for those who are looking to be led by His Spirit. The world lacks spiritual discernment, so it will consider the things of God as foolishness. In fact, uncoverted people would be find heaven a bore because their love for worldy things could never be satisfied. This is why Jesus wants to change our tastes here on earth by calling us to be separate from the world (<a>2 Corinthians 6:17</a>) because the truth is we cannot serve two masters (<a>Matthew 6:24</a>).

Many try to follow Christ while staying as close as possible to the world, but a house divided against itself cannot stand (<a>Matthew 12:25</a>). Moreover, Jesus will never withhold from us anything that is good (<a>Psalm 84:11</a>) but only those things that are harmful. We may not always understand why He asks us to do certain things, but motivated by love, we can give Him the benefit of the doubt, trusting that He always has our best interest in mind.

## What if changing my habits feels overwhelming?

> And they were astonished out of measure, saying among themselves, Who then can be saved? And Jesus looking upon them saith, *With men it is impossible, but not with God: for with God all things are possible*.
{% ref 'Mark 10:26, 27' %}

> *Sanctify them through thy truth*: thy word is truth.
{% ref 'John 17:17' %}

Changing our tastes and habits is often overwhelming, and the truth is we cannot do it ourselves, but if we are <i>willing</i> to change and have faith in <i>God’s</i> power to do it, He <i>will</i> give us a love for the pure, holy, and righteous. What He needs from us is a willingness to separate from the things of the world and a desire to draw close to Him by spending more time with Him in His Word, through which He can then sanctify us (<a>John 17:17</a>). The more time we spend with Him, the more we will love Him, and the more we will want to please Him. Having our consent, He will then have the freedom to change us into His image (<a>2 Corinthians 3:18</a>), and people will take notice that we had been with Jesus (<a>Acts 4:13</a>).

## What does Jesus want for my life?

> *Ye are the light of the world*. A city that is set on an hill cannot be hid.
{% ref 'Matthew 5:14' %}

> *I will greatly rejoice in the LORD*, my soul shall be joyful in my God; for he hath clothed me with the *garments of salvation*, he hath covered me with the *robe of righteousness*, as a bridegroom decketh himself with ornaments, and as a bride adorneth herself with her jewels.
{% ref 'Isaiah 61:10' %}

> If ye know these things, *happy are ye if ye do them*.
{% ref 'John 13:17' %}

> *I delight to do thy will, O my God*: yea, thy law is within my heart.
{% ref 'Psalm 40:8' %}

Christ is looking for people who are willing to be fully surrendered to Him so that He can make them a light in a world that is only getting darker, people who are willing to be different, who want to be clothed with His garments of salvation and covered with His robe of rigtheousness. He is looking for a people who will rejoice in His redemption from, and victory over, sin in their lives, people who realize that true happiness, which is in such short supply in this world, comes from knowing and doing His will.
