## Does God like to reveal the future?

> Surely the Lord GOD will do nothing, but *he revealeth his secret* unto his servants the prophets.
{% ct 'Amos 3:7' %}

> For this is good and acceptable in the sight of God our Savior, *who desires all men to be saved and to come to the knowledge of the truth*.
{% ct '1 Timothy 2:3-4' %}

The beautiful thing about God’s character is that He does not just know the future, but He also likes to reveal it ahead of time to strengthen our faith in Him and prepare us for what is to come. He does not want anyone to be lost due to a lack of knowledge about eternal realities, and He often uses prophets to bring such things to the attention of His people. John, the revelator, is one such prophet to whom God has revealed events that will transpire near the close of earth’s history.

## What power is symbolized first in Revelation 13?

> And I stood upon the sand of the sea, and *saw a beast rise up out of the sea, having seven heads and ten horns, and upon his horns ten crowns, and upon his heads the name of blasphemy*. And the beast which I saw was like unto a leopard, and his feet were as the feet of a bear, and his mouth as the mouth of a lion: and the dragon gave him his power, and his seat, and great authority. And I saw one of his heads as it were wounded to death; and his deadly wound was healed: and all the world wondered after the beast. And they worshipped the dragon which gave power unto the beast: and they worshipped the beast, saying, Who is like unto the beast? who is able to make war with him? And there was given unto him a mouth speaking great things and blasphemies; and *power was given unto him to continue forty and two months*. And he opened his mouth in blasphemy against God, to blaspheme his name, and his tabernacle, and them that dwell in heaven.
>
> And it was given unto him to make war with the saints, and to overcome them: and power was given him over all kindreds, and tongues, and nations. And all that dwell upon the earth shall worship him, whose names are not written in the book of life of the Lamb slain from the foundation of the world. If any man have an ear, let him hear. He that leadeth into captivity shall go into captivity: he that killeth with the sword must be killed with the sword. Here is the patience and the faith of the saints.
{% ct 'Revelation 13:1-10' %}

As we already learned in a previous study, the beast that came out of the sea is the Roman papacy, which had influence and power in the world for 42 months. The papacy received a deadly wound at the end of this period in 1798 when the pope was taken captive by Napoleon’s General Berthier (see [“Mark of the Beast”](/posts/prophecy/mark.md)).

## What is the second power symbolized in Revelation 13?

> And I beheld another beast *coming up out of the earth*; and he had two horns like a lamb, and he spake as a dragon.
{% ct 'Revelation 13:11' %}

Verse 10 talked about the papal captivity that took place in 1798, and this second power is also seen emerging around that time. There is only one power that fits this time frame—the United States. It declared its independence in 1776, adopted the Constitution in 1787 and the Bill of Rights in 1791, and was recognized as a world power by 1798. An important detail mentioned in verse 11 is that it would arise “out of the earth,” as opposed to the sea. From {% rf 'Revelation 17:5' false %}, we know the sea represents areas of the world with large populations; therefore, the earth represents the opposite—an area that is sparsely populated. In other words, this second power could not arise out of the crowded nations of the Old World; it had to come out of a sparsely populated continent, which matches perfectly with the United States.

## How is it distinguished from other nations?

> And I beheld another beast coming up out of the earth; and he had *two horns like a lamb*, and he spake as a dragon.
{% ct 'Revelation 13:11' %}

Horns represent kings, kingdoms, or governments {% rf 'Daniel 7:24; 8:21' %}. In this case, they represent the two governing principles of the United States: civil and religious liberty. These principles have also been described as republicanism (a government without a king) and Protestantism (a church without a pope). Unlike other nations described in Daniel and Revelation, this one is distinguished by an absence of crowns, signifying a republican form of government, as opposed to a monarchy. Throughout history, it was also common for nations to tax people to support a state religion and oppress religious dissidents. The pilgrims on the Mayflower, as well as many other settlers that followed, were fleeing religious persecution, and so the United States was established with an entirely new mindset: the separation of church and state.

## Will the United States experience a change?

> And I beheld another beast coming up out of the earth; and he had two horns like a lamb, and he *spake as a dragon*.
{% ct 'Revelation 13:11' %}

We learn in {% rf 'Revelation 20:2' false %} that the dragon is Satan, who uses various earthly powers to persecute and destroy God’s people {% rf 'Revelation 12:13' %}. Since his rebellion in heaven, his aim has been to be like God—to usurp God and force people to worship him instead {% rf 'Isaiah 14:12-14' %}. So what does it mean for a nation to speak like a dragon? A nation “speaks” through its legislation, so to speak like a dragon means there will come a day when the United States, under the influence of Satan, will pass laws enforcing false worship.

## Does the Bible give more details?

> And he *exerciseth all the power of the first beast* before him, and *causeth the earth and them which dwell therein to worship the first beast*, whose deadly wound was healed. And he *doeth great wonders, so that he maketh fire come down from heaven on the earth* in the sight of men, and *deceiveth them that dwell on the earth by the means of those miracles* which he had power to do in the sight of the beast; saying to them that dwell on the earth, that they should make an image to the beast, which had the wound by a sword, and did live.
{% ct 'Revelation 13:12-14' %}

The United States will exercise all the power of the first beast, the papacy, meaning it will imitate it, becoming a persecuting power and forcing people to go against their conscience. The verse goes on to say that the United States will use its power to lead the other nations of the world in forcing allegiance to the papacy. The question of worship will be the central issue in the last days. Will it be my Creator and Redeemer, Jesus Christ, or the antichrist? Every person will make a decision to worship one or the other.

The call to align with the antichrist will appear genuinely spiritual and will be backed up by miracles, deceiving many, and those who refuse to go along will be made to appear divisive, stubborn, legalistic, and unpatriotic. All of this may seem shocking and outlandish, but Jesus does not lie and His words never fail {% rf 'Titus 1:2' %}. He tells us these things ahead of time, so that when they do come to pass, we may believe {% rf 'John 14:29' %}.

## Any other details?

> And deceiveth them that dwell on the earth by the means of those miracles which he had power to do in the sight of the beast; saying to them that dwell on the earth, that they should *make an image to the beast*, which had the wound by a sword, and did live.
{% ct 'Revelation 13:14' %}

The United States will make an image to the beast (imitate it) by legislating religious worship and forcing people to obey them or face imprisonment and, ultimately, death. This is a copy (an image) of the church-state form of government employed by the papacy during the Middle Ages, when millions were killed for their faith. The United States will abandon its principle regarding the separation of church and state and, instead, combine civil government and apostate Protestantism in an unholy union to use its influence and power to support the papacy. Protestant America will appear spiritual and trustworthy, but it will be satanic in its conduct—a lamb-like beast {% rf 'Revelation 13:11' %}. With the coming together of church and state, an image to the beast will have formed, and the United States will then influence all the other countries of the world to follow its example, culminating in the entire world making an image to the beast and worshiping it.

## What will this ultimately lead to?

> And he had power to give life unto the image of the beast, that the image of the beast should both speak, and *cause that as many as would not worship the image of the beast should be killed*. And he causeth all, both small and great, rich and poor, free and bond, to *receive a mark in their right hand, or in their foreheads*: and that *no man might buy or sell, save he that had the mark*, or the name of the beast, or the number of his name.
{% ct 'Revelation 13:15-17' %}

> And the dragon was wroth with the woman, and *went to make war with the remnant of her seed, which keep the commandments of God, and have the testimony of Jesus Christ*.
{% ct 'Revelation 12:17' %}

Worshiping and obeying the beast will result in receiving the mark of the beast through the keeping of Sunday as a false holy day (see [“Mark of the Beast”](/posts/prophecy/mark.md)), as opposed to worshiping and obeying Jesus and receiving His mark by keeping Saturday, the seventh-day Sabbath. Those who choose to worship the beast will have chosen to obey the word of a human being, as opposed to the word of their Creator, Jesus Christ. The papacy testifies to this itself: “The church changed Sabbath to Sunday and all the world bows down and worships upon that day in silent obedience to the mandates of the Catholic Church.”[^1]

As the leader of the international movement to force allegiance to the papacy, the United States will proceed to punish those who refuse to go along with its Sunday legislation by denying them the ability to buy or sell; eventually, it will impose a death sentence, which will become global. Despite all of this, the Bible promises that God will protect His people, and their food and water will be sure {% rf 'Isaiah 33:16; Psalm 34:7' %}.

## Has something similar happened in the past?

> Nebuchadnezzar the king *made an image of gold*, whose height was threescore cubits, and the breadth thereof six cubits: he set it up in the plain of Dura, in the province of Babylon.
{% ct 'Daniel 3:1' %}

> Then the princes, the governors, and captains, the judges, the treasurers, the counsellers, the sheriffs, and all the rulers of the provinces, were gathered together unto the dedication of the image that Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up; and they stood before the image that Nebuchadnezzar had set up. Then an herald cried aloud, *To you it is commanded, O people, nations, and languages*. That at what time ye hear the sound of the cornet, flute, harp, sackbut, psaltery, dulcimer, and all kinds of musick, ye *fall down and worship the golden image* that Nebuchadnezzar the king hath set up: and *whoso falleth not down and worshippeth shall the same hour be cast into the midst of a burning fiery furnace*. Therefore at that time, when all the people heard the sound of the cornet, flute, harp, sackbut, psaltery, and all kinds of musick, *all the people, the nations, and the languages, fell down and worshipped the golden image* that Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up.
{% ct 'Daniel 3:3-7' %}

> Nebuchadnezzar spake and said unto them, Is it true, O Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, *do not ye serve my gods, nor worship the golden image which I have set up*?
{% ct 'Daniel 3:14' %}

> If it be so, *our God whom we serve is able to deliver us from the burning fiery furnace*, and he will deliver us out of thine hand, O king. But if not, be it known unto thee, O king, that *we will not serve thy gods, nor worship the golden image which thou hast set up*.
{% ct 'Daniel 3:17-18' %}

A very similar scenario played out in Babylon during the reign of Nebuchadnezzar. It also involved a universal command forcing all to worship an image, along with the death penalty for those who refused. Most went along, but there was a small group of friends who refused to compromise by violating God’s commandments. Their love for God was stronger than death {% rf 'Revelation 12:11' %}, and they chose to remain faithful to Him by the grace of God.

## How influential is the papacy today?

The papacy has emerged to become the strongest religio-political power in the world. Almost every leading country has an official ambassador at the Vatican, including the United States. During Francis’ 2015 visit to the United States, President Obama personally welcomed the pope, and the White House said this was a symbol of the high level of respect America has for him.[^2] The visit also marked the first ever address by a pope to a joint session of Congress in American history. Besides the papacy’s political influence, its religious influence is also unparalleled, spanning  across the religious spectrum. For example, in 2014 Francis presided over an ecumenical worship service, attended by Orthodox, Anglican, Lutheran, Methodist, and other Christian representatives, at which he put out a call for Christian unity.[^3] According to Bible prophecy, the papacy’s influence will only increase as we approach the last days.

## How influential is the United States today?

The United States is regarded as the world’s center of influence. Even though it does face challenges to its power from countries such as China and Russia, it continues to dominate the world. “What ultimately makes the difference between war and peace ... is not good intentions, or strong words, or a grand coalition. It is the capability, credibility, and global reach of American hard power.”[^4] “The United States is and remains the one indispensable nation. That has been true for the century passed and it will be true for the century to come.”[^5] Bible prophecy is clear that the United States will continue to remain an influential world power in the last days.

## What can cause a worldwide religious law to be passed?

Some possibilities include: terrorism, civil unrest, crime, a major economic crash, epidemics, nuclear threats, political corruption, social inequality, injustice in the courts of law, escalating immorality and evil, major natural disasters. Such events could easily bring about a call for strong, specific laws to be enforced, and it’s not difficult to imagine a president of the United States using the country’s influence to promote such laws on a global scale in the guise of world peace and unity. But this unity will be based on compromise and error, not the truth. Those who refuse to compromise will be hated and labeled as fanatics, and eventually, in the interest of preserving peace and unity, destroying them will be considered as an act of service to God {% rf 'John 16:2' %} by those who become deluded through a persistent refusal to accept the truth {% rf '2 Thessalonians 2:10-12' %}.

## Will there be a false religious revival?

> And he *doeth great wonders, so that he maketh fire come down from heaven on the earth in the sight of men, and deceiveth them that dwell on the earth by the means of those miracles* which he had power to do in the sight of the beast; saying to them that dwell on the earth, that they should make an image to the beast, which had the wound by a sword, and did live.
{% ct 'Revelation 13:13-14' %}

> Then if any man shall say unto you, Lo, here is Christ, or there; believe it not. For there *shall arise false Christs, and false prophets, and shall shew great signs and wonders*; insomuch that, if it were possible, they shall deceive the very elect.
{% ct 'Matthew 24:23-24' %}

> And I saw three unclean spirits like frogs come out of the mouth of the dragon, and out of the mouth of the beast, and out of the mouth of the false prophet. For *they are the spirits of devils, working miracles*, which go forth unto the kings of the earth and of the whole world, to gather them to the battle of that great day of God Almighty.
{% ct 'Revelation 16:13-14' %}

With world conditions turning unbearable, a global movement of turning back to God, with all joining in worship on Sunday, will be presented as the only solution. The movement will be supported by signs, wonders, and miracles performed by the power of Satan, resulting in a counterfeit revival in which every person will be encouraged, and later, forced, to participate by keeping the papacy’s counterfeit “holy” day—Sunday, instead of God’s true and holy seventh-day Sabbath, instituted since the creation of the world.

These signs and wonders will be so convincing that Satan will attempt to deceive even God’s people. Fallen spirits (angels) of Satan will appear as dead loved ones {% rf 'Revelation 18:23' %}, probably even as Bible prophets and apostles, claiming they are sent of God to urge all to unite in cooperation, but really, in error, with the beast. The pressure to enforce Sunday legislation will be intense, and some, especially those who have no interest in religion, may comply merely for economic or social reasons, such as resting in support of climate change.

## What will be the crowning deception?

> For such are false apostles, deceitful workers, *transforming themselves into the apostles of Christ*. And no marvel; for *Satan himself is transformed into an angel of light*. Therefore it is no great thing if his ministers also be transformed as the ministers of righteousness; whose end shall be according to their works.
{% ct '2 Corinthians 11:13-15' %}

> Then if any man shall say unto you, Lo, here is Christ, or there; *believe it not*. For there *shall arise false Christs, and false prophets, and shall shew great signs and wonders*; insomuch that, if it were possible, they shall deceive the very elect.
{% ct 'Matthew 24:23-24' %}

> Ye are of your father the devil, and the lusts of your father ye will do. He was a murderer from the beginning, and abode not in the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he speaketh a lie, he speaketh of his own: for *he is a liar, and the father of it*.
{% ct 'John 8:44' %}

Satan himself will appear as an angel of light and claim to be Christ. He could also claim to have changed the Sabbath to Sunday and urge the world to move forward with honoring his counterfeit Sunday. The Bible says the deception will be effective and many will be deceived {% rf 'Revelation 13:3' %}, except God’s true followers who put everything to the test of Scripture {% rf 'Isaiah 8:19-20; 2 Timothy 2:15' %}. The Bible clearly says God’s law cannot change {% rf 'Luke 16:17; 21:33' %}, and Jesus will not touch the earth at His second coming but remain in the clouds to meet His people in the air {% rf '1 Thessalonians 4:16-17' %}.

## Will there be a genuine revival too?

> And I saw another angel fly in the midst of heaven, *having the everlasting gospel to preach unto them that dwell on the earth, and to every nation, and kindred, and tongue, and people*, saying with a loud voice, *Fear God, and give glory to him; for the hour of his judgment is come: and worship him that made* heaven, and earth, and the sea, and the fountains of waters.
>
> And there followed another angel, saying, *Babylon is fallen, is fallen*, that great city, because she made all nations drink of the wine of the wrath of her fornication.
>
> And the third angel followed them, saying with a loud voice, *If any man worship the beast and his image, and receive his mark in his forehead, or in his hand, the same shall drink of the wine of the wrath of God, which is poured out without mixture into the cup of his indignation*; and he shall be tormented with fire and brimstone in the presence of the holy angels, and in the presence of the Lamb: and the smoke of their torment ascendeth up for ever and ever: and they have no rest day nor night, who worship the beast and his image, and whosoever receiveth the mark of his name. Here is the patience of the saints: here are they that keep the commandments of God, and the faith of Jesus.
{% ct 'Revelation 14:6-12' %}

As Satan is working to deceive the world into believing that they must compromise with error by casting aside God’s Sabbath to keep a counterfeit day He never appointed, God will have a people who will give a powerful, three-point message to the entire world, symbolized by the three angels of Revelation 14, to unmask the deceptions of Satan so that every person alive will be well-informed regarding God’s Sabbath, and warned against receiving the beast’s mark, the counterfeit Sunday, because this decision will have eternal consequences.

Those who choose to obey and worship the beast through his man-made “holy” day will receive his mark and will cut themselves off from God’s love and mercy, and by extension, shut themselves out of His eternal kingdom. There will also be those who will join God’s side and choose to worship Him on His holy day, and Jesus’ sacrifice on the cross will cover their sins through faith and transform them into His obedient followers, sealing them for eternity {% rf 'Revelation 7:2-3' %}.

## Who is the false prophet of Revelation 16:13?

> And I saw three unclean spirits like frogs come out of the mouth of the dragon, and out of the mouth of the beast, and *out of the mouth of the false prophet*.
{% ct 'Revelation 16:13' %}

> And the beast was taken, and *with him the false prophet that wrought miracles before him, with which he deceived them that had received the mark of the beast*, and them that worshipped his image. These both were cast alive into a lake of fire burning with brimstone.
{% ct 'Revelation 19:20' %}

The false prophet works miracles before the beast to deceive those who end up receiving the beast’s mark and worshiping his image. This is a clear reference to the lamb-like beast of {% rf 'Revelation 13:11-18' false %} who appears spiritual and trustworthy, but ends up in an alliance with the papacy to persecute those who refuse to join the Sunday-keeping movement. The false prophet, therefore, represents Protestant America or, more specifically, apostate Protestantism, which also joins the Sunday-keeping alliance with the papacy. But their work of persecution will be interrupted by the second coming of Christ, who comes as a victorious King to rescue His persecuted followers {% rf 'Revelation 19:11-16' %}!

## Is this the battle of Armageddon?

> And the sixth angel poured out his vial upon the great river Euphrates; and the *water thereof was dried up, that the way of the kings of the east might be prepared*. And I saw three unclean spirits like frogs come out of the mouth of the dragon, and out of the mouth of the beast, and out of the mouth of the false prophet. For they are the spirits of devils, working miracles, *which go forth unto the kings of the earth and of the whole world, to gather them to the battle of that great day of God Almighty*. Behold, I come as a thief. Blessed is he that watcheth, and keepeth his garments, lest he walk naked, and they see his shame. And *he gathered them together into a place called in the Hebrew tongue Armageddon*.
{% ct 'Revelation 16:12-16' %}

> And I saw the beast, and the kings of the earth, and their armies, *gathered together to make war against him that sat on the horse, and against his army*.
{% ct 'Revelation 19:19' %}

> *These have one mind, and shall give their power and strength unto the beast. These shall make war with the Lamb, and the Lamb shall overcome them*: for he is Lord of lords, and King of kings: and they that are with him are called, and chosen, and faithful.
{% ct 'Revelation 17:12-14' %}

The battle of Armageddon is the final battle that’s fought on earth between Christ and Satan. It’s mentioned in the context of the beast and the false prophet, meaning it will be initiated by them, involving all the nations of the world in a united fight against Jesus and His people, with the goal of destroying all who refuse to worship the beast. But God will intervene.

The symbolic Euphrates river will dry up, meaning popular support of the beast will disappear {% rf 'Revelation 17:15' %}, prior to the coming of the “kings from the east,” which are the Father and His Son Jesus, a reference to the second coming {% rf 'Revelation 7:2; Ezekiel 43:2; Matthew 24:27' %}, when the people of God will be saved {% rf 'Revelation 16:17-21; 19:11-20' %}! The battle will resume after the 1,000 years, when Satan and his followers surround the New Jerusalem and try to capture it, but they will be destroyed by fire from heaven ({% rf 'Revelation 20:9' false %}; see “1,000 Years of Peace”), bringing the battle, and the great controversy between good and evil, to an end!

## How can I be safe from deception?

> To the law and to the testimony: *if they speak not according to this word, it is because there is no light in them*.
{% ct 'Isaiah 8:20' %}

> *If any man will do his will, he shall know of the doctrine*, whether it be of God, or whether I speak of myself.
{% ct 'John 7:17' %}

> I am the vine, ye are the branches: He that abideth in me, and I in him, the same bringeth forth much fruit: for *without me ye can do nothing*.
{% ct 'John 15:5' %}

Jesus will help me identify and avoid deception if I test every teaching by the Bible {% rf 'Psalm 119:104' %}, follow truth as He reveals it to me, and stay close to Him on a daily basis through prayer and the reading of His Good Book—the Bible. The battle is His, and it has already been won on a hill called Calvary where Christ died to pay for my sins. The only question is have I given Him my heart and joined His winning side?

## What promise does the Bible give?

> He that dwelleth in the secret place of the most High shall abide under the shadow of the Almighty. I will say of the LORD, *He is my refuge and my fortress: my God; in him will I trust*. Surely he shall deliver thee from the snare of the fowler, and from the noisome pestilence. He shall cover thee with his feathers, and under his wings shalt thou trust: *his truth shall be thy shield and buckler*. Thou shalt not be afraid for the terror by night; nor for the arrow that flieth by day; nor for the pestilence that walketh in darkness; nor for the destruction that wasteth at noonday. A thousand shall fall at thy side, and ten thousand at thy right hand; but it shall not come nigh thee. Only with thine eyes shalt thou behold and see the reward of the wicked.
>
> Because thou hast made the LORD, which is my refuge, even the most High, thy habitation; there shall no evil befall thee, neither shall any plague come nigh thy dwelling. *For he shall give his angels charge over thee, to keep thee in all thy ways*. They shall bear thee up in their hands, lest thou dash thy foot against a stone. Thou shalt tread upon the lion and adder: the young lion and the dragon shalt thou trample under feet. Because he hath set his love upon me, therefore will I deliver him: I will set him on high, because he hath known my name. *He shall call upon me, and I will answer him: I will be with him in trouble; I will deliver him*, and honour him. With long life will I satisfy him, and shew him my salvation.
{% ct 'Psalm 91' %}

God promises that His truth will be our shield from the arrows of deception, keeping us on the narrow path of righteousness that leads into His eternal kingdom.
