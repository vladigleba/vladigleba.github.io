## Is God open about the future?

> Surely the Lord GOD will do nothing, but *he revealeth his secret* unto his servants the prophets.
{% ct 'Amos 3:7' %}

> For this is good and acceptable in the sight of God our Savior, *who desires all men to be saved and to come to the knowledge of the truth*.
{% ct '1 Timothy 2:3-4' %}

The beautiful thing about God’s character is that He not only knows the future, but also chooses to reveal it in advance to strengthen our faith and prepare us for what is to come. He does not want anyone to be lost because of a lack of knowledge about eternal realities, so He often speaks through prophets to make these truths known to His people. John the Revelator is one such prophet, to whom God revealed events that will unfold near the close of earth’s history.

## What power is symbolized first in Revelation 13?

> And I stood upon the sand of the sea, and *saw a beast rise up out of the sea, having seven heads and ten horns, and upon his horns ten crowns, and upon his heads the name of blasphemy*. And the beast which I saw was like unto a leopard, and his feet were as the feet of a bear, and his mouth as the mouth of a lion: and the dragon gave him his power, and his seat, and great authority. And I saw one of his heads as it were wounded to death; and his deadly wound was healed: and all the world wondered after the beast. And they worshipped the dragon which gave power unto the beast: and they worshipped the beast, saying, Who is like unto the beast? who is able to make war with him? And there was given unto him a mouth speaking great things and blasphemies; and *power was given unto him to continue forty and two months*. And he opened his mouth in blasphemy against God, to blaspheme his name, and his tabernacle, and them that dwell in heaven.
>
> And it was given unto him to make war with the saints, and to overcome them: and power was given him over all kindreds, and tongues, and nations. And all that dwell upon the earth shall worship him, whose names are not written in the book of life of the Lamb slain from the foundation of the world. If any man have an ear, let him hear. He that leadeth into captivity shall go into captivity: he that killeth with the sword must be killed with the sword. Here is the patience and the faith of the saints.
{% ct 'Revelation 13:1-10' %}

As we learned in a previous study, the beast that rose from the sea represents the Roman papacy, which held influence and power over the world for 42 months. The papacy received a [deadly wound](/posts/prophecy/mark.md) at the end of this period in 1798, when Pope Pius VI was taken captive by Napoleon Bonaparte’s general, Louis-Alexandre Berthier.

By the way, the beast represented in {% rf 'Revelation 13:2' false %} is a conglomerate of the [four beasts](/posts/prophecy/antichrist.md) described in {% rf 'Daniel 7:2-8' false %}, because Catholicism has adopted the works-based religion of Babylon, the Persian system of government (based on the structure of Mithraism), the philosophy of Greece (for example, natural law and the elevation of reason), and the legal system of Rome (for example, canon law).

## What power is symbolized next?

> And I beheld another beast *coming up out of the earth*; and he had two horns like a lamb, and he spake as a dragon.
{% ct 'Revelation 13:11' %}

{% rf 'Revelation 13:10' false %} refers to the papal captivity that occurred in 1798, and the second beast is seen emerging around the same time. There is only one power that fits this time frame—the United States. It declared its independence in 1776, adopted the Constitution in 1787, and ratified the Bill of Rights in 1791. By 1798, it was recognized as a rising global power. A key detail in verse 11 is that this power arises “out of the earth,” in contrast to the first beast, which came “out of the sea.” According to {% rf 'Revelation 17:15' false %}, the sea symbolizes large, densely populated areas; therefore, the earth represents the opposite—a sparsely populated region. This means the second beast could not emerge from the crowded nations of the Old World; instead, it had to rise from a less populated part of the world—perfectly matching the emergence of the United States.

## What makes the U.S. unique?

> And I beheld another beast coming up out of the earth; and he had *two horns like a lamb*, and he spake as a dragon.
{% ct 'Revelation 13:11' %}

The lamb-like horns suggest youth and innocence, emphasizing that this would be a new nation. Horns, on the other hand, represent kings, kingdoms, or governing powers {% rf 'Daniel 7:24; 8:21' %}. In this case, they symbolize the two founding principles of the United States: civil and religious liberty. These principles have also been described as republicanism (a government without a king) and Protestantism (a church without a pope).[^1] Unlike other nations described in Daniel and Revelation, this one is distinguished by the absence of crowns, signifying a republican form of government as opposed to a monarchy. 

Throughout history, it was common for nations to tax citizens to support a state religion and to oppress religious dissenters. The Pilgrims on the Mayflower, along with many other settlers who followed, were fleeing religious persecution, and so the United States was founded with an entirely new mindset: the separation of church and state. This idea, first brought to prominence by the German princes at the Diet of Speyer in 1529, found its fullest expression more than 250 years later when, in 1791, the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution was adopted. Yet the princes were not its originators; they were merely echoing what Jesus had taught long before, when He declared, “Render to Caesar the things that are Caesar’s, and to God the things that are God’s” {% rf 'Mark 12:17' %}. In upholding liberty of conscience, Protestantism provided the world with a foundation upon which the future freedom, happiness, and well-being of society could be built.[^2]

[^1]: These two principles—civil and religious liberty—“are the secret of its [the United States'] power and prosperity. The oppressed and downtrodden throughout Christendom have turned to this land with interest and hope. Millions have sought its shores, and the United States has risen to a place among the most powerful nations of the earth.” Ellen G. White, *The Great Controversy*, p. 441

[^2]: Closely related to liberty of conscience is the authority of the Bible above that of the Church: “The principles contained in the celebrated Protest of the 19th of April, 1529, constitute the very essence of Protestantism. Now this Protest opposes two abuses of man in matters of faith: the first is the intrusion of the civil magistrate, and the second the arbitrary authority of the church. Instead of these abuses, Protestantism sets the power of conscience above the magistrate, and the authority of the word of God above the visible church. In the first place, it rejects the civil power in divine things, and says with the prophets and apostles, ‘We must obey God rather than man.’ In presence of the crown of Charles the Fifth, it uplifts the crown of Jesus Christ. But it goes farther: it lays down the principle that all human teaching should be subordinate to the oracles of God.” —Merle d’Aubigné, *History of the Reformation*, Book 13, Chapter 6, Paragraph 18.

## Will the U.S. experience a change?

> And I beheld another beast coming up out of the earth; and he had two horns like a lamb, and he *spake as a dragon*.
{% ct 'Revelation 13:11' %}

{% rf 'Revelation 20:2' false %} identifies the dragon as Satan, who uses various earthly powers to persecute and destroy God’s people {% rf 'Revelation 12:13' %}. Since his rebellion in heaven, Satan’s aim has been to be like God—to usurp His authority and compel people to worship him instead {% rf 'Isaiah 14:12-14' %}. So what does it mean for a nation to speak like a dragon? A nation “speaks” through its laws and legislative actions, so to speak like a dragon means that a time will come when the United States, under Satan’s influence, will enact laws enforcing false worship.

Not only will this be an abandonment of the nation’s duty to protect liberty of conscience for all its citizens—and thus a repudiation of the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution—but it will also be an act of blasphemy, for it will assume authority that belongs only to God. As our Creator, God alone has the authority to prescribe our duties to Him, and He has done so with the Ten Commandments. To enforce these duties by coercion, even if it is claimed to be for the good of society, creates a society of hypocrites who obey outwardly while the heart remains unconverted—the exact opposite of what God desires in His followers {% rf 'Deuteronomy 30:6; Ezekiel 36:26' %}. The use of coercion has no power to regenerate the heart, and it is utterly repugnant to the God of love who gave Adam and Eve the freedom to walk away from Him—at infinite cost to Himself.

## Does the Bible give more details?

> And he *exerciseth all the power of the first beast* before him, and *causeth the earth and them which dwell therein to worship the first beast*, whose deadly wound was healed. And he *doeth great wonders, so that he maketh fire come down from heaven on the earth* in the sight of men, and *deceiveth them that dwell on the earth by the means of those miracles* which he had power to do in the sight of the beast; saying to them that dwell on the earth, that they should make an image to the beast, which had the wound by a sword, and did live.
{% ct 'Revelation 13:12-14' %}

The United States will exercise all the authority of the first beast, the papacy, meaning it will imitate its actions, becoming a persecuting power that compels individuals to act against their conscience. The passage goes on to say that the United States will use its influence to lead other nations to do the same. Clearly, worship will be the central issue in the last days. Every individual will be faced with the question: *Will I worship my Creator and Redeemer, Jesus Christ, or the antichrist?*

The call to align with the antichrist will *appear* genuinely spiritual, being backed by miracles that will deceive many. Religious fanaticism will run high, causing those who refuse to comply to be labeled divisive, stubborn, legalistic, and unpatriotic. Though this may seem shocking and outlandish, Jesus does not lie, and His words never fail {% rf 'Titus 1:2' %}. He reveals these things ahead of time so that when they do come to pass, we may believe {% rf 'John 14:29' %}.

## Any other details?

> And deceiveth them that dwell on the earth by the means of those miracles which he had power to do in the sight of the beast; saying to them that dwell on the earth, that they should *make an image to the beast*, which had the wound by a sword, and did live. And he had power to give life unto the image of the beast, that the image of the beast should both speak, and cause that as many as would not worship the image of the beast should be killed.
{% ct 'Revelation 13:14-15' %}

Abandoning its foundational principle of church-state separation, the United States will instead form an unholy union between civil government and apostate Protestantism. In doing so, it will make an image to the beast by establishing a copy of the church-state system used by the papacy during the Middle Ages, when millions were killed for their faith. These actions will appear spiritual, patriotic, and beneficial to society, but they will be satanic in nature—fitly represented by the lamb-like beast {% rf 'Revelation 13:11' %}. With apostate Protestantism in control of the government, religious legislation will soon follow {% rf 'Revelation 13:15' %}. It will begin mildly but will eventually escalate, forcing people to comply or face persecution and, ultimately, death. Once this church-state union is formed domestically, the U.S. will pressure other nations to follow its example, leading the entire world to wonder after the beast {% rf 'Revelation 13:3' %}.

There are a couple of additional details worth noting. The deceptive miracle-working described above is a religious activity, which means it is carried out by the apostate Protestant side of the church-state union. These miracles then empower the deception, persuading those who dwell on the earth to make an image to the beast. Notably, the image is *made*, indicating that it did not exist originally, so this can only apply to a nation that had no church-state union at its founding. Moreover, it is the *people* dwelling on the earth who make an image to the beast. This suggests a representative form of government, one that is “of the people, by the people, and for the people.”[^3] In other words, it will be the people, urged on by the apostate Protestant churches, who will demand religious laws from their representatives in Congress.

## What will this ultimately lead to?

> And he had power to give life unto the image of the beast, that the image of the beast should both speak, and *cause that as many as would not worship the image of the beast should be killed*. And he causeth all, both small and great, rich and poor, free and bond, to *receive a mark in their right hand, or in their foreheads*: and that *no man might buy or sell, save he that had the mark*, or the name of the beast, or the number of his name.
{% ct 'Revelation 13:15-17' %}

> And the dragon was wroth with the woman, and *went to make war with the remnant of her seed, which keep the commandments of God, and have the testimony of Jesus Christ*.
{% ct 'Revelation 12:17' %}

Worshiping and obeying the beast will result in receiving the [mark of the beast](/posts/prophecy/mark.md) through the keeping of Sunday as a false holy day, as opposed to worshiping and obeying Jesus and receiving His mark by keeping the seventh-day Sabbath. Those who choose to worship the beast will have chosen to obey the word of a human being rather than the word of their Creator, Jesus Christ. The papacy testifies to this itself: “The church changed Sabbath to Sunday and all the world bows down and worships upon that day in silent obedience to the mandates of the Catholic Church.”[^4]

As the leader of the international movement to enforce allegiance to the papacy, the United States will proceed to punish those who refuse to comply with its Sunday legislation by denying them the ability to buy or sell. Eventually, it will impose a death sentence, which will become global. Despite all this, the Bible promises that God will protect His people, and their food and water will be sure {% rf 'Isaiah 33:16; Psalm 34:7' %}.

[^4]: *Hartford Weekly Call*, February 22, 1884.

## Has something similar happened in the past?

> Nebuchadnezzar the king *made an image of gold*, whose height was threescore cubits, and the breadth thereof six cubits: he set it up in the plain of Dura, in the province of Babylon.
{% ct 'Daniel 3:1' %}

> Then the princes, the governors, and captains, the judges, the treasurers, the counsellers, the sheriffs, and all the rulers of the provinces, were gathered together unto the dedication of the image that Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up; and they stood before the image that Nebuchadnezzar had set up. Then an herald cried aloud, *To you it is commanded, O people, nations, and languages*. That at what time ye hear the sound of the cornet, flute, harp, sackbut, psaltery, dulcimer, and all kinds of musick, ye *fall down and worship the golden image* that Nebuchadnezzar the king hath set up: and *whoso falleth not down and worshippeth shall the same hour be cast into the midst of a burning fiery furnace*. Therefore at that time, when all the people heard the sound of the cornet, flute, harp, sackbut, psaltery, and all kinds of musick, *all the people, the nations, and the languages, fell down and worshipped the golden image* that Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up.
{% ct 'Daniel 3:3-7' %}

> Nebuchadnezzar spake and said unto them, Is it true, O Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, *do not ye serve my gods, nor worship the golden image which I have set up*?
{% ct 'Daniel 3:14' %}

> If it be so, *our God whom we serve is able to deliver us from the burning fiery furnace*, and he will deliver us out of thine hand, O king. But if not, be it known unto thee, O king, that *we will not serve thy gods, nor worship the golden image which thou hast set up*.
{% ct 'Daniel 3:17-18' %}

A very similar scenario played out in Babylon during the reign of Nebuchadnezzar. It also involved a universal command forcing all to worship an image, with the death penalty for those who refused. Most complied, but a small group of friends refused to compromise by violating God’s commandments. Their love for God was stronger than death {% rf 'Revelation 12:11' %}, and they chose to remain faithful to Him by His grace.

## Has the U.S. passed religious legislation before?

In 1888, Senator Henry Blair proposed a bill that sought to establish Sunday as a national day of rest, which was fortunately defeated; nevertheless, a turning point came just four years later. In the landmark 1892 case *Church of the Holy Trinity v. United States*, the Supreme Court declared the United States a Christian nation, thereby setting a precedent that would justify future religious legislation. [^5] That same year, Congress passed legislation requiring the World’s Columbian Exposition to close on Sundays in honor of Sunday observance, a mandate endorsed by President Benjamin Harrison, who made government funding for the fair conditional on Sunday closure. As a result, only 101 years after the ratification of the First Amendment, which established the separation of church and state, all three branches of the United States government had effectively repudiated that principle. Today, many states already have “blue laws” that restrict commerce on Sundays, based on the Supreme Court’s 1961 ruling in *McGowan v. Maryland*, which held that such laws do not violate the First Amendment.

[^5]: This was done despite the 1797 Treaty of Tripoli—signed by President George Washington and approved by the U.S. Senate—which, in Article 11, declared that “the government of the United States is not in any sense founded upon the Christian religion.”

## How influential is the papacy?

The papacy has emerged as the most powerful religio-political entity in the world. Nearly every major country maintains an official ambassador to the Vatican, including the United States. During Pope Francis’ 2015 visit to the U.S., President Obama personally welcomed him, with the White House describing the event as a symbol of the high level of respect America holds for the pontiff.[^6] The visit also marked the first time in American history that a pope addressed a joint session of Congress.

In addition to its political influence, the papacy’s religious influence is likewise unparalleled, spanning  across the religious spectrum. For instance, in 2014, Francis presided over an ecumenical worship service attended by representatives from the Orthodox, Anglican, Lutheran, Methodist, and other Christian traditions, during which he called for greater Christian unity.[^7] Throughout his pontificate, Francis has consistently sought to build bridges with those outside the Christian faith as well. Such efforts have elevated the papacy’s global influence—an influence that, according to Bible prophecy, will continue to grow in the days to come.[^8]

[^6]: *Irish Daily Mail*, September 23, 2015.
[^7]: *Catholic Herald*, January 27, 2014.
[^8]: Of course, there is nothing inherently wrong with unity. After all, Jesus teaches us to love our neighbors—even our enemies—and He prayed for unity among His disciples {% rf 'Matthew 22:39; 5:44; John 17:11' %}. Unity is indeed biblical, so long as it is not built on the compromise of truth as revealed in God’s Word. Unfortunately, this is often [not the case](/posts/gospel/salvation.md#how-exactly-am-i-saved-from-my-sins).

## How influential is the U.S. today?

Few would dispute that the United States is a global leader and a fulcrum of influence. Although it faces challenges to its power from countries such as China and Russia, it continues to dominate the global stage. “What ultimately makes the difference between war and peace … is not good intentions, or strong words, or a grand coalition. It is the capability, credibility, and global reach of American hard power.”[^9] “The United States is and remains the one indispensable nation. That has been true for the century past, and it will be true for the century to come.”[^10] Contrary to the belief that the United States will lose its elevated standing and become merely one among several strong nations, Bible prophecy indicates that this simply cannot be. The United States will remain a leading world power until the Second Coming of Christ.

## What can cause a worldwide religious law to be passed?

Potential catalysts for global upheaval include terrorism, civil unrest, crime, a major economic collapse, epidemics, nuclear threats, political corruption, social inequality, judicial injustice, escalating immorality, and catastrophic natural disasters. Such crises could readily lead to calls for the enactment of drastic, previously unthinkable legislation in the United States—laws that could then be promoted globally under the banner of world peace and unity. However, this unity will likely be built on compromise and deception rather than on truth, and those who refuse to conform will likely be scorned and labeled as fanatics—as often happens in times of crisis when groupthink prevails. Ultimately, in the name of preserving peace and unity, eliminating such individuals will be considered a service to God, as foretold in {% rf 'John 16:2' false %}, by those who have become deluded through their persistent rejection of the truth {% rf '2 Thessalonians 2:10-12' %}.

## Will there be a false religious revival?

> And he *doeth great wonders, so that he maketh fire come down from heaven on the earth in the sight of men, and deceiveth them that dwell on the earth by the means of those miracles* which he had power to do in the sight of the beast; saying to them that dwell on the earth, that they should make an image to the beast, which had the wound by a sword, and did live.
{% ct 'Revelation 13:13-14' %}

> Then if any man shall say unto you, Lo, here is Christ, or there; believe it not. For there *shall arise false Christs, and false prophets, and shall shew great signs and wonders*; insomuch that, if it were possible, they shall deceive the very elect.
{% ct 'Matthew 24:23-24' %}

> And I saw three unclean spirits like frogs come out of the mouth of the dragon, and out of the mouth of the beast, and out of the mouth of the false prophet. For *they are the spirits of devils, working miracles*, which go forth unto the kings of the earth and of the whole world, to gather them to the battle of that great day of God Almighty.
{% ct 'Revelation 16:13-14' %}

As global conditions become increasingly unbearable, a worldwide movement calling for a return to God—centered on synchronized, family-focused, and environmentally conscious Sunday observance—will be promoted as the only solution. This movement will be accompanied by signs, wonders, and miracles performed through the power of Satan, resulting in a counterfeit revival in which every person will be urged—and eventually compelled—to participate by honoring the papacy’s counterfeit “holy” day in place of God’s true and holy seventh-day Sabbath, instituted at Creation.[^11]

These signs and wonders will be so convincing that Satan will attempt to deceive even God’s own people. Fallen spirits (angels of Satan) could appear as deceased loved ones {% rf 'Revelation 18:23' %}, and possibly even as Bible prophets or apostles, claiming to be sent by God to promote unity and peace. The pressure to enforce Sunday legislation will be intense, and some—especially those indifferent to religion—may comply simply for economic, social, or even environmental reasons.

[^11]: It has become common in public discourse to dismiss—nay, to denigrate—God’s Sabbath by referring to it as the “Jewish Sabbath.” Yet the truth remains: there was not a single Jew in the Garden of Eden when God instituted it.

## What will be the crowning deception?

> For such are false apostles, deceitful workers, *transforming themselves into the apostles of Christ*. And no marvel; for *Satan himself is transformed into an angel of light*. Therefore it is no great thing if his ministers also be transformed as the ministers of righteousness; whose end shall be according to their works.
{% ct '2 Corinthians 11:13-15' %}

> Then if any man shall say unto you, Lo, *here is Christ, or there; believe it not*. For there *shall arise false Christs, and false prophets, and shall shew great signs and wonders*; insomuch that, if it were possible, they shall deceive the very elect.
{% ct 'Matthew 24:23-24' %}

> Ye are of your father the devil, and the lusts of your father ye will do. He was a murderer from the beginning, and abode not in the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he speaketh a lie, he speaketh of his own: for *he is a liar, and the father of it*.
{% ct 'John 8:44' %}

There will be reports of a dazzling angel claiming to be Jesus, but in reality, it will be Satan impersonating Him. The fallen angel could quote Scripture, perform miracles, and even claim to have changed the Sabbath to Sunday in order to urge the world to honor his counterfeit day. The Bible says the deception will be so effective that the whole world will be deceived by it {% rf 'Revelation 13:3' %}—except for God’s true followers, who will test everything by Scripture {% rf 'Isaiah 8:19-20; 2 Timothy 2:15' %}. They will know that God’s law cannot change {% rf 'Luke 16:17; 21:33' %}. Moreover, they will recognize it is not Jesus, because according to the Bible, He will not touch the earth at His second coming but will remain in the clouds to meet His people in the air {% rf '1 Thessalonians 4:16-17' %}.

## Will there be a genuine revival?

> And I saw another angel fly in the midst of heaven, *having the everlasting gospel to preach unto them that dwell on the earth, and to every nation, and kindred, and tongue, and people*, saying with a loud voice, *Fear God, and give glory to him; for the hour of his judgment is come: and worship him that made* heaven, and earth, and the sea, and the fountains of waters.
>
> And there followed another angel, saying, *Babylon is fallen, is fallen*, that great city, because she made all nations drink of the wine of the wrath of her fornication.
>
> And the third angel followed them, saying with a loud voice, *If any man worship the beast and his image, and receive his mark in his forehead, or in his hand, the same shall drink of the wine of the wrath of God, which is poured out without mixture into the cup of his indignation*; and he shall be tormented with fire and brimstone in the presence of the holy angels, and in the presence of the Lamb: and the smoke of their torment ascendeth up for ever and ever: and they have no rest day nor night, who worship the beast and his image, and whosoever receiveth the mark of his name. Here is the patience of the saints: here are they that keep the commandments of God, and the faith of Jesus.
{% ct 'Revelation 14:6-12' %}

As Satan works to deceive the world into compromising with error by casting aside God’s Sabbath in favor of a counterfeit day He never appointed, God will have a people who will proclaim a powerful, three-part message to the entire world—symbolized by the three angels of Revelation 14. This message will expose Satan’s deceptions so that every person will be informed about God’s true Sabbath and warned against receiving the mark of the beast—the counterfeit Sunday— because this decision carries eternal consequences.[^12] Those who choose to obey—and thus worship—the beast by honoring his man-made “holy” day will receive his mark, by which they cut themselves off from God’s mercy and exclude themselves from His eternal kingdom. But there will also be those who join God’s side, choosing to worship Him on His holy day. Through faith, Jesus’ sacrifice on the cross will cover their confessed and forsaken sins, and His grace will transform them into obedient followers, sealing them for eternity {% rf 'Revelation 7:2-3' %}.

[^12]: It may seem improbable that people’s eternal destiny will be determined by the day they choose to observe, but God often uses simple means to test our loyalty; affter all, Adam and Eve were expelled from the Garden for eating fruit from the wrong tree. Of course, the fruit was merely the means of settling a far greater issue—trust. Would Adam and Eve trust God or Satan? In the same way, the day of worship will represent the far greater issue of *authority*. Every person will have to decide: Whom will I acknowledge as the ultimate authority over my life—God or Satan?

## Who is the false prophet of Revelation 16:13?

> And I saw three unclean spirits like frogs come out of the mouth of the dragon, and out of the mouth of the beast, and *out of the mouth of the false prophet*.
{% ct 'Revelation 16:13' %}

> And the beast was taken, and *with him the false prophet that wrought miracles before him, with which he deceived them that had received the mark of the beast*, and them that worshipped his image. These both were cast alive into a lake of fire burning with brimstone.
{% ct 'Revelation 19:20' %}

The false prophet works miracles to deceive people into receiving the beast’s mark and worshiping his image. This miracle-working carries a spiritual connotation, as does the term *false prophet*. The lamb-like beast of {% rf 'Revelation 13:11-18' false %} (representing the United States) also performs miracles {% rf 'Revelation 13:13-14' %}, and thus appears spiritual and trustworthy. In reality, however, it sets itself against God’s commandments by lending its power and influence to promote the Sunday-keeping movement on behalf of the papacy. The false prophet, therefore, represents the religious aspect—apostate Protestantism—of the lamb-like beast.

It is called the false prophet because of Protestantism’s acceptance and propagation of the Preterist and Futurist interpretations of prophecy, both of which are false. The Protestant Reformers—such as John Wycliffe, John Huss, Martin Luther, William Tyndale, Nicholas Ridley, Thomas Cranmer, and John Knox—all held to the Historicist view, which identifies the [Antichrist](/posts/prophecy/antichrist.md) as the papacy; however, both Preterism and Futurism divert attention *away* from the papacy.[^13] Sadly, Protestantism has rejected the view of its founders and has thus become the false prophet.

[^13]: Incidentally, both interpretations were introduced by Roman Catholic Jesuits: Preterism by Luis de Alcázar and Futurism by Francisco Ribera. Preterism holds that the prophecies of Revelation were fulfilled in the past, prior to the rise of the papacy, while Futurism teaches that the Antichrist—understood as a future *individual*—will appear after the literal rebuilding of the Third Temple in Jerusalem. Futurism is especially popular in conservative religious circles in Washington, D.C., and appears to be influencing, at least in part, national policy regarding Israel.

## Is this the battle of Armageddon?

> And the sixth angel poured out his vial upon the great river Euphrates; and the *water thereof was dried up, that the way of the kings of the east might be prepared*. And I saw three unclean spirits like frogs come out of the mouth of the dragon, and out of the mouth of the beast, and out of the mouth of the false prophet. For they are the spirits of devils, working miracles, *which go forth unto the kings of the earth and of the whole world, to gather them to the battle of that great day of God Almighty*. Behold, I come as a thief. Blessed is he that watcheth, and keepeth his garments, lest he walk naked, and they see his shame. And *he gathered them together into a place called in the Hebrew tongue Armageddon*.
{% ct 'Revelation 16:12-16' %}

> And I saw the beast, and the kings of the earth, and their armies, *gathered together to make war against him that sat on the horse, and against his army*.
{% ct 'Revelation 19:19' %}

> *These have one mind, and shall give their power and strength unto the beast. These shall make war with the Lamb, and the Lamb shall overcome them*: for he is Lord of lords, and King of kings: and they that are with him are called, and chosen, and faithful.
{% ct 'Revelation 17:13-14' %}

The battle of Armageddon is the final conflict between Christ and Satan. It is mentioned in the context of the beast and the false prophet, which indicates that it will be initiated by them and will involve all the nations of the world in a united effort against Jesus and His people, with the goal of destroying all who refuse to worship the beast. But God will intervene.

The symbolic Euphrates River will dry up, meaning that popular support for the beast will disappear {% rf 'Revelation 17:15' %}, just prior to the coming of the “kings from the east,” a reference to the Second Coming of Christ {% rf 'Ezekiel 43:2; Matthew 24:27' %}, when the people of God will be delivered {% rf 'Revelation 19:11-20' %}. The battle will resume after [the millennium](/posts/prophecy/millennium.md), when Satan and his followers surround the New Jerusalem in an attempt to capture it, but before they do, they are destroyed by fire from heaven {% rf 'Revelation 20:9' %}, bringing the battle—and the great controversy between good and evil—to a final end.

## How can I be safe from deception?

> To the law and to the testimony: *if they speak not according to this word, it is because there is no light in them*.
{% ct 'Isaiah 8:20' %}

> *If any man will do his will, he shall know of the doctrine*, whether it be of God, or whether I speak of myself.
{% ct 'John 7:17' %}

> I am the vine, ye are the branches: He that abideth in me, and I in him, the same bringeth forth much fruit: for *without me ye can do nothing*.
{% ct 'John 15:5' %}

Jesus will help me identify and avoid deception if I test every teaching by the Bible {% rf 'Psalm 119:104' %}, willingly follow the truth as He reveals it to me, and stay close to Him daily through prayer and the reading of His Word. While the battle may appear to be against Christ’s followers, ultimately it is against Him. The battle is His, and it has already been won on a hill called Calvary. The only question is: have I given Him my heart and joined His winning side?

## What does the Bible promise?

> He that dwelleth in the secret place of the most High shall abide under the shadow of the Almighty. I will say of the LORD, *He is my refuge and my fortress: my God; in him will I trust*. Surely he shall deliver thee from the snare of the fowler, and from the noisome pestilence. He shall cover thee with his feathers, and under his wings shalt thou trust: *his truth shall be thy shield and buckler*. Thou shalt not be afraid for the terror by night; nor for the arrow that flieth by day; nor for the pestilence that walketh in darkness; nor for the destruction that wasteth at noonday. A thousand shall fall at thy side, and ten thousand at thy right hand; but it shall not come nigh thee. Only with thine eyes shalt thou behold and see the reward of the wicked.
>
> Because thou hast made the LORD, which is my refuge, even the most High, thy habitation; there shall no evil befall thee, neither shall any plague come nigh thy dwelling. *For he shall give his angels charge over thee, to keep thee in all thy ways*. They shall bear thee up in their hands, lest thou dash thy foot against a stone. Thou shalt tread upon the lion and adder: the young lion and the dragon shalt thou trample under feet. Because he hath set his love upon me, therefore will I deliver him: I will set him on high, because he hath known my name. *He shall call upon me, and I will answer him: I will be with him in trouble; I will deliver him*, and honour him. With long life will I satisfy him, and shew him my salvation.

God promises that His truth will be our shield against the arrows of deception, keeping us on the narrow path of righteousness that leads to His eternal kingdom.
