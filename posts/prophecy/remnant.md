## Jesus established His church upon what foundation?

> And I say also unto thee, That thou art Peter, and *upon this rock I will build my church*; and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it.
{% ref 'Matthew 16:18' %}

> And did all drink the same spiritual drink: for they drank of that spiritual Rock that followed them: and *that Rock was Christ*.
{% ref '1 Corinthians 10:4' %}

> For other foundation can no man lay than that is laid, *which is Jesus Christ*.
{% ref '1 Corinthians 3:11' %}

> For the husband is the head of the wife, even as *Christ is the head of the church*: and he is the saviour of the body.
{% ref 'Ephesians 5:23' %}

Jesus established His church upon Himself, the Rock. Paul makes it clear that Jesus is also the foundation, as well as the head of the church. Moreover, He is the only Mediator between God and man (<a>1 Timothy 2:5</a>). The word used for Peter in <a>Matthew 16:18</a> is “Petros,” which refers to a detached stone that can be moved around. Peter was a mere man who later ended up denying Christ (<a>Matthew 26:69-75</a>), so he could not be the foundation of the church. The word for “Rock” in <a>Matthew 16:18</a> is “petra,” which refers to an immovable mass of rock&mdash;a solid foundation&mdash;Jesus Christ Himself.

## Was there a church after His ascension?

> Praising God, and having favour with all the people. And the *Lord added to the church daily* such as should be saved.
{% ref 'Acts 2:47' %}

> Then *had the churches rest* throughout all Judaea and Galilee and Samaria, and were edified; and walking in the fear of the Lord, and in the comfort of the Holy Ghost, were multiplied.
{% ref 'Acts 9:31' %}

> *Not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together*, as the manner of some is; but exhorting one another: and so much the more, as ye see the day approaching.
{% ref 'Hebrews 10:25' %}

After Jesus ascended to heaven, the church He established multiplied as it shared the truths it received from Christ with the world. Though it did not have an official denominational name, it was described as the body of Christ (<a>Colossians 1:18</a>). It was organized and included deacons, elders, and missionaries (<a>1 Timothy 3:8-13; Titus 1:5-9; Acts 13:4, 5</a>). Paul encouraged believers to attend church&mdash;a practice that’s in harmony with the example set by Jesus Himself, who faithfully attended church every Sabbath (<a>Luke 4:16</a>). Attending church offers opportunities to encourage others, brings the blessings of community, enables the gospel to be shared more effectively, and enhances one’s own spiritual journey.

## How did Paul describe the church?

> But if I tarry long, that thou mayest know how thou oughtest to behave thyself in the house of God, which is the church of the living God, the *pillar and ground of the truth*.
{% ref '1 Timothy 3:15' %}

God’s church was characterized by a commitment to the truth taught by Jesus, not manmade traditions, customs, or doctrines. But Paul also warned about apostasy coming in that would lead to a falling away from the church Jesus established (<a>2 Thessalonians 2:3</a>), which occured roughly 300 years after the establishment of Christianity when pagan customs and teachings started to make inroads.

## How does Revelation describe God’s church in the last days?

> And there appeared a great wonder in heaven; a woman *clothed with the sun, and the moon under her feet, and upon her head a crown of twelve stars*.
{% ref 'Revelation 12:1' %}

We learned in the previous lesson that a woman represents a church. A harlot represents an apostate church, while a pure woman represents God’s true church&mdash;the bride of Christ (<a>Revelation 19:7, 8; 2 Corinthians 11:2</a>). In <a>Revelation 12:1</a> we see a woman in stark contrast to the harlot of Revelation 17. She is clothed with the sun, which symbolizes Jesus and His righteousness (<a>Psalm 84:11; Malachi 4:2</a>), without which there is no salvation (<a>Acts 4:12</a>). This imagery illustrates Jesus’ desire for the church to radiate His glory to the world. The woman also has a moon under her feet, which has no light of its own, but reflects the light of the sun. This represents the sacrificial system of the Old Testament, which reflected the light of the Messiah to come (<a>Hebrews 10:1</a>). Her crown of 12 stars represents the work of the 12 disciples that crowned, or laid the foundation of, the New Testament church.

## What happens to the woman?

> And she *being with child cried*, travailing in birth, and pained to be delivered. And there appeared another wonder in heaven; and behold a great red dragon, having seven heads and ten horns, and seven crowns upon his heads. And his tail drew the third part of the stars of heaven, and did cast them to the earth: and the *dragon stood before the woman which was ready to be delivered, for to devour her child as soon as it was born*. And she brought forth a man child, who was to rule all nations with a rod of iron: and *her child was caught up unto God*, and to his throne. 
{% ref 'Revelation 12:2-5' %}

The woman is about to deliver a baby, representing Jesus, who would one day rule all nations with a rod of iron&mdash;a reference to <a>Revelation 2:27</a> and <a>Revelation 19:13-15</a>, which points to Jesus coming to the defense of His people when He returns the second time. There’s a red dragon who tries to devour the baby as soon as it’s born, but it escapes and is caught up to God’s throne&mdash;a reference to Jesus’ ascension to heaven. The dragon represents Satan, working through pagan Rome, trying to kill Jesus at His birth through Herod’s decree to kill all the babies of Bethlehem (<a>Matthew 2:16</a>).

## What do the seven heads and ten horns represent?

>  And here is the mind which hath wisdom. The *seven heads are seven mountains*, on which the woman sitteth.
{% ref 'Revelation 17:9' %}

> And the *ten horns out of this kingdom are ten kings* that shall arise: and another shall rise after them; and he shall be diverse from the first, and he shall subdue three kings.
{% ref 'Daniel 7:24' %}

The dragon’s seven heads represent the seven hills of Rome, while the ten horns represent the 10 barbarian tribes that arose after the fall of the Roman Empire (<a>Daniel 7:23, 24</a>) and eventually became the nations of modern Europe. Ultimately, the dragon represents Satan&mdash;working not just through pagan Rome, but the 10 nations that arose out of it&mdash;persecuting God’s people. It refers to the time Christians were persecuted by the Roman Empire after Christ’s ascension as well as the European nations cooperating with the papacy’s persecution during the Dark Ages. In the last days, the ten horns represent all the nations of the world aligning with spiritual Babylon in its fight against God’s followers (<a>Revelation 16:14; 17:12, 13</a>; see “Fall of Spiritual Babylon”).

The reference to a third of the stars of heaven being cast down to earth points to the angels who supported Lucifer during his rebellion against God being cast out of heaven (<a>Revelation 12:9; Luke 10:18; Isaiah 14:12</a>; see “Origin of Evil”).

## What happens next?

>  And when the dragon saw that he was cast unto the earth, *he persecuted the woman which brought forth the man child*. And to the woman were given two wings of a great eagle, that she might *fly into the wilderness*, into her place, where she is nourished for a time, and times, and half a time, from the face of the serpent.
{% ref 'Revelation 12:13' %}

> And the woman *fled into the wilderness*, where she hath a place prepared of God, that they should feed her there a thousand two hundred and threescore days.
{% ref 'Revelation 12:6' %}

Once Satan was no longer able to attack Jesus personally, he shifted his focus to persecuting God’s church. He first used the Roman Empire to persecute her, but later he switched to apostasy, which led to a split (falling away). He then started working through the apostate church to resume his persecution against the faithful church, but she was given wings, representing God’s protection (<a>Exodus 19:4; Deuteronomy 32:11</a>), so she could escape into the wilderness where she could preserve and live out God’s truths for “a time and times and half a time,” which is three and a half prophetic years or 1,260 literal years (see [“Who is the Antichrist?”](/posts/prophecy/antichrist.md#what-power-fits-these-characteristics)).

Satan began working through papal Rome at this time. (Note that the time spent in the wilderness matches the 1,260 year period of papal dominance&mdash;538 to 1798.) The wilderness refers to solitary places (mountains, caves, forests, deserts, etc.) where God’s church could hide to escape being totally destroyed (<a>Hebrews 11:37, 38</a>). The history and persecution of the Waldenses, Albigenses, and Huguenots, among many others, testifies to this reality. Millions died for their faith at the hands of the papacy, but God did not allow His church to be totally obliterated because the truth had to be preserved. God ensured that the doctrines of the apostolic church, which had entered this period of hiding, were preserved when the persecuted church came out of hiding.

## What does God call His end-time church?

> And the dragon was wroth with the woman, and went to make war with the *remnant of her seed*, which *keep the commandments of God, and have the testimony of Jesus Christ*.
{% ref 'Revelation 12:17' %}

> Here is the patience of the saints: here are they that *keep the commandments of God, and the faith of Jesus*.
{% ref 'Revelation 14:12' %}

The word “remnant” refers to the last remaining portion of something, so in reference to God’s church, it points to His church in the last days. This church is then given two characteristics: she keeps the commandments of God, including the seventh-day Sabbath of the fourth commandment (<a>John 14:15; Revelation 22:14</a>), and has the testimony of Jesus, which is the spirit of prophecy (<a>Revelation 19:10</a>). <a>Revelation 12:17</a> is an echo of <a>Revelation 14:12</a>, so the “testimony of Jesus Christ” can also refer to the faith and teachings of Jesus. Just as the remnant of a cloth has the same color and pattern as the original, the remnant church will return to the truths taught by Christ and believed by the original Christian church He established.

Furthermore, in the previous question we learned that God’s church went into hiding from the year 538 to 1798, so even though the church was still alive, it did not exist as an official organization during that time. In other words, God’s last day, remnant church had to arise after 1798, but the process started during the great Protestant Reformation, which led to the Bible being translated into the common language so it could be read by all. Once that happened, the light of the gospel began to shine, and it would not be stopped&mdash;“the gates of hell shall not prevail against it” (<a>Matthew 16:18</a>).

## Is there anything else about the remnant church?

> And I saw another angel fly in the midst of heaven, *having the everlasting gospel to preach unto them that dwell on the earth*, and to every nation, and kindred, and tongue, and people, Saying with a loud voice, *Fear God, and give glory to him; for the hour of his judgment is come: and worship him that made* heaven, and earth, and the sea, and the fountains of waters. And there followed another angel, saying, *Babylon is fallen, is fallen, that great city, because she made all nations drink of the wine of the wrath of her fornication*.

And the third angel followed them, saying with a loud voice, *If any man worship the beast and his image, and receive his mark in his forehead, or in his hand, the same shall drink of the wine of the wrath of God*, which is poured out without mixture into the cup of his indignation; and he shall be tormented with fire and brimstone in the presence of the holy angels, and in the presence of the Lamb: and the smoke of their torment ascendeth up for ever and ever: and they have no rest day nor night, who worship the beast and his image, and whosoever receiveth the mark of his name. Here is the patience of the saints: here are they that keep the commandments of God, and the faith of Jesus.
{% ref 'Revelation 14:6-12' %}

The spirit of the Reformation continued through the centuries, leading to the establishment of God’s remnant that returned back to the teachings of the original church established by Jesus. This remnant church then preaches a three-point message, symbolized by the three angels of Revelation 14, that goes out to the entire world:

1. The first message calls people to fear God, which is an echo of <a>Ecclesiastes 12:13, 14</a> and a call to live a life of reverence for God that leads to keeping His commandments (see [“God’s Law of Love”](/posts/gospel/law.md)). It then calls people to give glory to Him, which is an echo of <a>1 Corinthians 10:31</a> and a call to live a life that glorifies Him in everything, including diet (see [“God’s Health Plan”](/posts/basics/health.md)). The first message also announces that God’s judgment has already begun, and it calls people to worship Him as Creator (<a>Revelation 4:11</a>). This call to worship quotes the fourth commandment (<a>Exodus 20:8-11</a>), which identifies God as the Creator (<a>Genesis 2:1-3</a>) and invites people to worship Him as Creator by keeping His seventh-day Sabbath holy (see [“Sabbath Keeping”](/posts/basics/keeping.md)).

1. The second message calls people to come out of the fallen churches of spiritual Babylon (see [“Are You Part of Babylon?”](/posts/prophecy/babylon.md)).

1. The third message warns against worshiping the beast or receiving his mark, which is the observance of the papal Sunday in place of God’s true seventh-day Sabbath (see [“Mark of the Beast”](/posts/prophecy/mark.md)).

Because this three-point message goes to the entire world, the remnant church must be a worldwide missionary church that preaches this three-point message. With the addition of the previously identified clues, we now have the following list of characteristics regarding the remnant church:

1. It would arise after 1798.
1. It would believe all the teachings of Jesus.
1. It would have the spirit of prophecy.
1. It would keep the commandments of God, including His seventh-day Sabbath.
1. It would be a worldwide missionary church.
1. It would be preaching the three angels’ messages of Revelation 14.

## How many churches fit these characteristics?

> *There is one body*, and one Spirit, even as ye are called in one hope of your calling; one Lord, one faith, one baptism; one God and Father of all, who is above all, and through all, and in you all.
{% ref 'Ephesians 4:4-6' %}

> And other sheep I have, which are not of this fold: them also I must bring, and they shall hear my voice; and *there shall be one fold, and one shepherd*.
{% ref 'John 10:16' %}

The six characteristics above are specific enough that they fit only one church&mdash;the Seventh-day Adventist Church. Founded in 1863, it was born out of a desire to follow Jesus in accordance with the Bible alone; in this regard, it was a product and a continuation of the work of the Reformers. Being the only global organization preaching the three angels’ messages of Revelation 14, it’s committed to sharing the gospel of Jesus with the entire world.

Moreover, according to Paul, God has one body of believers, not a multitude of churches that often present contradictory messages leading to confusion. He has His people in other churches, no doubt, which is why He’s calling them out (<a>Revelation 18:4</a>; see “Fall of Spiritual Babylon”) and seeking to bring all of His followers together into His final church of the last days&mdash;into a unity that is based on the truths of His Word. The Greek word for “church” is “ekklesia,” and it literally means “called-out ones.” Just like there was only one way of escape in the time of Noah&mdash;the ark, Jesus has provided another kind of ark, the church, the pillar of truth (<a>1 Timothy 3:15</a>), to take His people safely through the closing moments of earth, and it’s absolutely crucial for every believer to be convinced, based on the Bible, that the church one attends meets the biblical criteria of God’s remnant church.

## What about the hypocrites in the church?

> But go ye and learn what that meaneth, I will have mercy, and not sacrifice: for *I am not come to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance*.
{% ref 'Matthew 9:13' %}

> Husbands, love your wives, even as *Christ also loved the church, and gave himself for it*.
{% ref 'Ephesians 5:25' %}

The church is made of people, and people are not perfect. The church is more of a hospital for broken people whom Christ wants to heal and restore into His image. We are also called to be followers of Christ, not other Christians. Staying out of the church because of others was not what Jesus did. He faithfully attended church even though it was far from perfect, and despite the imperfect people there, Paul tells us that Jesus loves His church so much that He died for her (<a>Ephesians 5:25</a>). At the same time, Satan has not ceased his attack on God’s remnant church; he has just changed his tactics&mdash;from outright persecution in times past to a subtler strategy that is more inline with modern times, like discrediting her by spreading lies, but such actions are the very fulfillment of <a>Revelation 12:17</a>.

## To what kind of church does Jesus return?

> That he might present it to himself *a glorious church, not having spot, or wrinkle, or any such thing; but that it should be holy and without blemish*.
{% ref 'Ephesians 5:27' %}

> But if I tarry long, that thou mayest know how thou oughtest to behave thyself in the house of God, which is the church of the living God, *the pillar and ground of the truth*.
{% ref '1 Timothy 3:15' %}

> Here is the patience of the saints: here are they that *keep the commandments of God, and the faith of Jesus*.
{% ref 'Revelation 14:12' %}

> For *this is the love of God, that we keep His commandments*. And His commandments are not burdensome.
{% ref '1 John 5:3' %}

The good news is that Jesus returns to a glorious church built on and in harmony with Bible truth, made up of faithful followers who refuse and separate from pagan teachings and traditions. They are known for their love of, loyalty to, and faith in Jesus, which is made evident in their obedience to His commandments.

## What invitation does the bride of Revelation give?

> And the Spirit and the bride say, *Come*. And let him that heareth say, Come. And *let him that is athirst come. And whosoever will, let him take the water of life freely*.
{% ref 'Revelation 22:17' %}

In the last days everybody will be worshiping. Very soon there will be only two religions in the world: one worshiping and obeying Jesus and the other worshiping and obeying the dictates of man (see [“Mark of the Beast”](/posts/prophecy/mark.md)). Now is the time to follow Jesus’ call to come and be a part of His remnant church, of which He is the head (<a>Colossians 1:18</a>), to drink His eternal, life-giving truths, as revealed in His Word, and join in sharing His final message with the world.
