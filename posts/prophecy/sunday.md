## Is the Sabbath temporary or perpetual?

> Wherefore the children of Israel shall keep the sabbath, to observe the sabbath throughout their generations, *for a perpetual covenant. It is a sign between me and the children of Israel for ever*: for in six days the LORD made heaven and earth, and on the seventh day he rested, and was refreshed. And he gave unto Moses, when he had made an end of communing with him upon mount Sinai, two tables of testimony, *tables of stone*, written with the finger of God.
{% ct 'Exodus 31:16-18' %}

The Ten Commandments, of which the Sabbath is a part, were written by the finger of God on tablets of stone rather than on materials subject to decay, such as wood or clay, as a testament to their timelessness. In contrast, Jesus wrote the sins of the woman caught in adultery in the dust {% rf 'John 8:1-11' %}, a beautiful testament to God’s willingness to forgive all who repent. Sin is temporary and will be [blotted out](/posts/prophecy/millennium.md) of the universe, but the law that God desires to write in our hearts is eternal {% rf 'Jeremiah 31:33; Matthew 5:17-18' %}.

## Wasn’t the Sabbath for the Jewish people only?

> Thus the heavens and the earth were finished, and all the host of them. And on the seventh day God ended his work which he had made; and he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had made. And *God blessed the seventh day, and sanctified it: because that in it he had rested from all his work which God created and made*.
{% ct 'Genesis 2:1-3' %}

> For as the new heavens and the new earth, which I will make, shall remain before me, saith the LORD, so shall your seed and your name remain. And it shall come to pass, that from one new moon to another, and *from one sabbath to another, shall all flesh come to worship before me*, saith the LORD.
{% ct 'Isaiah 66:22-23' %}

The seventh-day Sabbath was set apart, blessed, and sanctified in the very first week of creation, long before there was a Jewish nation, and it will be kept even in heaven as a testament to God as our Creator and Redeemer. The Sabbath was instituted in Eden for all humanity, and as long as we are His creation, whom He has redeemed, so long will the Sabbath stand.

## How many need sanctification?

> For *all have sinned*, and come short of the glory of God.
{% ct 'Romans 3:23' %}

> Moreover also I gave them my sabbaths, to be a sign between me and them, that they might know that *I am the LORD that sanctify them*.
{% ct 'Ezekiel 20:12' %}

Because all have sinned, all need the sanctifying power of Christ—of which the Sabbath is a sign; therefore, it cannot be a sign for the Jewish nation only, for sin is no respecter of persons, just as God’s power to sanctify is no respecter of sinners. As God set the Sabbath apart as a day for Himself, so He sets us apart as a people for Himself {% rf '1 Peter 2:9; 2 Corinthians 6:17-18' %}.

## Is the Sabbath an antidote to salvation by works?

> For he spake in a certain place of the seventh day on this wise, and God did rest the seventh day from all his works. … There remaineth therefore a rest to the people of God. *For he that is entered into his rest, he also hath ceased from his own works, as God did from his. Let us labour therefore to enter into that rest*, lest any man fall after the same example of unbelief.
{% ct 'Hebrews 4:4-6, 9-11' %}

The Sabbath is a memorial of God as both Creator and Redeemer. Just as He rested from His work of creation on the seventh day, so Jesus rested from His work of redemption in the tomb. The Sabbath, therefore, is a sign of resting in Christ by faith in His completed work on my behalf. In other words, to deny the Sabbath is, in essence, to deny salvation by faith. Because I cannot sanctify or save myself, I am invited to cease striving for salvation by my own works and to rest in the righteous life of Jesus instead. By resting on the seventh day, I acknowledge this sublime truth.

## What happened as the Sabbath approached after Jesus died?

> And that day was the preparation, and the sabbath drew on. And the women also, which came with him from Galilee, followed after, and beheld the sepulchre, and how his body was laid. And they returned, and prepared spices and ointments; and *rested the sabbath day according to the commandment*.
{% ct 'Luke 23:54-56' %}

The Bible points out that, since it was the Day of Preparation (Friday) and the Sabbath was about to [begin at sunset](/posts/basics/keeping.md#when-does-the-sabbath-start-and-end), Jesus’ followers were so concerned about keeping the Sabbath that they even stopped their labor of love in preparing the body of their beloved Savior for burial. They rested on the Sabbath, as commanded, and returned early on Sunday morning to resume their unfinished work.

## What happened on the first day?

> Now upon the *first day of the week*, very early in the morning, *they came unto the sepulchre*, bringing the spices which they had prepared, and certain others with them.
{% ct 'Luke 24:1' %}

> In the end of the sabbath, as it began to dawn toward the *first day of the week, came Mary Magdalene and the other Mary to see the sepulchre*.
{% ct 'Matthew 28:1' %}

> And very early in the morning the *first day of the week, they came unto the sepulchre* at the rising of the sun.
{% ct 'Mark 16:2' %}

> The *first day of the week cometh Mary Magdalene early, when it was yet dark, unto the sepulchre*, and seeth the stone taken away from the sepulchre.
{% ct 'John 20:1' %}

It is important to note that Jesus’ followers returned to the tomb because they still had unfinished burial work to complete. Since they brought spices with them, it is evident they did not expect to find Him resurrected, so their Sunday morning labor of love was not an act of honoring His resurrection but rather a continuation of their burial work.

## Did Jesus command the keeping of Sunday?

> Now when Jesus was risen early the *first day of the week, he appeared first to Mary Magdalene*, out of whom he had cast seven devils. And she went and told them that had been with him, as they mourned and wept.
{% ct 'Mark 16:9' %}

> Jesus saith unto her, Woman, why weepest thou? whom seekest thou? She, supposing him to be the gardener, saith unto him, Sir, if thou have borne him hence, tell me where thou hast laid him, and I will take him away. Jesus saith unto her, Mary. She turned herself, and saith unto him, Rabboni; which is to say, Master. *Jesus saith unto her, Touch me not; for I am not yet ascended to my Father: but go to my brethren, and say unto them, I ascend unto my Father, and your Father; and to my God, and your God*. Mary Magdalene came and told the disciples that she had seen the Lord, and that he had spoken these things unto her.
{% ct 'John 20:15-18' %}

After His resurrection, Jesus had multiple opportunities to instruct His followers to keep Sunday as the new Sabbath in honor of His resurrection, but this He never did. When He appeared to Mary Magdalene that morning, there was no mention of Sunday at all. Considering the many Old Testament passages in which God Himself commands the observance of the seventh-day Sabbath, one would reasonably expect at least one verse in the New Testament where Jesus—or His Father—commands His followers to keep Sunday instead. Yet no such verse exists.

## How do we honor Jesus’ resurrection?

> Know ye not, that so many of us as were baptized into Jesus Christ were baptized into his death? Therefore *we are buried with him by baptism into death: that like as Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the Father, even so we also should walk in newness of life*. For if we have been planted together in the likeness of his death, we shall be also in the likeness of his resurrection: knowing this, that *our old man is crucified with him, that the body of sin might be destroyed, that henceforth we should not serve sin*. For he that is dead is freed from sin. Now if we be dead with Christ, we believe that we shall also live with him.
{% ct 'Romans 6:3-8' %}

Jesus instituted [baptism by immersion](/posts/basics/baptism.md) as a symbol of His death, burial, and resurrection. In baptism, a person goes briefly under the water, representing death to sin and burial with Christ, and then rises out of the water to a new life in and for Christ.

## Didn’t the disciples break bread on the first day?

> And upon the *first day of the week, when the disciples came together to break bread*, Paul preached unto them, ready to depart on the morrow; and continued his speech until midnight.
{% ct 'Acts 20:7' %}

> And they continued stedfastly in the apostles’ doctrine and fellowship, and *in breaking of bread*, and in prayers. … And they, *continuing daily with one accord in the temple, and breaking bread from house to house*, did eat their meat with gladness and singleness of heart.
{% ct 'Acts 2:42, 46' %}

The meeting in which bread was broken on the first day of the week occurred because Paul was leaving the next day. Apart from this unique circumstance, the meeting had no special significance, since the early Christians broke bread daily.
## What about John 20:19?

> Mary Magdalene came and told the disciples that she had seen the Lord, and that he had spoken these things unto her. Then *the same day at evening, being the first day of the week*, when the doors were shut where the disciples were assembled for fear of the Jews, *came Jesus and stood in the midst*, and saith unto them, Peace be unto you. And when he had so said, he shewed unto them his hands and his side. Then were the disciples glad, when they saw the Lord. Then said Jesus to them again, Peace be unto you: as my Father hath sent me, even so send I you.
{% ct 'John 20:18-21' %}

> Afterward he appeared unto the eleven as they sat at meat, and upbraided them with their unbelief and hardness of heart, *because they believed not them which had seen him after he was risen*.
{% ct 'Mark 16:14' %}

Mark tells us that after Jesus’ disciples heard He had risen, they did not at first believe the reports, so later that same day He appeared to them in person. Since they did not believe He had risen, they could not have gathered to honor His resurrection. Moreover, after He appeared, He had the perfect opportunity to declare Sunday holy, but—just as in His interaction with Mary—He did not do so. Finally, according to the Bible, days begin at sunset {% rf 'Genesis 1:5' %}; thus, biblically—and for the Jews—this Sunday evening gathering would actually have been Monday.

## How about 1 Corinthians 16:2?

> Now concerning the collection for the saints, as I have given order to the churches of Galatia, even so do ye. Upon the *first day of the week let every one of you lay by him in store*, as God hath prospered him, that there be no gatherings when I come. And when I come, whomsoever ye shall approve by your letters, them will I send to bring your liberality unto Jerusalem.
{% ct '1 Corinthians 16:1-3' %}

Here Paul is asking each person to put money aside for the needy, privately, once the Sabbath is over, so it would be ready when he comes. Nothing in these passages indicates that they regarded the first day holy.

## What did Jesus say about the law?

> Think not that I am come to destroy the law, or the prophets: *I am not come to destroy, but to fulfil*. For verily I say unto you, till heaven and earth pass, *one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law*, till all be fulfilled.
{% ct 'Matthew 5:17-18' %}

There are no verses in the Bible of Jesus changing the fourth commandment to mean observing Sunday instead of Saturday, nor did He tell others to do so later on. On the contrary, His mission was to fulfill the law, to uphold and expand it beyond the “letter” of the law to include the “spirit” of the law, as well. (For example, He expanded the sin of adultery to also include lust of the heart in {% rf 'Matthew 5:28' false %}.)

## How is the law fulfilled?

> Love worketh no ill to his neighbour: therefore *love is the fulfilling of the law*.
{% ct 'Romans 13:10' %}

It was a heart filled with love for His Father that enabled Jesus to fulfill the law in His life.

## Can the law be fulfilled in my life?

> That the righteousness of the law *might be fulfilled in us*, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit.
{% ct 'Romans 8:4' %}

> *Ask, and it shall be given you*; seek, and ye shall find; knock, and it shall be opened unto you: *For every one that asketh receiveth*; and he that seeketh findeth; and to him that knocketh it shall be opened.
{% ct 'Matthew 7:7-8' %}

If my heart is actuated by love for Jesus and filled with the Holy Spirit then the law can be fulfilled in my life too. I just have to ask Him and have faith that He can and will do it.
