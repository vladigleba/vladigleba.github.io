## What is one of the ways God speaks to humanity?

> *I have also spoken by the prophets*, and I have multiplied visions, and used similitudes, by the ministry of the prophets.
{% ct 'Hosea 12:10' %}

> Surely the Lord GOD will do nothing, but he *revealeth his secret unto his servants the prophets*.
{% ct 'Amos 3:7' %}

> Remember the former things of old: for I am God, and there is none else; I am God, and there is none like me, *declaring the end from the beginning, and from ancient times the things that are not yet done*, saying, My counsel shall stand, and I will do all my pleasure.
{% ct 'Isaiah 46:9-10' %}

God has chosen to use prophets to speak to humanity on His behalf; they share His messages and make His will known. Before significant events unfold, God reveals His intentions to the world through them, so that the human family is warned and prepared.

For example, He used Noah to warn the world about the flood {% rf '2 Peter 2:5' %}, while Jeremiah warned Israel about their 70-year captivity in Babylon {% rf 'Jeremiah 25:11' %}. Regarding the coming of the Messiah, Isaiah announced that Jesus would would be born of a virgin {% rf 'Isaiah 7:14' %}, Micah said He would be born in Bethlehem {% rf 'Micah 5:2' %}, and Daniel prophesied that He would be “cut off” or killed {% rf 'Daniel 9:26' %}. Later, God used John the Baptist to announce that His coming was near {% rf 'John 1:23-27' %}. After Jesus’ ascension, Paul announced that Jesus would return a second time {% rf '1 Thessalonians 4:16-17' %}, and given the importance of His return, we can expect the gift of prophecy to be evident again in the last days to warn and prepare the world.

## What warning did Jesus give about prophets?

> And *many false prophets shall rise, and shall deceive many*. And because iniquity shall abound, the love of many shall wax cold. ... For there shall *arise false Christs, and false prophets*, and shall shew great signs and wonders; insomuch that, if it were possible, they shall deceive the very elect.
{% ct 'Matthew 24:11, 24' %}

Jesus said there will be many false prophets in the last days deceiving people with signs and wonders. The working of miracles, therefore, is not sufficient evidence of a genuine prophet {% rf 'Revelation 13:13-14; 16:14' %}. But it’s important to note that Jesus did not say that all prophets will be false ones. Since He warned about false ones, there must be genuine ones too.

## What false prophets are condemned in the Bible?

> There shall not be found among you anyone who makes his son or his daughter pass through the fire, or one *who practices witchcraft, or a soothsayer, or one who interprets omens, or a sorcerer, or one who conjures spells, or a medium, or a spiritist, or one who calls up the dead*. For all who do these things are an abomination to the Lord, and because of these abominations the Lord your God drives them out from before you
{% ct 'Deuteronomy 18:10-12, NKJV' %}

The Bible specifically names the following types of false prophets:
- One who practices witchcraft (fortune teller)
- Soothsayer (astrologer)
- One who interprets omens (uses charms)
- Sorcerer (claims to contact the spirits of the dead)
- One who conjures spells
- Medium (claims to channel the spirits of the dead)
- Spiritist (claims to talk to the dead)
- Witch (mentioned in KJV, a psychic)

The Bible clearly teaches that the dead cannot be contacted, and any supposed communication with the dead is an abomination to God because such communication is actually with evil spirits masquerading as the dead (see [“Are the Dead Really Dead?”](/posts/basics/death.md)).

## What else does the Bible say about prophets?

> Wherefore he saith, When he ascended up on high, he led captivity captive, and *gave gifts unto men*. ... And he gave some, apostles; and *some, prophets*; and some, evangelists; and some, pastors and teachers; *for the perfecting of the saints, for the work of the ministry, for the edifying of the body of Christ: till we all come in the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of God, unto a perfect man, unto the measure of the stature of the fulness of Christ*: that we henceforth be no more children, tossed to and fro, and carried about with every wind of doctrine, by the sleight of men, and cunning craftiness, whereby they lie in wait to deceive; but speaking the truth in love, may grow up into him in all things, which is the head, even Christ.
{% ct 'Ephesians 4:8, 11-15' %}

> Now ye are the body of Christ, and members in particular. And *God hath set some in the church*, first apostles, *secondarily prophets*, thirdly teachers, after that miracles, then gifts of healings, helps, governments, diversities of tongues.
{% ct '1 Corinthians 12:27-28' %}

While a prophet can at times edify the public, Paul tells us that prophecy is one of Jesus’ gifts to His church intended to edify its members in their Christian walk as well as to equip them in the work of ministry to others. These gifts are vital to His church and will remain with her until Jesus returns. But it’s also important to emphasize that while the gift of prophecy is a tremendous blessing, it’s not meant to add to, replace, or minimize the Word of God {% rf 'Revelation 22:18-19; Proverbs 30:5-6' %}. It’s true that God has used prophets to clarify His Word, but He never used them to originate new beliefs that cannot be supported by the Bible. The genuine gift of prophecy always elevates, and is in harmony with, God’s Word {% rf 'Matthew 4:4' %}.

## Why is the gift of prophecy absent from most churches?

> Her gates are sunk into the ground; he hath destroyed and broken her bars: her king and her princes are among the Gentiles: *the law is no more; her prophets also find no vision from the LORD*.
{% ct 'Lamentations 2:9' %}

When God’s people knowingly rebel against His holy law, He withdraws the prophetic gift because the gifts of the Spirit are for those who genuinely desire to live a life of complete surrender to Him—a life that’s in harmony with and in obedience to His teachings, summarized in His law {% rf 'Matthew 22:36-40' %}. This principle explains why God sent a prophet once His remnant church emerged in the 1800s that kept, and still keeps, all of His commandments, including the seventh-day Sabbath observed by Jesus (see [“God’s Rest Day”](/posts/basics/sabbath.md)). God also knows exactly when His people are in need of warning, counsel, and guidance, and when that time comes, He lovingly sends them a prophet to strengthen them {% rf 'Proverbs 29:18' %}.

## Who empowers prophets to speak on God’s behalf?

> But the *manifestation of the Spirit is given to every man to profit withal*. For to one is given by the Spirit the word of wisdom; to another the word of knowledge by the same Spirit; to another faith by the same Spirit; to another the gifts of healing by the same Spirit; to another the working of miracles; *to another prophecy*; to another discerning of spirits; to another divers kinds of tongues; to another the interpretation of tongues. But *all these worketh that one and the selfsame Spirit, dividing to every man severally as he will*.
{% ct '1 Corinthians 12:7-11' %}

> Knowing this first, that *no prophecy of the scripture is of any private interpretation*. For the prophecy came not in old time by the will of man: but *holy men of God spake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost*.
{% ct '2 Peter 1:20-21' %}

Jesus gives the gift of prophecy through the Holy Spirit, who distributes it to His people as He wills. In his second epistle, Peter tells us that it’s the Spirit who enables and empowers God’s prophets to speak on His behalf.

## Will the gift of prophecy be evident in the last days?

> And it shall come to pass afterward, that *I will pour out my spirit upon all flesh*; and your sons and your daughters shall *prophesy*, your old men shall *dream dreams*, your young men shall *see visions*. And also upon the servants and upon the handmaids in those days will I pour out my spirit.
{% ct 'Joel 2:28-29' %}

This prophecy was partially fulfilled when the Holy Spirit was poured out during Pentecost {% rf 'Acts 2:1-4' %}, empowering Jesus’ disciples to take the good news of His great sacrifice for sinners to the entire world. The prophecy will be fully fulfilled in the last days when the Holy Spirit empowers Christ’s followers to warn and prepare the world for His glorious return.

## Does the Bible give more evidence of this?

> And the dragon was wroth with the woman, and went to make war with the remnant of her seed, *which keep the commandments of God, and have the testimony of Jesus Christ*.
{% ct 'Revelation 12:17' %}

> And I fell at his feet to worship him. And he said unto me, See thou do it not: I am thy fellowservant, and of thy brethren that have the testimony of Jesus: worship God: for *the testimony of Jesus is the spirit of prophecy*.
{% ct 'Revelation 19:10' %}

The remnant of Revelation 12 is God’s church in the last days (see [“God’s Remnant Church”](/posts/prophecy/remnant.md)), and it has two characteristics: keeps God’s commandments and has the testimony of Jesus Christ, which, according to Revelation 19, is the spirit of prophecy. This is another clue that the gift of prophecy will be evident in the last days prior to Jesus’ return; in fact, it’s one of the identifying marks of the remnant church. Paul confirms this in {% rf '1 Corinthians 1:4-7' false %} where he says that the church waiting for His return will not lack any of the gifts of the Spirit. Just as God sent John the Baptist to prepare the world for Jesus’ first coming, He will send the gift of prophecy to His last-day commandment-keeping church to prepare the world (and itself) for Jesus’ second coming.

Incidentally, since the testimony of Jesus is the spirit of prophecy then the words of His prophets are special messages from Jesus to us. Bringing reproach upon His prophets is the same as bringing reproach upon Jesus because He is the One who sends them.

## What else does the Bible say about the gift of prophecy?

> And they rose early in the morning, and went forth into the wilderness of Tekoa: and as they went forth, Jehoshaphat stood and said, Hear me, O Judah, and ye inhabitants of Jerusalem; believe in the LORD your God, so shall ye be established; *believe his prophets, so shall ye prosper*.
{% ct '2 Chronicles 20:20' %}

> *Quench not the Spirit. Despise not prophesyings. Prove all things*; hold fast that which is good. Abstain from all appearance of evil.
{% ct '1 Thessalonians 5:19-22' %}

God has urged His people not to despise the gift of prophecy; in fact, He has pronounced a blessing on those who believe the words of His prophets. In an echo of Jesus’ warning about false prophets, Paul also tells us to test all things so that we can accurately discern whether a prophet is genuine or false.

## How does God speak to His prophets?

> And he said, Hear now my words: If there be a prophet among you, I the LORD will make myself known unto him *in a vision*, and will speak unto him *in a dream*.
{% ct 'Numbers 12:6' %}

> I speak with him *face to face*, Even plainly, and not in dark sayings; And he sees the form of the LORD. Why then were you not afraid To speak against My servant Moses?”
{% ct 'Numbers 12:8, NKJV' %}

God speaks to His prophets through visions, dreams, and face to face.

## What happens to the true prophet during a vision?

> And, behold, one like the similitude of the sons of men touched my lips: then *I opened my mouth, and spake*, and said unto him that stood before me, O my lord, by the vision my sorrows are turned upon me, and I have retained no strength. For how can the servant of this my lord talk with this my lord? for as for me, *straightway there remained no strength in me, neither is there breath left in me*. Then there came again and touched me one like the appearance of a man, and he strengthened me, and said, O man greatly beloved, fear not: peace be unto thee, be strong, yea, be strong. And *when he had spoken unto me, I was strengthened*, and said, Let my lord speak; for thou hast strengthened me.
{% ct 'Daniel 10:16-19' %}

> He hath said, which heard the words of God, which saw the vision of the Almighty, falling into a trance, but *having his eyes open*.
{% ct 'Numbers 24:4' %}

> It is not expedient for me doubtless to glory. I will come to visions and revelations of the Lord. I knew a man in Christ above fourteen years ago, (*whether in the body, I cannot tell; or whether out of the body, I cannot tell*: God knoweth;) such an one caught up to the third heaven. And I knew such a man, (whether in the body, or out of the body, I cannot tell: God knoweth;) How that he was caught up into paradise, and heard unspeakable words, which it is not lawful for a man to utter.
{% ct '2 Corinthians 12:1-4' %}

During a vision from God the true prophet will have the following physical characteristics, although they may not be present all at once:
- Initially losing physical strength {% rf 'Daniel 10:17' %}.
- Later receiving supernatural strength {% rf 'Daniel 10:18-19' %}.
- No breath in the body {% rf 'Daniel 10:17' %}.
- Able to speak {% rf 'Daniel 10:17' %}.
- Eyes wide open {% rf 'Numbers 24:4' %}.
- Not being aware of earthly surroundings {% rf '2 Corinthians 12:1-4' %}.

## What else happens to the genuine prophet?

> Also I heard the voice of the Lord, saying, Whom shall I send, and who will go for us? Then said I, Here am I; send me. And he said, *Go, and tell this people*, Hear ye indeed, but understand not; and see ye indeed, but perceive not.
{% ct 'Isaiah 6:8-9' %}

> Then the word of the LORD came unto me, saying, Before I formed thee in the belly I knew thee; and before thou camest forth out of the womb I sanctified thee, and *I ordained thee a prophet unto the nations*. Then said I, Ah, Lord GOD! behold, I cannot speak: for I am a child. But the LORD said unto me, Say not, I am a child: for *thou shalt go to all that I shall send thee, and whatsoever I command thee thou shalt speak*.
{% ct 'Jeremiah 1:4-7' %}

> Then answered Amos, and said to Amaziah, I was no prophet, neither was I a prophet's son; but I was an herdman, and a gatherer of sycomore fruit: and the LORD took me as I followed the flock, and the LORD said unto me, *Go, prophesy unto my people Israel*.
{% ct 'Amos 7:14-15' %}

A genuine prophet is called to service by God.

## What is another characteristic of a true prophet?

> If there arise among you a prophet, or a dreamer of dreams, and giveth thee a sign or a wonder, and the sign or the wonder come to pass, *whereof he spake unto thee, saying, Let us go after other gods, which thou hast not known, and let us serve them; thou shalt not hearken unto the words of that prophet*, or that dreamer of dreams: for the LORD your God proveth you, to know whether ye love the LORD your God with all your heart and with all your soul. *Ye shall walk after the LORD your God, and fear him, and keep his commandments, and obey his voice*, and ye shall serve him, and cleave unto him.
{% ct 'Deuteronomy 13:1-4' %}

> And when they shall say unto you, Seek unto them that have familiar spirits, and unto wizards that peep, and that mutter: should not a people seek unto their God? for the living to the dead? *To the law and to the testimony: if they speak not according to this word, it is because there is no light in them*.
{% ct 'Isaiah 8:19-20' %}

The true prophet will always speak in harmony with and obedience to God’s will as revealed in His Word and in His commandments. Anyone speaking contrary to God’s will cannot be His prophet.

## What other test does the Bible provide?

> The prophets that have been before me and before thee of old prophesied both against many countries, and against great kingdoms, of war, and of evil, and of pestilence. The prophet which prophesieth of peace, *when the word of the prophet shall come to pass, then shall the prophet be known, that the LORD hath truly sent him*.
{% ct 'Jeremiah 28:8-9' %}

The genuine prophet’s predictions always come to pass if they are not conditional.

## What is the fifth test?

> Beware of false prophets, which come to you in sheep’s clothing, but inwardly they are ravening wolves. *Ye shall know them by their fruits*. Do men gather grapes of thorns, or figs of thistles?
{% ct 'Matthew 7:15-16' %}

The life of a genuine prophet will reveal the character of Jesus and the fruits of the Spirit {% rf 'Galatians 5:22-23' %}.

## What is the final test?

> Beloved, believe not every spirit, but try the spirits whether they are of God: because many false prophets are gone out into the world. Hereby know ye the Spirit of God: *every spirit that confesseth that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh is of God, and every spirit that confesseth not that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh is not of God*: and this is that spirit of antichrist, whereof ye have heard that it should come; and even now already is it in the world.
{% ct '1 John 4:1-3' %}

> And I, *if I be lifted up* from the earth, *will draw all men unto me*.
{% ct 'John 12:32' %}

The true prophet will lift up Jesus Christ and emphasize His centrality in all teachings because it’s His love that draws people to Himself. Anyone who denies Jesus’ atoning sacrifice on the cross as being sufficient to pay for all sins is not from God.

## How is the gift of prophecy manifested in the last days?

In question eight we learned that the gift of prophecy will be evident in God’s remnant church, which emerged in the 1800s. In order to encourage the growing church, God called a young woman named Ellen Harmon, who later married and became Ellen White, and blessed her with the gift of prophecy, using her to instruct the church as it grew into a worldwide missionary movement. Her life, visions, and writings fulfilled every biblical test of a genuine prophet, and they are evidence that God is doing everything He can to ensure His people have all the encouragement they need in order to thrive in the closing moments of Earth’s history.

Even though Ellen had little formal education, she went on to write dozens of books on a variety of subjects, including the Bible, health, education, parenting, Christian living, evangelism, and more. Her writing is so impactful that she has become the fourth most translated author of all time. Her book on having a saving relationship with Jesus, *[Steps to Christ](https://m.egwwritings.org/en/book/108/toc)*, has been translated into more than 165 languages.

The best way to get acquainted with her prophetic gift is to read her material for yourself, and it will become evident that her primary goal was to direct people to Jesus as their personal Savior and to the Bible as their only rule of faith and life. Some of her other popular works include a book about the conflict between good and evil called *[The Great Controversy](https://m.egwwritings.org/en/book/132/toc)*, one about Christ’s famous sermon called *[Thoughts From the Mount of Blessing](https://m.egwwritings.org/en/book/150/toc)*, a book about His parables called *[Christ’s Object Lessons](https://m.egwwritings.org/en/book/15/toc)*, and a masterpiece about His life called *[The Desire of Ages](https://m.egwwritings.org/en/book/130/toc)*. Her writings are saturated with references to the Bible, which is elevated at every opportunity and never contradicted. Many who have read her works have been greatly blessed, realizing that she was used by God to communicate His love and truth, thereby leading many into a closer relationship with Him. It could be you if you give her a try.
