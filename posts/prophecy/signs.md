## What is the first sign Jesus mentions?

> And as he sat upon the mount of Olives, the disciples came unto him privately, saying, Tell us, when shall these things be? and what shall be the sign of thy coming, and of the end of the world? And Jesus answered and said unto them, *Take heed that no man deceive you. For many shall come in my name, saying, I am Christ; and shall deceive many*.
{% ct 'Matthew 24:3-5' %}

> For there *shall arise false Christs, and false prophets, and shall shew great signs and wonders*; insomuch that, if it were possible, they shall deceive the very elect.
{% ct 'Matthew 24:24' %}

> For such are false apostles, deceitful workers, transforming themselves into the apostles of Christ. And no marvel; for *Satan himself is transformed into an angel of light*.
{% ct '2 Corinthians 11:13-14' %}

Jesus emphasizes that deception will not only be prevalent in the lead-up to His coming, but also powerful, as it will be accompanied by signs and wonders. Beyond people claiming to be false Christs, Satan himself can appear as an angel of light. Jim Jones and David Koresh are examples of false prophets who claimed to be Christ, but the danger runs even deeper than that.

Over the past few decades, the New Age teachings of pantheism (all is God) and panentheism (God is in all) have been creeping into Christianity, leading some to believe that they are actually god. These teachings build upon the serpent’s original lie, “ye shall be as gods” {% rf 'Genesis 3:5' %}, and fulfill Christ’s prophecy that many would say, “I am Christ” {% rf 'Matthew 24:5' %}. Anyone who teaches that a human being can become god—or even Christ—spreads deception, because the truth is Jesus never promised us deity. He promised us eternal life {% rf 'Romans 6:23' %}, yes, but never deity. We are and will always be His created beings; He is our Creator God.

## What about spiritism?

> Now the Spirit speaketh expressly, that in the latter times some shall depart from the faith, *giving heed to seducing spirits*, and doctrines of devils.
{% ct '1 Timothy 4:1' %}

The interest in psychics, channelers, spiritists, and the occult is as old as time, but it will intensify in the final days of earth’s history. Surprisingly, these practices are alive in Christianity as well through the meditative techniques of spiritual formation, which allegedly enable the practitioner to come into God’s presence—and even hear His voice—on demand. This is achieved through an altered state of consciousness, known as “entering the silence,” in which all thinking is suppressed, resulting in a trance-like, meditative state—the same state that witches, psychics, and channelers enter when they do their work. When this state is reached, the mind is opened to the influence of evil supernatural forces. The truth is God never asks us to suspend our reasoning powers when we pray or study His Word; on the contrary, He wants us to be fully engaged {% rf 'Isaiah 1:18' %}. (For more information, see Howard Peth’s book *The Dangers of Contemplative Prayer*.)

## What is another sign?

> And ye shall hear of *wars and rumours of wars*: see that ye be not troubled: for all these things must come to pass, but the end is not yet. For nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom: and *there shall be famines, and pestilences, and earthquakes, in divers places*.
{% ct 'Matthew 24:6-7' %}

> All these are the *beginning of birth pains*.
{% ct 'Matthew 24:8, NIV' %}

While wars, rumors of wars, famines, epidemics, and earthquakes have always existed, Jesus likened them to birth pains—which increase in frequency and intensity over time—to emphasize that these signs will follow the same pattern.

## Is there a surprising sign in Revelation?

> And the nations were angry, and thy wrath is come, and the time of the dead, that they should be judged, and that thou shouldest give reward unto thy servants the prophets, and to the saints, and them that fear thy name, small and great; and *shouldest destroy them which destroy the earth*.
{% ct 'Revelation 11:18' %}

Humanity now possesses the power to destroy the earth—through weapons of mass destruction like the atomic bomb and by tampering with weather modification techniques like geoengineering.

## How will people feel about the future?

> *Men’s hearts failing them for fear*, and for looking after those things which are coming on the earth: for the powers of heaven shall be shaken.
{% ct 'Luke 21:26' %}

Those without God as their anchor will find themselves in a fearful and anxious state as the world becomes increasingly chaotic. Such a state, on a societal level, makes people easy to control and manipulate—a fertile ground for tyranny and scapegoat-seeking narratives, which can easily lead to previously unimaginable atrocities. The Bible predicts [this will happen](../prophecy/usa.md) just before Christ’s Second Coming.

## What sign does Paul give in one of his letters?

> For yourselves know perfectly that the day of the Lord so cometh as a thief in the night. *For when they shall say, Peace and safety; then sudden destruction cometh upon them*, as travail upon a woman with child; and they shall not escape.
{% ct '1 Thessalonians 5:2-3' %}

This is related to the previous sign of apprehension about the future, because as nations attempt to bring stability, they will make promises of peace and safety, but according to the Bible, the reality that follows will be the opposite.

## How will people treat each other?

> And because iniquity shall abound, the *love of many shall wax cold*.
{% ct 'Matthew 24:12' %}

> This know also, that in the last days perilous times shall come. For men shall be *lovers of their own selves, covetous, boasters, proud, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy, Without natural affection, trucebreakers, false accusers, incontinent, fierce, despisers of those that are good, traitors, heady, highminded, lovers of pleasures more than lovers of God; having a form of godliness, but denying the power thereof*: from such turn away.
{% ct '2 Timothy 3:1-5' %}

As the love of many grows cold, evil will begin to assert itself in the lives of those who have rejected God. When the restraining power of God departs through persistent rejection {% rf 'Romans 1:28' %}, human behavior will begin to resemble that of the pre-flood world, when every thought was only evil continually {% rf 'Genesis 6:5' %}. But this trend will not be universal. Communities of genuine followers of Christ will exist throughout the world who reflect His character. Specifically, they will be known for their love—which is, in fact, the love of God manifested in them {% rf 'John 13:35; 1 John 2:5' %}. Thus, in the end, there will be only two classes of people: those who give themselves over to sin, selfishness, and evil, and those who give themselves over to God’s loving mercy and enabling grace. Whether we realize it or not, the decisions we make on a daily basis are bringing us closer to one of these groups.

## What will people be preoccupied with?

> And take heed to yourselves, lest at any time your hearts be overcharged with *surfeiting, and drunkenness, and cares of this life*, and so that day come upon you unawares.
{% ct 'Luke 21:34' %}

> But *as the days of Noe were, so shall also the coming of the Son of man be*. For as in the days that were before the flood they were eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, until the day that Noe entered into the ark, and knew not until the flood came, and took them all away; so shall also the coming of the Son of man be.
{% ct 'Matthew 24:37-39' %}

Obviously, there is nothing wrong with marriage; after all, it was instituted and blessed by God Himself. Likewise, it is impossible to survive without nourishing our bodies; we must eat, which means we must work, and for the majority of people, work consumes the largest part of their lives. Most are busy trying to survive, so in the absence of intentionality, it is easy to become preoccupied with the temporal at the expense of the spiritual. Yet Christ’s words quietly ring in the background: “Seek ye first the kingdom of God, and his righteousness; and all these things shall be added unto you” {% rf 'Matthew 6:33' %}. In Noah’s days, most people ignored his invitations to come into the ark because they were too busy doing other things. Where do our priorities stand?

## Are there any socioeconomic signs?

> Go to now, ye rich men, weep and howl for your miseries that shall come upon you. *Your riches are corrupted*, and your garments are motheaten. Your gold and silver is cankered; and the rust of them shall be a witness against you, and shall eat your flesh as it were fire. Ye have heaped treasure together for the last days. Behold, the *hire of the labourers who have reaped down your fields, which is of you kept back by fraud, crieth*: and the cries of them which have reaped are entered into the ears of the Lord of sabaoth. Ye have lived in pleasure on the earth, and been wanton; ye have nourished your hearts, as in a day of slaughter.
{% ct 'James 5:1-5' %}

The gap between rich and poor, coupled with corruption, fraud, and disputes between employers and workers, will continue to widen as we draw nearer to the coming of Christ. As the Holy Spirit is repeatedly resisted and withdrawn, people are left to the control of their carnal nature, whose chief aim has always been preservation and exaltation of self.

## What is one of the positive signs?

> And *this gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world* for a witness unto all nations; and then shall the end come.
{% ct 'Matthew 24:14' %}

With the rapid advancement of communication technology over the past decades—such as television, radio, and the internet—the gospel is now being preached to even the remotest corners of the globe. What once seemed an impossible task has now become a reality. The Bible teaches that religious revivals—both [genuine](/posts/prophecy/usa.md#will-there-be-a-genuine-revival) and [counterfeit](/posts/prophecy/usa.md#will-there-be-a-false-religious-revival)—will spread across the world, and religious discussions will take center stage, resonating through the legislative halls and judicial courtrooms of nations just prior to Christ’s return. Religion in general, and the enforcement of God’s law in particular, will be on everyone’s mind.

## What is God’s desire for the human race?

> The Lord is not slack concerning his promise, as some men count slackness; but is *longsuffering to us-ward, not willing that any should perish, but that all should come to repentance*.
{% ct '2 Peter 3:9' %}

> Say unto them, As I live, saith the Lord GOD, *I have no pleasure in the death of the wicked*; but that the wicked turn from his way and live: *turn ye, turn ye from your evil ways; for why will ye die*, O house of Israel?
{% ct 'Ezekiel 33:11' %}

God does not want anyone to be caught off guard or unprepared for His coming. His desire is that every person be saved, so He is patient with us, granting repeated opportunities and every spiritual blessing {% rf 'Ephesians 1:3-4' %} we need to become His sons and daughters. Yet His patience is not infinite {% rf 'Genesis 6:3' %}, for if it were, the misery of sin would never end. One day, the door to reconciliation with our Maker will close forever. May it never be said of us: “The harvest is past, the summer is ended, and we are not saved” {% rf 'Jeremiah 8:20' %}. Let us make the most of every God-given opportunity and blessing.

## What advice and promise does the Bible give?

> *Watch therefore*: for ye know not what hour your Lord doth come. But know this, that if the goodman of the house had known in what watch the thief would come, he would have watched, and would not have suffered his house to be broken up. Therefore *be ye also ready*: for in such an hour as ye think not the Son of man cometh.
{% ct 'Matthew 24:42-44' %}

> Watch ye therefore, and *pray always*, that ye may be accounted worthy to escape all these things that shall come to pass, and to stand before the Son of man.
{% ct 'Luke 21:36' %}

> I will say of the LORD, *He is my refuge and my fortress: my God; in him will I trust*. Surely *he shall deliver thee* from the snare of the fowler, and from the noisome pestilence. He shall cover thee with his feathers, and under his wings shalt thou trust: *his truth shall be thy shield and buckler*.
{% ct 'Psalm 91:2-4' %}

Those who watch for the signs of Christ’s coming and earnestly pray that He will prepare them for it will experience His unfailing faithfulness and enabling grace. If received and obeyed, His truth will protect them from deception, and He will be with them every step of the way, no matter what happens around them.
