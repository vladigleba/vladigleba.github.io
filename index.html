            <h2>How much of the Bible is inspired by God? For what purpose?</h2>
            <p>
              <em>All</em> Scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable <em>for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness</em>, that the man of God may be complete, thoroughly equipped for every good work. <cite><b>2 Timothy 3:16, 17</b></cite>

            <h2>How did it maintain its miraculous unity?</h2>
            <p>
              Knowing this first, that no prophecy of Scripture is of any private interpretation, for prophecy never came by the will of man, but holy men of God spoke <em>as they were moved by the Holy Spirit</em>. <cite><b>2 Peter 1:20, 21</b></cite>
            </p>

            <h2>Can the Bible be trusted?</h2>
            <p>
              The entirety of Your word is <em>truth</em>, and every one of Your righteous judgments endures forever. <cite><b>Psalm 119:160</b></cite>

            <h2>But hasn’t it been corrupted over the ages?</h2>
            <p>
              The words of the Lord are <em>pure words</em>, like silver tried in a furnace of earth, purified seven times. You shall keep them, O Lord, You shall <em>preserve them</em> from this generation forever. <cite><b>Psalm 12:6, 7</b></cite>

            <div>5</div>
            <h2>Can God’s Word be changed or done away with?</h2>
            <p>
              Heaven and earth will pass away, but <em>My words will by no means pass away</em>. <cite><b>Matthew 24:35</b></cite>

            <h2>Why did God gave us the Scriptures?</h2>
            <p>
              For whatever things were written before were written for our learning, that we through the patience and comfort of the Scriptures might <em>have hope</em>. <cite><b>Romans 15:4</b></cite>

            <div>7</div>
            <h2>What is another crucial reason?</h2>
            <p>
              And that from childhood you have known the Holy Scriptures, which are able to make you wise for <em>salvation</em> through faith which is in Christ Jesus. <cite><b>2 Timothy 3:15</b></cite>
            </p>

            <div>8</div>
            <h2>Who do the Scriptures point me to?</h2>
            <p>
              You search the Scriptures, for in them you think you have eternal life; and these are they which <em>testify of Me</em>. <cite><b>John 5:39</b></cite>

            <h2>How can I be blessed by the Bible?</h2>
            <p>
              <em>Study</em> to shew thyself approved unto God, a workman that needeth not to be ashamed, rightly dividing the word of truth. <cite><b>2 Timothy 2:15, KJV</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              These were more noble than those in Thessalonica, in that they received the word with all readiness of mind, and <em>searched the scriptures daily</em>, whether those things were so. <cite><b>Acts 17:11, KJV</b></cite>

            <h2>Is God’s Word as important as physical food?</h2>
            <p>
              Man shall not live by bread alone, but by <em>every word that proceeds from the mouth of God</em>. <cite><b>Matthew 4:4</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              I have treasured the words of His mouth <em>more than my necessary food</em>. <cite><b>Job 23:12</b></cite>

            <div>11</div>
            <h2>Who did Jesus say will help me understand the Bible?</h2>
            <p>
              However, when He, the Spirit of truth, has come, <em>He will guide you into all truth</em>; for He will not speak on His own authority, but whatever He hears He will speak; and He will tell you things to come. <cite><b>John 16:13</b></cite>

          </section>
          <section>
            <div>12</div>
            <h2>Why should I ask for the Holy Spirit’s guidance?</h2>
            <p>
              These things we also speak, not in words which man’s wisdom teaches but which the Holy Spirit teaches, comparing spiritual things with spiritual. But the natural man does not receive the things of the Spirit of God, for they are foolishness to him; nor can he know them, because they are <em>spiritually discerned</em>. <cite><b>1 Corinthians 2:13</b></cite>

            <p>
              Whom will he teach knowledge? And whom will he make to understand the message? Those just weaned from milk? Those just drawn from the breasts? For precept must be upon precept, <em>precept upon precept, line upon line</em>, line upon line, <em>here a little, there a little</em>. <cite><b>Isaiah 28:9, 10</b></cite>

              <em>By the word of the Lord</em> the heavens were made, and all the host of them <em>by the breath of His mouth</em>. He gathers the waters of the sea together as a heap; He lays up the deep in storehouses. Let all the earth fear the Lord; let all the inhabitants of the world stand in awe of Him.

            <h2>How did evil originate?</h2>
            <p>
              The kingdom of heaven is like a man who sowed good seed in his field; but while men slept, <em>his enemy came and sowed tares among the wheat</em> and went his way. But when the grain had sprouted and produced a crop, then the tares also appeared. So the servants of the owner came and said to him, “Sir, did you not sow good seed in your field? How then does it have tares?” He said to them, “<em>An enemy has done this</em>.” The servants said to him, “Do you want us then to go and gather them up?” <cite><b>Matthew 13:24-28</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> God cannot be the originator of evil because that is contrary to His character of love. It was an enemy of God that was responsible for the birth of evil.

              How you are fallen from heaven, O <em>Lucifer</em>, son of the morning! <cite><b>Isaiah 14:12</b></cite>

            <h2>Was Lucifer perfect when God created him?</h2>
            <p>
              You were the seal of <em>perfection</em>, full of wisdom and perfect in beauty. You were in Eden, the garden of God; every precious stone was your covering: the sardius, topaz, and diamond, beryl, onyx, and jasper, sapphire, turquoise, and emerald with gold. The workmanship of your timbrels and pipes was prepared for you on the day you were created. <em>You were the anointed cherub who covers</em>; I established you; you were on the holy mountain of God; you walked back and forth in the midst of fiery stones. <em>You were perfect in your ways from the day you were created, till iniquity was found in you</em>. <cite><b>Ezekiel 28:12-15</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              The Lord reigneth; let the people tremble: <em>he sitteth between the cherubims</em>; let the earth be moved. <cite><b>Psalm 99:1, KJV</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> In Ezekiel 28 Lucifer is symbolized as the “prince of Tyre,” and we learn that he was created perfect. He was also a covering cherub, which means he had a high position in heaven and was next to God’s very presence. It’s unknown how long perfection existed in heaven, but eventually evil was born in Lucifer’s heart because all of God’s angels had freedom of choice. This is a risk God willingly took because genuine love cannot exist without a free will.

              By the abundance of your trading you became filled with violence within, and you sinned; therefore I cast you as a profane thing out of the mountain of God; and I destroyed you, O covering cherub, from the midst of the fiery stones. <em>Your heart was lifted up because of your beauty</em>; you corrupted your wisdom <em>for the sake of your splendor</em>; I cast you to the ground, I laid you before kings, that they might gaze at you. <cite><b>Ezekiel 28:16-17</b></cite>

            <p>
              How you are fallen from heaven, O Lucifer, son of the morning! How you are cut down to the ground, you who weakened the nations! For you have said in your heart: “I will ascend into heaven, <em>I will exalt my throne above the stars of God</em>; I will also sit on the mount of the congregation on the farthest sides of the north; I will ascend above the heights of the clouds, <em>I will be like the Most High</em>.” <cite><b>Isaiah 14:12-14</b></cite>

            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> Lucifer allowed his beauty to fill him with pride, and he started to envy God’s power, His throne, and the worship of the angels. Eventually, his goal was to unseat God.

            <h2>What did this lead to?</h2>
            <p>
              And <em>war broke out in heaven</em>: Michael and his angels fought with the dragon; and the dragon and his angels fought, but they did not prevail, <em>nor was a place found for them in heaven any longer</em>. <cite><b>Revelation 12:7-8</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              And He [Jesus] said to them, “<em>I saw Satan fall</em> like lightning <em>from heaven</em>.” <cite><b>Luke 10:18</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> Lucifer was able to convince other angels to join him in his rebellion, leading to war in heaven. God could have then destroyed him, but He did not want the remaining angels to worship Him out of fear, so He cast Lucifer out of heaven and gave him an opportunity to demonstrate what would be the result of sin and rebellion. Would it bring more prosperity and happiness than God’s form of government?

            <h2>What did God do next?</h2>
            <p>
              So <em>God created man in His own image</em>; in the image of God He created him; male and female He created them. Then God blessed them, and God said to them, “<em>Be fruitful and multiply</em>; fill the earth and subdue it; have dominion over the fish of the sea, over the birds of the air, and over every living thing that moves on the earth.”
            </p>
            <p>
              And God said, “See, I have given you every herb that yields seed which is on the face of all the earth, and every tree whose fruit yields seed; to you it shall be for food. Also, to every beast of the earth, to every bird of the air, and to everything that creeps on the earth, in which there is life, I have given every green herb for food”; and it was so. Then God saw everything that He had made, and indeed <em>it was very good</em>. So the evening and the morning were the sixth day. <cite><b>Genesis 1:27-31</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              Then the Lord God took the man and put him in the garden of Eden to tend and keep it. And the Lord God commanded the man, saying, “Of every tree of the garden you may freely eat; but <em>of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil you shall not eat</em>, for in the day that you eat of it you shall surely die.” <cite><b>Genesis 2:15-17</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> After losing some of His angels, God created a new order of beings after His own image. Adam and Eve were to be independent judges between the government of God and that of Satan since they did not witness the conflict in heaven. God gave them a perfect start, everything they needed for happiness and prosperity, but like His angels, they also had free will, and in order to be fair to Satan, God gave him access to them at the tree.

            <h2>What lie did Satan tell Eve that was an echo of Isaiah 14:14?</h2>
            <p>
              Now the serpent was more cunning than any beast of the field which the Lord God had made. And he said to the woman, “Has God indeed said, ‘You shall not eat of every tree of the garden’?” And the woman said to the serpent, “We may eat the fruit of the trees of the garden; but of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden, God has said, ‘You shall not eat it, nor shall you touch it, lest you die.’” Then the serpent said to the woman, “You will not surely die. For God knows that in the day you eat of it <em>your eyes will be opened, and you will be like God</em>, knowing good and evil.” <cite><b>Genesis 3:1-5</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> Satan used a serpent to deceive Eve and contradict God by telling her that not only would she not die if she ate the fruit, but she would also become like God, which is exactly what Satan himself desired in heaven. The implication was that God was holding her back from reaching her fullest potential, and Satan was actually the one who had her best interests in mind, not God.

            <h2>What happened instead?</h2>
            <p>
              So when the woman saw that the tree was good for food, that it was pleasant to the eyes, and a tree desirable to make one wise, she took of its fruit and ate. She also gave to her husband with her, and he ate. Then <em>the eyes of both of them were opened, and they knew that they were naked</em>; and they sewed fig leaves together and made themselves coverings. <cite><b>Genesis 3:6-7</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> In order to deceive Eve, Satan mixed in some truth with his lie when he said she would know good and evil because now that they had sinned against God, Adam and Eve lost their innocence, and their eyes were indeed opened to shame, grief, suffering, pain, and death, but they did not ascend to a higher state of existence, as Satan had promised. It was not God’s will for them to know evil, but because Adam and Eve had chosen to believe Satan’s version of reality, he was now free to proceed with establishing his form of government on Earth.

              And they heard the sound of the Lord God walking in the garden in the cool of the day, and Adam and his wife <em>hid themselves from the presence of the Lord God</em> among the trees of the garden. <cite><b>Genesis 3:8</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              Behold, the Lord’s hand is not shortened, that it cannot save; nor His ear heavy, that it cannot hear. But <em>your iniquities have separated you from your God</em>; and your sins have hidden His face from you, so that He will not hear. <cite><b>Isaiah 59:1, 2</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> As soon as Adam and Eve sinned, they hid from God for the first time. Sin leads to separation from God because sin cannot exist in the presence of a holy God without being consumed by it. A chasm was now formed between the Giver of life and His creation, and the process of death had commenced.

              Inasmuch then as the children have partaken of flesh and blood, He Himself likewise shared in the same, that <em>through death He might destroy him who had the power of death</em>, that is, the devil, and <em>release those who through fear of death were all their lifetime subject to bondage</em>. For indeed He does not give aid to angels, but He does give aid to the seed of Abraham. Therefore, in all things He had to be made like His brethren, that He might be a merciful and faithful High Priest in things pertaining to God, <em>to make propitiation for the sins of the people</em>.

              For if by the one man’s offense death reigned through the one, much more <em>those who receive abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness will reign in life through the One, Jesus Christ</em>. Therefore, as through one man’s offense judgment came to all men, resulting in condemnation, even so through one Man’s righteous act the <em>free gift came to all men, resulting in justification of life</em>. For as by one man’s disobedience many were made sinners, so also by one Man’s obedience many will be <em>made righteous</em>.
              <cite><b>Romans 5:17-19</b></cite>
            </p>

              Being justified freely by His grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus, whom God set forth as a propitiation by His blood, through faith, to demonstrate His righteousness, because in His forbearance <em>God had passed over the sins</em> that were previously committed.

              <em>For it is not an enemy who reproaches me</em>; then I could bear it. Nor is it one who hates me who has exalted himself against me; then I could hide from him. But it was you, a man my equal, <em>my companion and my acquaintance</em>. <cite><b>Psalm 55:12, 13</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              Even <em>my own familiar friend in whom I trusted, who ate my bread</em>, has lifted up his heel against me. <cite><b>Psalm 41:9</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              When Jesus had said these things, He was troubled in spirit, and testified and said, “Most assuredly, I say to you, <em>one of you will betray Me</em>.” Then the disciples looked at one another, perplexed about whom He spoke. &hellip; Jesus answered, “<em>It is he to whom I shall give a piece of bread</em> when I have dipped it.” And having dipped the bread, He gave it to Judas Iscariot, the son of Simon. <cite><b>John 13:21, 22, 26</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> Jesus was betrayed by a friend, one of His own disciples, and even the act that initiated the betrayal was accurately foretold&mdash;the eating of bread.

              Then I said to them, “If it is agreeable to you, give me my wages; and if not, refrain.” So they weighed out for my wages <em>thirty pieces of silver</em>. And the Lord said to me, “Throw it to the potter”&mdash;<em>that princely price they set on me</em>. So I took the thirty pieces of silver and <em>threw them into the house of the Lord for the potter</em>. <cite><b>Zechariah 11:12, 13</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              Then Judas, which had betrayed him, when he saw that he was condemned, repented himself, and brought again the <em>thirty pieces of silver</em> to the chief priests and elders, Saying, I have sinned in that I have betrayed the innocent blood. And they said, What is that to us? see thou to that. And <em>he cast down the pieces of silver in the temple</em>, and departed, and went and hanged himself. And the chief priests took the silver pieces, and said, It is not lawful for to put them into the treasury, because it is the price of blood. And they took counsel, and <em>bought with them the potter’s field</em>, to bury strangers in. <cite><b>Matthew 27:3-7, KJV</b></cite>

            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> Jesus was sold for thirty pieces of silver, the price of a slave, but Zechariah calls it a “princely price”&mdash;a clear reference to Jesus. However, not only was the amount accurately foretold, but also Judas’ act of throwing the money into the temple, as well as that money subsequently going to a potter!

All we like sheep have gone astray; we have turned every one to his own way; and the Lord hath laid on Him the iniquity of us all. <em>He was oppressed, and He was afflicted, yet He opened not His mouth</em>: He is brought as a lamb to the slaughter, and as a sheep before her shearers is dumb, so He openeth not His mouth. <cite><b>Isaiah 53:4-7, KJV</b></cite>

            </p>
            <p>
              Whosoever committeth sin transgresseth also the law: for <em>sin is the transgression of the law</em>. <cite><b>1 John 3:4, KJV</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> Sin started the process of decay and death on the earth that would affect not just Adam and Eve, but every other living thing on it. Death was now a part of life becase they were separated from the Giver of life. Furthermore, the Bible defines sin as the transgression of God’s law, and the penalty for breaking it is death.

            </p>
            <p>
              The king answered and said to the Chaldeans, “My decision is firm: if you do not make known the dream to me, and its interpretation, you shall be cut in pieces, and your houses shall be made an ash heap. However, if you tell the dream and its interpretation, you shall receive from me gifts, rewards, and great honor. Therefore tell me the dream and its interpretation.” They answered again and said, “Let the king tell his servants the dream, and we will give its interpretation.”

              The king answered and said, “I know for certain that you would gain time, because you see that my decision is firm: if you do not make known the dream to me, there is only one decree for you! For you have agreed to speak lying and corrupt words before me till the time has changed. Therefore tell me the dream, and I shall know that you can give me its interpretation.”
            </p>
            <p>
              The Chaldeans answered the king, and said, “There is not a man on earth who can tell the king’s matter; therefore no king, lord, or ruler has ever asked such things of any magician, astrologer, or Chaldean. <em>It is a difficult thing that the king requests, and there is no other who can tell it to the king except the gods</em>, whose dwelling is not with flesh.”

              Then the sky receded as a scroll when it is rolled up, and every mountain and island was moved out of its place. And the kings of the earth, the great men, the rich men, the commanders, the mighty men, every slave and every free man, <em>hid themselves</em> in the caves and in the rocks of the mountains, and said to the mountains and rocks, “<em>Fall on us and hide us from the face of Him who sits on the throne and from the wrath of the Lamb</em>! For the great day of His wrath has come, and who is able to stand?” <cite><b>Revelation 6:14-17</b></cite>

            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> Those who are left behind are destroyed by the brightness of His coming because any person who clings to sin cannot live in the presence of a holy God. To them His coming is a terrifying experience.

              He answered and said to them: “He who sows the good seed is the Son of Man. The field is the world, the good seeds are the sons of the kingdom, but the tares are the sons of the wicked one. The enemy who sowed them is the devil, the harvest is the end of the age, and the reapers are the angels. Therefore as the tares are gathered and burned in the fire, so it will be at the end of this age. The Son of Man will send out His angels, and <em>they will gather out of His kingdom all things that offend, and those who practice lawlessness</em>, and will cast them into the furnace of fire. There will be wailing and gnashing of teeth. Then the righteous will shine forth as the sun in the kingdom of their Father. He who has ears to hear, let him hear!” <cite><b>Matthew 13:37-43</b></cite>

            <h2>How does Revelation portray Jesus when He returns?</h2>
            <p>
              Now I saw heaven opened, and behold, a white horse. And He who sat on him was called Faithful and True, and in righteousness He judges and makes war. His eyes were like a flame of fire, and <em>on His head were many crowns</em>. He had a name written that no one knew except Himself. He was clothed with a robe dipped in blood, and His name is called The Word of God. And <em>the armies in heaven, clothed in fine linen, white and clean, followed Him</em> on white horses. Now out of His mouth goes a sharp sword, that with it He should strike the nations. And He Himself will rule them with a rod of iron. He Himself treads the winepress of the fierceness and wrath of Almighty God. And He has on His robe and on His thigh a name written: <em>KING OF KINGS AND LORD OF LORDS</em>. <cite><b>Revelation 19:11-16</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> Because He has won the war with Satan, Jesus comes back as a victorious King surrounded by His angelic army.

            <h2>What is the first sign Jesus mentions?</h2>
            <p>
              And as he sat upon the mount of Olives, the disciples came unto him privately, saying, Tell us, when shall these things be? and what shall be the sign of thy coming, and of the end of the world? And Jesus answered and said unto them, <em>Take heed that no man deceive you. For many shall come in my name, saying, I am Christ; and shall deceive many</em>. <cite><b>Matthew 24:3-5, KJV</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              For <em>false christs and false prophets will rise and show great signs and wonders to deceive</em>, if possible, even the elect. <cite><b>Matthew 24:24</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              For such are false apostles, deceitful workers, transforming themselves into apostles of Christ. And no wonder! For <em>Satan himself transforms himself into an angel of light</em>. <cite><b>2 Corinthians 11:13, 14</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> Jesus is emphasizing that deception will not only be prevelant in the lead-up to His coming, but it will also be powerful because it will be accompanied by signs and wonders. And it’s not just people who can pretend to be something they’re not, but Satan himself can appear as an angel of light.

              Now the Spirit expressly says that in latter times some will depart from the faith, <em>giving heed to deceiving spirits</em> and doctrines of demons. <cite><b>1 Timothy 4:1</b></cite>
            </p>

            <h2>What is another sign?</h2>
            <p>
              And you will hear of <em>wars and rumors of wars</em>. See that you are not troubled; for all these things must come to pass, but the end is not yet. For nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom. And <em>there will be famines, pestilences, and earthquakes in various places</em>. <cite><b>Matthew 24:6, 7</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              All these are the <em>beginning of birth pains</em>. <cite><b>Matthew 24:8, NIV</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> While wars, rumors of wars, famines, epidemics, and earthquakes have always been around, Jesus compares them to birth pains, which get more frequent and more intense with time.

              The nations were angry, and Your wrath has come, and the time of the dead, that they should be judged, and that You should reward Your servants the prophets and the saints, and those who fear Your name, small and great, and should <em>destroy those who destroy the earth</em>. <cite><b>Revelation 11:18</b></cite>

            <p>
              <em>Men’s hearts failing them from fear</em> and the expectation of those things which are coming on the earth, for the powers of the heavens will be shaken. <cite><b>Luke 21:26</b></cite>

            <h2>What sign does Paul give in one of his letters?</h2>
            <p>
              For you yourselves know perfectly that the day of the Lord so comes as a thief in the night. <em>For when they say, “Peace and safety!” then sudden destruction comes upon them</em>, as labor pains upon a pregnant woman. And they shall not escape. <cite><b>1 Thessalonians 5:2, 3</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> This is related to the previous sign of fear about the future because when there will be talk of peace and safety, the reality that follows will be the opposite.

            </p>
            <p>
              But know this, that in the last days perilous times will come: for men will be <em>lovers of themselves, lovers of money, boasters, proud, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy, unloving, unforgiving, slanderers, without self-control, brutal, despisers of good, traitors, headstrong, haughty, lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of God, having a form of godliness but denying its power</em>.

            <h2>What will people be preoccupied with?</h2>
            <p>
              But take heed to yourselves, lest your hearts be weighed down with <em>carousing, drunkenness, and cares of this life</em>, and that Day come on you unexpectedly. <cite><b>Luke 21:34</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              But <em>as the days of Noah were, so also will the coming of the Son of Man be</em>. For as in the days before the flood, they were eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, until the day that Noah entered the ark, and did not know until the flood came and took them all away, so also will the coming of the Son of Man be. <cite><b>Matthew 24:37-39</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> There’s nothing wrong with marriage as it was instituted and blessed by God, and it’s impossible to survive without nourishing our bodies. The point is in Noah’s days most people ignored him. Life is busy, and it’s easy to get preoccupied with temporal things and neglect spiritual things. Where do our own priorities stand?

              Come now, you rich, weep and howl for your miseries that are coming upon you! <em>Your riches are corrupted</em>, and your garments are moth-eaten. Your gold and silver are corroded, and their corrosion will be a witness against you and will eat your flesh like fire. You have heaped up treasure in the last days. Indeed <em>the wages of the laborers who mowed your fields, which you kept back by fraud, cry out</em>; and the cries of the reapers have reached the ears of the Lord of Sabaoth. You have lived on the earth in pleasure and luxury; you have fattened your hearts as in a day of slaughter. <cite><b>James 5:1-5</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> Rising wealth inequality and trouble between capital and labor will continue to be prominent until the coming of Christ.

            <h2>What advice and promise does the Bible give?</h2>
            <p>
              <em>Watch therefore</em>, for you do not know what hour your Lord is coming. But know this, that if the master of the house had known what hour the thief would come, he would have watched and not allowed his house to be broken into. Therefore you also <em>be ready</em>, for the Son of Man is coming at an hour you do not expect. <cite><b>Matthew 24:42-44</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              Watch therefore, and <em>pray always</em> that you may be counted worthy to escape all these things that will come to pass, and to stand before the Son of Man. <cite><b>Luke 21:36</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              I will say of the Lord, “<em>He is my refuge and my fortress; my God, in Him I will trust</em>.” Surely <em>He shall deliver you</em> from the snare of the fowler and from the perilous pestilence. He shall cover you with His feathers, and under His wings you shall take refuge; <em>His truth shall be your shield and buckler</em>. <cite><b>Psalm 91:2-4</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> Those who watch for signs of Christ’s coming and pray that He will help them to be ready to meet Him won’t be disappointed. His truth will protect them from deception, and God will be with them every step of the way, no matter what happens.

            <h2>Has the judgment already begun?</h2>
            <p>
              Then I saw another angel flying in the midst of heaven, having the everlasting gospel to preach to those who dwell on the earth&mdash;to every nation, tribe, tongue, and people&mdash;saying with a loud voice, “Fear God and give glory to Him, <em>for the hour of His judgment has come</em>; and worship Him who made heaven and earth, the sea and springs of water.” <cite><b>Revelation 14:6,7</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              And behold, I am coming quickly, and My reward is with Me, <em>to give to every one according to his work</em>. <cite><b>Revelation 22:12</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> In Revelation 14 there are three angels proclaiming a message to the people of the world in the last days, and the first angel’s message is that the judgment has begun. So the judgment begins in the last days, which we are living in. When Jesus comes back to Earth He’s bringing a reward with Him, which means the judgment has already taken place to decide who will be saved.

              I beheld till the thrones were cast down, and <em>the Ancient of Days did sit</em>, whose garment was white as snow, and the hair of his head like the pure wool: his throne was like the fiery flame, and his wheels as burning fire. A fiery stream issued and came forth from before him: thousand thousands ministered unto him, and ten thousand times ten thousand stood before him: the <em>judgment was set, and the books were opened</em>. <cite><b>Daniel 7:9, 10, KJV</b></cite>

            <p>
              So the great dragon was cast out, that serpent of old, called <em>the Devil and Satan</em>, who deceives the whole world; he was cast to the earth ... for <em>the accuser of our brethren</em>, who accused them before our God day and night, has been cast down. <cite><b>Revelation 12:9, 10</b></cite>

              <b>Note:</b> Evidence for the judgment comes from books containing every detail of a person’s life, including every sin. There is also a Book of Remembrance containing every kind word, unselfish act, or sacrifice made by those who follow Jesus as evidence of God’s transforming power in their lives. These people’s names are also written in the Book of Life.

            <h2>What is God’s standard in the judgment?</h2>
            <p>
              If you really fulfill the royal law according to the Scripture, “You shall love your neighbor as yourself,” you do well; but if you show partiality, you commit sin, and are <em>convicted by the law as transgressors</em>. For whoever shall keep the whole law, and yet stumble in one point, he is guilty of all. For He who said, “Do not commit adultery,” also said, “Do not murder.” Now if you do not commit adultery, but you do murder, you have become a transgressor of the law. So speak and so do as those who <em>will be judged by the law of liberty</em>. <cite><b>James 2:10-12</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              Whosoever committeth sin transgresseth also the law: for <em>sin is the transgression of the law</em>. <cite><b>1 John 3:4, KJV</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> If God keeps a record of our sins, and sin is the transgression of the law, then the Ten Commandment law is God’s standard by which we will be judged.

            <h2>How can my record of sin be blotted out?</h2>
            <p>
              <em>Repent ye therefore, and be converted, that your sins may be blotted out</em>, when the times of refreshing shall come from the presence of the Lord. <cite><b>Acts 3:19, KJV</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              Seek the Lord while He may be found, call upon Him while He is near. <em>Let the wicked forsake his way, and the unrighteous man his thoughts</em>; let him return to the Lord, and He will have mercy on him; and to our God, for <em>He will abundantly pardon</em>. <cite><b>Isaiah 55:6-7</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> Even though all have sinned (Romans 3:23), every person has hope of forgiveness! God the Father offers forgiveness to all who come to Him in repentance and forsaking of sin.

            <h2>What role does Jesus play in this?</h2>
            <p>
              But He, because He continues forever, has an unchangeable priesthood. Therefore He is also able to save to the uttermost those who come to God through Him, since <em>He always lives to make intercession for them</em>. <cite><b>Hebrews 7:24, 25</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              For we do not have a High Priest who cannot sympathize with our weaknesses, but was <em>in all points tempted as we are, yet without sin</em>. Let us therefore come boldly to the throne of grace, that we may obtain mercy and find grace to help in time of need. <cite><b>Hebrews 4:15-16</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> Because Jesus understands us and can sympathize with our weaknesses, He also intercedes on our behalf when we come to God through Him asking for forgiveness.

            <h2>What role does the Holy Spirit play?</h2>
            <p>
              Nevertheless I tell you the truth. It is to your advantage that I go away; for if I do not go away, the Helper will not come to you; but if I depart, I will send Him to you. And when He has come, <em>He will convict the world of sin</em>, and of righteousness, and of judgment. <cite><b>John 16:7, 8</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              But the Helper, the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in My name, He will teach you all things, and <em>bring to your remembrance</em> all things that I said to you. <cite><b>John 14:26</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> The Holy Spirit plays a crucial role as well by convicting us of sin and bringing to remembrance sins we have not confessed yet so there isn’t a single unconfessed sin left in our heavenly record for Satan to point to as a witness against us in the judgment.

            <h2>What happens to those whose record of sin has been removed?</h2>
            <p>
              There is therefore now <em>no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus</em>, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit. For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus hath made me free from the law of sin and death. For what the law could not do, in that it was weak through the flesh, God sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh, and for sin, condemned sin in the flesh: <em>that the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit</em>. <cite><b>Romans 8:1-4, KJV</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              He who overcomes shall be <em>clothed in white garments</em>, and I will <em>not blot out his name from the Book of Life</em>; but I will confess his name before My Father and before His angels. <cite><b>Revelation 3:5</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              Nevertheless do not rejoice in this, that the spirits are subject to you, but rather <em>rejoice because your names are written in heaven</em>. <cite><b>Luke 10:20</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> Those whose record of sin has been blotted out are no longer under condemnation because they have been forgiven through Christ, who paid the penalty for their sin on the cross. The law can now be fulfilled in them through the enabling power of the Spirit, and their names will not be blotted out from the Book of Life!

            <h2>What did Felix do when he was convicted?</h2>
            <p>
              Now as he reasoned about righteousness, self-control, and the judgment to come, Felix was afraid and answered, “<em>Go away for now; when I have a convenient time I will call for you</em>.” <cite><b>Acts 24:25</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              For He says: “In an acceptable time I have heard you, and in the day of salvation I have helped you.” Behold, now is the accepted time; behold, <em>now is the day of salvation</em>. <cite><b>2 Corinthians 6:2</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> When the Holy Spirit convicts it is not wise to ignore it or put it off to a more convenient time because that time may never come. Tomorrow is not guaranteed; we only have today. Today is the day to get right with God.
