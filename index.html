              Know ye not, that to whom ye yield yourselves servants to obey, <em>his servants ye are to whom ye obey</em>; whether of sin unto death, or of obedience unto righteousness? <cite>Romans 6:16, KJV</cite>

              Inasmuch then as the children have partaken of flesh and blood, He Himself likewise shared in the same, that <em>through death He might destroy him who had the power of death</em>, that is, the devil, and release those who through fear of death were all their lifetime subject to bondage. For indeed He does not give aid to angels, but He does give aid to the seed of Abraham. Therefore, in all things He had to be made like His brethren, that He might be a merciful and faithful High Priest in things pertaining to God, <em>to make propitiation for the sins of the people</em>. <cite>Hebrews 2:14-17</cite>

              For if by the one man’s offense death reigned through the one, much more those who receive abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness will reign in life through the One, Jesus Christ. Therefore, as through one man’s offense judgment came to all men, resulting in condemnation, even so through one Man’s righteous act <em>the free gift came to all men, resulting in justification of life</em>. For as by one man’s disobedience many were made sinners, so also <em>by one Man’s obedience many will be made righteous</em>. <cite>Romans 5:17-19</cite>

              Being justified freely by His grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus, whom God set forth as a propitiation by His blood, through faith, to demonstrate His righteousness, because <em>in His forbearance God had passed over the sins</em> that were previously committed. <cite>Romans 3:24, 25</cite>

              Your heart was lifted up because of your beauty; you corrupted your wisdom for the sake of your splendor; I cast you to the ground, I laid you before kings, that they might gaze at you. You defiled your sanctuaries by the multitude of your iniquities, by the iniquity of your trading; therefore <em>I brought fire from your midst; it devoured you, and I turned you to ashes</em> upon the earth in the sight of all who saw you. <cite>Ezekiel 28:17, 18</cite>

              Now I saw <em>a new heaven and a new earth</em>, for the first heaven and the first earth had passed away. Also there was no more sea. Then I, John, saw the holy city, New Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband. And I heard a loud voice from heaven saying, “Behold, the tabernacle of God is with men, and He will dwell with them, and they shall be His people. <em>God Himself will be with them and be their God</em>. And God will wipe away every tear from their eyes; there shall be <em>no more death, nor sorrow, nor crying</em>. There shall be <em>no more pain, for the former things have passed away</em>.” Then He who sat on the throne said, “Behold, I make all things new.” And He said to me, “Write, for these words are true and faithful.” <cite>Revelation 21:1-5</cite>
