            <h2>How much of the Bible is inspired by God? For what purpose?</h2>
            <p>
              <em>All</em> Scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable <em>for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness</em>, that the man of God may be perfect, throughly furnished unto all good works. <cite><b>2 Timothy 3:16, 17</b></cite>
            </p>
          </section>

            <div>2</div>
            <h2>How did it maintain its miraculous unity?</h2>
            <p>
              Knowing this first, that no prophecy of the scripture is of any private interpretation. For the prophecy came not in old time by the will of man: but holy men of God spake <em>as they were moved by the Holy Ghost</em>. <cite><b>2 Peter 1:20, 21</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> The Bible was written over a period of 1,500 years by about 40 different authors whose education and background varied greatly. The Bible’s unity under these circumstances is astonishing and can only be explained by divine inspiration.

            <p>
              <em>Thy word is true from the beginning</em>, and every one of thy righteous judgments endureth for ever. <cite><b>Psalm 119:160</b></cite>

            <h2>But hasn’t it been corrupted over the ages?</h2>
            <p>

              The words of the LORD are <em>pure words</em>, as silver tried in a furnace of earth, purified seven times. Thou shalt keep them, O LORD, thou shalt <em>preserve them</em> from this generation for ever. <cite><b>Psalm 12:6, 7</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> God’s word is truth, and He will ensure it stays that way.

            <h2>Can God’s Word be changed or done away with?</h2>
            <p>
              Heaven and earth shall pass away, but <em>my words shall not pass away</em>. <cite><b>Matthew 24:35</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              For all flesh is as grass, and all the glory of man as the flower of grass. The grass withereth, and the flower thereof falleth away: but <em>the word of the LORD endureth for ever</em>. And this is the word which by the gospel is preached unto you. <cite><b>1 Peter 1:24, 25</b></cite>

            <h2>Why did God give us the Scriptures?</h2>
            <p>
              For whatsoever things were written aforetime were written <em>for our learning</em>, that we through patience and comfort of the scriptures <em>might have hope</em>. <cite><b>Romans 15:4</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              For this is good and acceptable in the sight of God our Savior, <em>who will have all men to be saved, and to come unto the knowledge of the truth</em>. <cite><b>1 Timothy 2:3, 4</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              And that from a child thou hast known the holy scriptures, which are able <em>to make thee wise unto salvation</em> through faith which is in Christ Jesus. <cite><b>2 Timothy 3:15</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> God gave us the Scriptures so we can learn about His character and be grounded in His truth while navigating a world of deception, so that through it we might be saved from sin and have hope of eternal life.

            <h2>Who do the Scriptures point me to?</h2>
            <p>
              Search the scriptures; for in them ye think ye have eternal life: and they are they which <em>testify of me</em>. <cite><b>John 5:39</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              Looking unto Jesus the <em>author and finisher of our faith</em>; who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross, despising the shame, and is set down at the right hand of the throne of God. <cite><b>Hebrews 12:2</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              Jesus saith unto him, <em>I am the way, the truth, and the life</em>: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me. <cite><b>John 14:6</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> All the stories of the Bible point me to Jesus, the Author and Finisher of my faith.

            <h2>How can I be blessed by the Bible?</h2>
            <p>
              <em>Study</em> to shew thyself approved unto God, a workman that needeth not to be ashamed, rightly dividing the word of truth. <cite><b>2 Timothy 2:15</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              These were more noble than those in Thessalonica, in that they received the word with all readiness of mind, and <em>searched the scriptures daily</em>, whether those things were so. <cite><b>Acts 17:11</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> The Bible is unlike any other book because it is my Creator and Redeemer’s special gift to me. He speaks to me through it, and it is my privilege to read it daily because by doing so I’ll draw closer to Him. Every relationship is built on spending quality time together, and my relationship with Jesus is no different.

            <h2>Is God’s Word as important as physical food?</h2>
            <p>
              But he answered and said, It is written, Man shall not live by bread alone, but by <em>every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God</em>. <cite><b>Matthew 4:4</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              Neither have I gone back from the commandment of his lips; I have esteemed the words of his mouth <em>more than my necessary food</em>. <cite><b>Job 23:12</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that believeth on me hath everlasting life. <em>I am that bread of life</em>. Your fathers did eat manna in the wilderness, and are dead. This is the bread which cometh down from heaven, that a man may eat thereof, and not die. I am the living bread which came down from heaven: <em>if any man eat of this bread, he shall live for ever</em>: and the bread that I will give is my flesh, which I will give for the life of the world. <cite><b>John 6:47-51</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> Jesus is the spiritual bread that brings everlasting life, and we “eat” it whenever we read His Word. Our need for Him is actually greater than our need for physical food.

            <h2>Who did Jesus say will help me understand the Bible?</h2>
            <p>
              Howbeit when he, <em>the Spirit of truth</em>, is come, he <em>will guide you into all truth</em>: for he shall not speak of himself; but whatsoever he shall hear, that shall he speak: and he will shew you things to come. <cite><b>John 16:13</b></cite>

            <div>11</div>
            <h2>Why should I ask for the Holy Spirit’s guidance?</h2>
            <p>
              Which things also we speak, not in the words which man's wisdom teacheth, but which the Holy Ghost teacheth; comparing spiritual things with spiritual. But the natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God: for they are foolishness unto him: neither can he know them, <em>because they are spiritually discerned</em>. <cite><b>1 Corinthians 2:13, 14</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> Because spiritual things are spiritually discerned and because the Bible is full of stories with symbolism that goes multiple levels deep, I need the Holy Spirit to open my spiritual eyes and help me bring these stories to life. Humility and a teachable attitude is also a crucial part of it.

            <h2>How should I study the Bible?</h2>
            <p>
              Whom shall he teach knowledge? and whom shall he make to understand doctrine? them that are weaned from the milk, and drawn from the breasts. For precept must be upon precept, <em>precept upon precept; line upon line</em>, line upon line; <em>here a little, and there a little</em>. <cite><b>Isaiah 28:9, 10</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> God is not a God of contradiction or confusion, so it’s important to not take verses out of context and build a doctrine based on a verse or two. When studying a particular topic, it’s critical to identify as many verses as possible dealing with the topic and to let the Bible clarify itself on what seem, due to our misunderstanding, like contradictory ones.
            </p>

            <h2>What will the truth in God’s Word do to me?</h2>
            <p>
              <em>Sanctify them</em> through thy truth: thy word is truth. <cite><b>John 17:17</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              But we all, with open face <em>beholding as in a glass the glory of the LORD, are changed into the same image</em> from glory to glory, even as by the Spirit of the LORD. <cite><b>2 Corinthians 3:18</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              For <em>the word of God is living and powerful</em>, and sharper than any two-edged sword, piercing even to the division of soul and spirit, and of joints and marrow, and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart. <cite><b>Hebrews 4:12, NKJV</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> Reading the Bible brings me into contact with God’s divine mind and holy character, and by beholding it daily, I become more like Him through the work of the Holy Spirit. There is a reason the book of Hebrews calls the word of God living and powerful!

            <p class="note">

            </p>
            <p>
              I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the ending, saith the LORD, <em>which is, and which was, and which is to come</em>, the Almighty. <cite><b>Revelation 1:8</b></cite>

              Remember the former things of old: for I am God, and there is none else; I am God, and there is none like me, <em>declaring the end from the beginning</em>, and from ancient times the things that are not yet done, saying, My counsel shall stand, and I will do all my pleasure. <cite><b>Isaiah 46:9, 10</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              My frame was not hidden from You, when I was made in secret, and skillfully wrought in the lowest parts of the earth. Your eyes saw my substance, being yet unformed. And <em>in Your book they all were written, the days fashioned for me, when as yet there were none of them</em>. <cite><b>Psalm 139:15, 16, NKJV</b></cite>
            </p>

But when the blade was sprung up, and brought forth fruit, then appeared the tares also. So the servants of the householder came and said unto him, Sir, didst not thou sow good seed in thy field? from whence then hath it tares? He said unto them, <em>An enemy hath done this</em>. <cite><b>Matthew 13:24-28</b></cite>

            <h2>Was Lucifer perfect when God created him?</h2>
            <p>
              Thou sealest up the sum, full of wisdom, and perfect in beauty. Thou hast been in Eden the garden of God; every precious stone was thy covering, the sardius, topaz, and the diamond, the beryl, the onyx, and the jasper, the sapphire, the emerald, and the carbuncle, and gold: the workmanship of thy tabrets and of thy pipes was prepared in thee in the day that thou wast created. <em>Thou art the anointed cherub that covereth</em>; and I have set thee so: thou wast upon the holy mountain of God; thou hast walked up and down in the midst of the stones of fire. <em>Thou wast perfect in thy ways from the day that thou wast created, till iniquity was found in thee</em>. <cite><b>Ezekiel 28:12-15</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              The Lord reigneth; let the people tremble: <em>he sitteth between the cherubims</em>; let the earth be moved. <cite><b>Psalm 99:1</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> In Ezekiel 28 Lucifer is symbolized as the “prince of Tyre,” and we learn that he was created perfect. He was also a covering cherub, which means he had a high position in heaven and was next to God’s very presence. It’s unknown how long perfection existed in heaven, but eventually evil was born in Lucifer’s heart because he aall of God’s angels had freedom of choice. This is a risk God willingly took because genuine love cannot exist without a free will.

            </p>
            <p>
              How art thou fallen from heaven, O Lucifer, son of the morning! how art thou cut down to the ground, which didst weaken the nations! For thou hast said in thine heart, I will ascend into heaven, <em>I will exalt my throne above the stars of God</em>: I will sit also upon the mount of the congregation, in the sides of the north: I will ascend above the heights of the clouds; <em>I will be like the most High</em>. <cite><b>Isaiah 14:12-14</b></cite>

              <b>Note:</b> Lucifer was able to convince other angels to join him in his rebellion, leading to war in heaven.

Would it bring more prosperity and happiness than God’s form of government?

            <p>
              So <em>God created man in his own image</em>, in the image of God created he him; male and female created he them. And God blessed them, and God said unto them, <em>Be fruitful, and multiply</em>, and replenish the earth, and subdue it: and have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth.
              <br><br>
              And God said, Behold, I have given you every herb bearing seed, which is upon the face of all the earth, and every tree, in the which is the fruit of a tree yielding seed; to you it shall be for meat. And to every beast of the earth, and to every fowl of the air, and to every thing that creepeth upon the earth, wherein there is life, I have given every green herb for meat: and it was so. And God saw every thing that he had made, and, behold, <em>it was very good</em>. And the evening and the morning were the sixth day. <cite><b>Genesis 1:27-31</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              And the LORD God took the man, and put him into the garden of Eden to dress it and to keep it. And the LORD God commanded the man, saying, Of every tree of the garden thou mayest freely eat: But <em>of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not eat of it</em>: for in the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die. <cite><b>Genesis 2:15-17</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> After losing some of His angels, God created a new order of beings after His own image. Adam and Eve were to be independent judges between the government of God and that of Satan since they did not witness the conflict in heaven. God gave them a perfect start, everything they needed for happiness and prosperity, but like His angels, they also had free will, and in order to be fair to Satan, God gave him access to them at the tree.

            <p>
              Now the serpent was more subtil than any beast of the field which the LORD God had made. And he said unto the woman, Yea, hath God said, Ye shall not eat of every tree of the garden? And the woman said unto the serpent, We may eat of the fruit of the trees of the garden: But of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden, God hath said, Ye shall not eat of it, neither shall ye touch it, lest ye die. And the serpent said unto the woman, Ye shall not surely die: For God doth know that in the day ye eat thereof, then <em>your eyes shall be opened, and ye shall be as gods, knowing good and evil</em>. <cite><b>Genesis 3:1-5</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> Satan used a serpent to deceive Eve and contradict God by telling her that not only would she not die if she ate the fruit, but she would also become like God, which is exactly what Satan himself desired in heaven. The implication was that God was holding her back from reaching her fullest potential, and Satan was actually the one who had her best interests in mind, not God.

            <p>
              And when the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that it was pleasant to the eyes, and a tree to be desired to make one wise, she took of the fruit thereof, and did eat, and gave also unto her husband with her; and he did eat. And <em>the eyes of them both were opened, and they knew that they were naked</em>; and they sewed fig leaves together, and made themselves aprons. <cite><b>Genesis 3:6-7</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> In order to deceive Eve, Satan mixed in some truth with his lie when he said she would know good and evil because now that they had sinned against God, Adam and Eve lost their innocence, and their eyes were indeed opened to shame, grief, suffering, pain, and death, but they did not ascend to a higher state of existence, as Satan had promised. It was not God’s will for them to know evil, but because Adam and Eve had chosen to believe Satan’s version of reality, he was now free to proceed with establishing his form of government on Earth.

            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> As soon as Adam and Eve sinned, they hid from God for the first time.

            <h2>How can I go from death to justification of life?</h2>
            <p>
              For if by one man's offence death reigned by one; much more <em>they which receive abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness shall reign in life by one, Jesus Christ</em>. Therefore as by the offence of one judgment came upon all men to condemnation; even so by the righteousness of one the <em>free gift came upon all men unto justification of life</em>. For as by one man's disobedience many were made sinners, so <em>by the obedience of one shall many be made righteous</em>. <cite><b>Romans 5:17-19</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              Being justified freely by his grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus: Whom God hath set forth to be a propitiation through faith in his blood, <em>to declare his righteousness for the remission of sins</em> that are past, through the forbearance of God. <cite><b>Romans 3:24, 25</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> Christ’s perfect life gives us the ability to be free from the bondage of sin and it’s penalty of death! By paying for our sins, Jesus made it possible for anyone who receives this free gift by faith through repentance of sins to be forgiven and declared righteous before God!

              And now, O Father, <em>glorify thou me with thine own self with the glory which I had with thee before the world was</em>. &hellip; Father, I will that they also, whom thou hast given me, be with me where I am; <em>that they may behold my glory, which thou hast given me</em>: for thou lovedst me before the foundation of the world. <cite><b>John 17:5, 24</b></cite>

            <h2>Why is this claim significant?</h2>
            <p>
              And <em>God</em> said unto Moses, “<em>I AM THAT I AM</em>”: and he said, “Thus shalt thou say unto the children of Israel, ‘<em>I AM hath sent me unto you</em>.’” <cite><b>Exodus 3:14</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> Jesus used this expression to reveal Himself to Moses as “the Self-existing One.” It mirrors another of God’s names, Yahweh, which comes from a Hebrew word meaning “to be” or “to exist.” He’s telling Moses that He has no beginning or end.

Wherefore God also hath highly exalted him, and given him a name which is above every name: that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of things in heaven, and things in earth, and things under the earth; and that <em>every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord</em>, to the glory of God the Father.

And <em>God blessed them</em>, and God said unto them, Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it: and have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth. And God said, Behold, I have given you every herb bearing seed, which is upon the face of all the earth, and every tree, in the which is the fruit of a tree yielding seed; to you it shall be for meat. And to every beast of the earth, and to every fowl of the air, and to every thing that creepeth upon the earth, wherein there is life, I have given every green herb for meat: and it was so. And <em>God saw every thing that he had made, and, behold, it was very good</em>. And the evening and the morning were the sixth day. <cite><b>Genesis 1:27-31</b></cite>

              <b>Note:</b> Sin started the process of decay and death on the earth that would affect not just Adam and Eve, but every other living thing on it. Death was now a part of life becase they were separated from the Giver of life. Furthermore, the Bible defines sin as the transgression of God’s law, and the penalty for breaking it is death.

              <b>Note:</b> Forsaking my way implies turning around and going in the opposite direction. I go from running away from God toward sin to running away from sin toward God. If I repent and have a desire to leave my sins behind, the promise is I will receive forgiveness.

              Then the <em>king commanded to call the magicians, and the astrologers, and the sorcerers, and the Chaldeans, for to shew the king his dreams</em>. So they came and stood before the king. And the king said unto them, I have dreamed a dream, and my spirit was troubled to know the dream. Then spake the Chaldeans to the king in Syriack, O king, live for ever: tell thy servants the dream, and we will shew the interpretation.
              <br><br>
              The king answered and said to the Chaldeans, The thing is gone from me: if ye will not make known unto me the dream, with the interpretation thereof, ye shall be cut in pieces, and your houses shall be made a dunghill. But if ye shew the dream, and the interpretation thereof, ye shall receive of me gifts and rewards and great honour: therefore shew me the dream, and the interpretation thereof. They answered again and said, Let the king tell his servants the dream, and we will shew the interpretation of it.
              <br><br>
              The king answered and said, I know of certainty that ye would gain the time, because ye see the thing is gone from me. But if ye will not make known unto me the dream, there is but one decree for you: for ye have prepared lying and corrupt words to speak before me, till the time be changed: therefore tell me the dream, and I shall know that ye can shew me the interpretation thereof.
              <br><br>
              The Chaldeans answered before the king, and said, There is not a man upon the earth that can shew the king's matter: therefore there is no king, lord, nor ruler, that asked such things at any magician, or astrologer, or Chaldean. And <em>it is a rare thing that the king requireth, and there is none other that can shew it before the king, except the gods</em>, whose dwelling is not with flesh.

            <h2>According to Daniel 8, what kingdom is this?</h2>
            <p>
              The ram which thou sawest having two horns are the kings of Media and Persia. And the rough goat is the <em>king of Grecia</em>: and the great horn that is between his eyes is the first king. <cite><b>Daniel 8:20, 21</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> Alexander the Great conquered the Medes and Persians at the battle of Arbela in 331 B.C., which made the brass kingdom of Greece the next dominant world power. The armor of the Greek soldiers was all bronze.

            <h2>How is the fourth kingdom described?</h2>
            <p>
              And the fourth kingdom shall be <em>strong as iron</em>: forasmuch as iron breaketh in pieces and subdueth all things: and as iron that breaketh all these, shall it break in pieces and bruise. <cite><b>Daniel 2:40</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
               <b>Note:</b> The iron monarchy of Rome conquered the Greeks in 168 B.C. and was the world power when Jesus was born. The legs of iron are a fitting symbol as its long reign of over 600 years resulted in much persecution of God’s people.

            <h2>What kind of kingdom did the feet and toes represent?</h2>
            <p>
              And whereas thou sawest the feet and toes, part of potters' clay, and part of iron, the <em>kingdom shall be divided</em>; but there shall be in it of the strength of the iron, forasmuch as thou sawest the iron mixed with miry clay. And as the toes of the feet were part of iron, and part of clay, so the <em>kingdom shall be partly strong, and partly broken</em>. <cite><b>Daniel 2:41, 42</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> After the Roman empire crumled in A.D. 476, it was divided by barbarian tribes into numerous kingdoms symbolized by the toes on the image, seven of which exist today: the Ostrogoths (gone), Visigoths (Spain), Franks (France), Vandals (gone), Alemannians (Germany), Sueves (Portugal), Anglo-Saxons (England), Heruli (gone), and Lombards (Italy). The toes being partly of iron and partly of clay means some would be stronger than others.

              And in the days of these kings shall the God of heaven set up <em>a kingdom, which shall never be destroyed</em>: and the kingdom shall not be left to other people, but it shall break in pieces and consume all these kingdoms, and <em>it shall stand for ever</em>. Forasmuch as thou sawest that the stone was cut out of the mountain without hands, and that it brake in pieces the iron, the brass, the clay, the silver, and the gold; the great God hath made known to the king what shall come to pass hereafter: and the dream is certain, and the interpretation thereof sure. <cite><b>Daniel 2:44-45</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> The stone cut without hands represents the kingdom of heaven, which will replace all the earthly kingdoms at the coming of Christ, and His reign will have no end. Since the stone strikes the image’s feet, Jesus will come during the time of the divided nations.

His eyes were as a flame of fire, and <em>on his head were many crowns</em>; and he had a name written, that no man knew, but he himself. And he was clothed with a vesture dipped in blood: and his name is called The Word of God. And <em>the armies which were in heaven followed him upon white horses</em>, clothed in fine linen, white and clean. And out of his mouth goeth a sharp sword, that with it he should smite the nations: and he shall rule them with a rod of iron: and he treadeth the winepress of the fierceness and wrath of Almighty God. And he hath on his vesture and on his thigh a name written, <em>KING OF KINGS, AND LORD OF LORDS</em>. <cite><b>Revelation 19:11-16</b></cite>

            <h2>What is the first sign Jesus mentions?</h2>
            <p>
              And as he sat upon the mount of Olives, the disciples came unto him privately, saying, Tell us, when shall these things be? and what shall be the sign of thy coming, and of the end of the world? And Jesus answered and said unto them, <em>Take heed that no man deceive you. For many shall come in my name, saying, I am Christ; and shall deceive many</em>. <cite><b>Matthew 24:3-5</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              For there <em>shall arise false Christs, and false prophets, and shall shew great signs and wonders</em>; insomuch that, if it were possible, they shall deceive the very elect. <cite><b>Matthew 24:24</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              For such are false apostles, deceitful workers, transforming themselves into the apostles of Christ. And no marvel; for <em>Satan himself is transformed into an angel of light</em>. <cite><b>2 Corinthians 11:13, 14</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> Jesus is emphasizing that deception will not only be prevelant in the lead-up to His coming, but it will also be powerful because it will be accompanied by signs and wonders. And it’s not just people who can pretend to be something they’re not, but Satan himself can appear as an angel of light.

              And because iniquity shall abound, the <em>love of many shall wax cold</em>. <cite><b>Matthew 24:12</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              This know also, that in the last days perilous times shall come. For men shall be <em>lovers of their own selves, covetous, boasters, proud, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy, Without natural affection, trucebreakers, false accusers, incontinent, fierce, despisers of those that are good, traitors, heady, highminded, lovers of pleasures more than lovers of God; having a form of godliness, but denying the power thereof</em>: from such turn away. <cite><b>2 Timothy 3:1-5</b></cite>

            <h2>What will people be preoccupied with?</h2>
            <p>
              And take heed to yourselves, lest at any time your hearts be overcharged with <em>surfeiting, and drunkenness, and cares of this life</em>, and so that day come upon you unawares. <cite><b>Luke 21:34</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              But <em>as the days of Noe were, so shall also the coming of the Son of man be</em>. For as in the days that were before the flood they were eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, until the day that Noe entered into the ark, and knew not until the flood came, and took them all away; so shall also the coming of the Son of man be. <cite><b>Matthew 24:37-39</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> There’s nothing wrong with marriage as it was instituted and blessed by God, and it’s impossible to survive without nourishing our bodies. The point is in Noah’s days most people ignored him. Life is busy, and it’s easy to get preoccupied with temporal things and neglect spiritual things. Where do our own priorities stand?

              Go to now, ye rich men, weep and howl for your miseries that shall come upon you. <em>Your riches are corrupted</em>, and your garments are motheaten. Your gold and silver is cankered; and the rust of them shall be a witness against you, and shall eat your flesh as it were fire. Ye have heaped treasure together for the last days. Behold, the <em>hire of the labourers who have reaped down your fields, which is of you kept back by fraud, crieth</em>: and the cries of them which have reaped are entered into the ears of the Lord of sabaoth. Ye have lived in pleasure on the earth, and been wanton; ye have nourished your hearts, as in a day of slaughter. <cite><b>James 5:1-5</b></cite>

            <p>
              <em>Watch therefore</em>: for ye know not what hour your Lord doth come. But know this, that if the goodman of the house had known in what watch the thief would come, he would have watched, and would not have suffered his house to be broken up. Therefore <em>be ye also ready</em>: for in such an hour as ye think not the Son of man cometh. <cite><b>Matthew 24:42-44</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              Watch ye therefore, and <em>pray always</em>, that ye may be accounted worthy to escape all these things that shall come to pass, and to stand before the Son of man. <cite><b>Luke 21:36</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              I will say of the LORD, <em>He is my refuge and my fortress: my God; in him will I trust</em>. Surely <em>he shall deliver thee</em> from the snare of the fowler, and from the noisome pestilence. He shall cover thee with his feathers, and under his wings shalt thou trust: <em>his truth shall be thy shield and buckler</em>. <cite><b>Psalm 91:2-4</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> Those who watch for signs of Christ’s coming and pray that He will help them to be ready to meet Him won’t be disappointed. His truth will protect them from deception, and God will be with them every step of the way, no matter what happens.

            <h2>Has the judgment already begun?</h2>
            <p>
              And I saw another angel fly in the midst of heaven, having the everlasting gospel to preach unto them that dwell on the earth, and to every nation, and kindred, and tongue, and people, saying with a loud voice, Fear God, and give glory to him; <em>for the hour of his judgment is come</em>: and worship him that made heaven, and earth, and the sea, and the fountains of waters. <cite><b>Revelation 14:6,7</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              And, behold, I come quickly; and my reward is with me, <em>to give every man according as his work shall be</em>. <cite><b>Revelation 22:12</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> In Revelation 14 there are three angels proclaiming a message to the people of the world in the last days, and the first angel’s message is that the judgment has begun. So the judgment begins in the last days, which we are living in. When Jesus comes back to Earth He’s bringing a reward with Him, which means the judgment has already taken place to decide who will be saved.

            </p>

            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> Every person who has ever lived on planet Earth will be judged. Furthermore, each person will be responsible for his or her own actions; it will not be possible to hide behind another person’s decisions, actions, or ultimatums.

            <p>
              I beheld till the thrones were cast down, and <em>the Ancient of Days did sit</em>, whose garment was white as snow, and the hair of his head like the pure wool: his throne was like the fiery flame, and his wheels as burning fire. A fiery stream issued and came forth from before him: thousand thousands ministered unto him, and ten thousand times ten thousand stood before him: the <em>judgment was set, and the books were opened</em>. <cite><b>Daniel 7:9, 10</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              For the Father judgeth no man, but hath <em>committed all judgment unto the Son</em>. <cite><b>John 5:22</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              My little children, these things write I unto you, that ye sin not. And if any man sin, <em>we have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous</em>. <cite><b>1 John 2:1</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              And the great dragon was cast out, that old serpent, called <em>the Devil, and Satan</em>, which deceiveth the whole world: he was cast out into the earth ... for <em>the accuser of our brethren</em> is cast down, which accused them before our God day and night. <cite><b>Revelation 12:9, 10</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> God the Father, the Ancient of Days, presides over the judgment, while Jesus is the Judge, as well as our Advocate! Satan is our only accusser, declaring that we don’t deserve to be saved any more than he does.

            <p>
              Let us hear the conclusion of the whole matter: Fear God, and keep his commandments: for this is the whole duty of man. For <em>God shall bring every work into judgment, with every secret thing</em>, whether it be good, or whether it be evil. <cite><b>Ecclesiastes 12:13, 14</b></cite>
            </p>

              But I say unto you, That <em>every idle word that men shall speak, they shall give account thereof</em> in the day of judgment. <cite><b>Matthew 12:36</b></cite>

            <p>
              Neither is there any creature that is not manifest in his sight: but <em>all things are naked and opened unto the eyes of him with whom we have to do</em>. <cite><b>Hebrews 4:13</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              Therefore judge nothing before the time, until the Lord come, who both will <em>bring to light the hidden things of darkness, and will make manifest the counsels of the hearts</em>: and then shall every man have praise of God. <cite><b>1 Corinthians 4:5</b></cite>

            <h2>Does God keep a record of evidence for the judgment?</h2>
            <p>
              And I saw the dead, small and great, stand before God; and the books were opened: and another book was opened, which is the book of life: and <em>the dead were judged out of those things which were written in the books, according to their works</em>. <cite><b>Revelation 20:12</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              And there shall in no wise enter into it any thing that defileth, neither whatsoever worketh abomination, or maketh a lie: <em>but they which are written in the Lamb's book of life</em>. <cite><b>Revelation 21:27</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              For though thou wash thee with nitre, and take thee much soap, yet <em>thine iniquity is marked before me</em>, saith the Lord GOD. <cite><b>Jeremiah 2:22</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              Then those who feared the Lord spoke to one another, and the Lord listened attentively and heard it, and a <em>book of remembrance was written before Him for those who fear the Lord and esteem His name</em>. <cite><b>Malachi 3:16, NASB</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> Evidence for the judgment comes from books containing every detail of a person’s life, including every sin. There is also a Book of Remembrance containing every kind word, unselfish act, or sacrifice made by those who follow Jesus as evidence of God’s transforming power in their lives. These people’s names are also written in the Book of Life.

            <h2>What is God’s standard in the judgment?</h2>
            <p>
              If ye fulfil the royal law according to the scripture, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself, ye do well: But if ye have respect to persons, ye commit sin, and are <em>convinced of the law as transgressors</em>. For whosoever shall keep the whole law, and yet offend in one point, he is guilty of all. For he that said, Do not commit adultery, said also, Do not kill. Now if thou commit no adultery, yet if thou kill, thou art become a transgressor of the law. So speak ye, and so do, as they that <em>shall be judged by the law of liberty</em>. <cite><b>James 2:10-12</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              Whosoever committeth sin transgresseth also the law: for <em>sin is the transgression of the law</em>. <cite><b>1 John 3:4</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> If God keeps a record of our sins, and sin is the transgression of the law, then the Ten Commandment law is God’s standard by which we will be judged.

            </p>
            <p>
              Wherefore, as by one man sin entered into the world, and death by sin; and so <em>death passed upon all men</em>, for that all have sinned. <cite><b>Romans 5:12</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> Because all have sinned, everyone is under condemnation before the law. If nothing is done to remedy the situation, by default, every person sits on "death row" and simply waits for the judgment.

            <p>
              Seek ye the LORD while he may be found, call ye upon him while he is near: <em>Let the wicked forsake his way, and the unrighteous man his thoughts</em>: and let him return unto the LORD, and he will have mercy upon him; and to our God, for <em>he will abundantly pardon</em>. <cite><b>Isaiah 55:6-7</b></cite>

            <p class="note">

              But this man, because he continueth ever, hath an unchangeable priesthood. Wherefore he is able also to save them to the uttermost that come unto God by him, seeing <em>he ever liveth to make intercession for them</em>. <cite><b>Hebrews 7:24, 25</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              For we have not an high priest which cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities; but was <em>in all points tempted like as we are, yet without sin</em>. Let us therefore come boldly unto the throne of grace, that we may obtain mercy, and find grace to help in time of need. <cite><b>Hebrews 4:15-16</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">

            <p>
              Nevertheless I tell you the truth; It is expedient for you that I go away: for if I go not away, the Comforter will not come unto you; but if I depart, I will send him unto you. And when he is come, <em>he will reprove the world of sin</em>, and of righteousness, and of judgment. <cite><b>John 16:7, 8</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              But the Comforter, which is the Holy Ghost, whom the Father will send in my name, he shall teach you all things, and <em>bring all things to your remembrance</em>, whatsoever I have said unto you. <cite><b>John 14:26</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> The Holy Spirit plays a crucial role as well by convicting us of sin and bringing to remembrance sins we have not confessed yet so there isn’t a single unconfessed sin left in our heavenly record for Satan to point to as a witness against us in the judgment.

            <p>
              There is therefore now <em>no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus</em>, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit. For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus hath made me free from the law of sin and death. For what the law could not do, in that it was weak through the flesh, God sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh, and for sin, condemned sin in the flesh: <em>that the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit</em>. <cite><b>Romans 8:1-4</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              He that overcometh, the same shall be <em>clothed in white raiment</em>; and I will <em>not blot out his name out of the book of life</em>, but I will confess his name before my Father, and before his angels. <cite><b>Revelation 3:5</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              Notwithstanding in this rejoice not, that the spirits are subject unto you; but rather <em>rejoice, because your names are written in heaven</em>. <cite><b>Luke 10:20</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> Those whose record of sin has been blotted out are no longer under condemnation because they have been forgiven through Christ, who paid the penalty for their sin on the cross and who stands before the law on their behalf with His perfect character. The law can now be fulfilled in them through the abiding presence and enabling power of the Spirit, and their names will not be blotted out from the Book of Life!

            </p>
            <p>

            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> When the Holy Spirit convicts it is not wise to ignore it or put it off to a more convenient time because that time may never come. Tomorrow is not guaranteed; we only have today. Today is the day to get right with God.

              The law of the LORD is <em>perfect</em>, converting the soul: the testimony of the LORD is <em>sure</em>, making wise the simple. The statutes of the LORD are <em>right</em>, rejoicing the heart: the commandment of the LORD is <em>pure</em>, enlightening the eyes. <cite><b>Psalm 19:7, 8</b></cite>

              <b>Note:</b> Every government has laws to ensure order and protection for its citizens. It is no different with the King of the universe and His government, except His law is eternal, true, upright, perfect, sure, right, and pure. God’s dominion knows no bounds, and His law, therefore, is universal as well, so even though it’s mostly neglected on Earth, it is still binding.

            <h2>Does it have a role to play in my life?</h2>
            <p>
              The fear of the LORD is clean, enduring for ever: the judgments of the LORD are true and righteous altogether. More to be desired are they than gold, yea, than much fine gold: sweeter also than honey and the honeycomb. Moreover <em>by them is thy servant warned: and in keeping of them there is great reward</em>. <cite><b>Psalm 19:9-11</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              And the LORD commanded us to do all these statutes, to fear the LORD our God, <em>for our good always, that he might preserve us alive</em>, as it is at this day. <cite><b>Deuteronomy 6:24</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              My son, forget not my law; but let thine heart keep my commandments: <em>for length of days, and long life, and peace, shall they add to thee</em>. <cite><b>Proverbs 3:1, 2</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              Let us hear the conclusion of the whole matter: <em>fear God, and keep his commandments: for this is the whole duty of man</em>. <cite><b>Ecclesiastes 12:13</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> Satan rebelled against God’s law in heaven because he didn’t want to be restricted by it, and when Adam and Even believed his lie about defining good and evil for themselves (Genesis 3:5), his lawless kingdom took over Earth as well. Our Creator God defines good and evil for us in His law because He knows what’s best for us better than we will ever know ourselves. And His law is not a restriction; it’s there to be a blessing, to protect us from evils, such as murder, adultery, theft, and falsehood, ensuring a happy and harmonious existence for all.

            <p>
              If ye fulfil the royal law according to the scripture, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself, ye do well: But if ye have respect to persons, ye commit sin, and are convinced of the law as transgressors. <em>For whosoever shall keep the whole law, and yet offend in one point, he is guilty of all</em>. For he that said, Do not commit adultery, said also, Do not kill. Now if thou commit no adultery, yet if thou kill, <em>thou art become a transgressor of the law</em>. So speak ye, and so do, as they that shall be judged by the law of liberty. <cite><b>James 2:8-12</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              For as many as are of the works of the law are under the curse: for it is written, <em>Cursed is every one that continueth not in all things which are written in the book of the law to do them</em>. <cite><b>Galatians 3:10</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              But we are all as an unclean thing, and <em>all our righteousnesses are as filthy rags</em>; and we all do fade as a leaf; and our iniquities, like the wind, have taken us away. <cite><b>Isaiah 64:6</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> When James is talking about the law, he is referring to the Ten Commandments, and he actually says it’s not enough to keep some or even most of them. Breaking even one is breaking them all. Consequently, there is no human being who hasn’t been condemned by the law, which is the standard during the judgment (see “Judgment”).

            <h2>Does God leave me in my condemned state?</h2>
            <p>
              But that no man is justified by the law in the sight of God, it is evident: for, <em>The just shall live by faith</em>.  <cite><b>Galatians 3:11</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              For sin shall not have dominion over you: for <em>ye are not under the law, but under grace</em>. <cite><b>Romans 6:14</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              Being justified freely by his grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus: whom God hath set forth to be a propitiation through faith in his blood, to declare his righteousness for the remission of sins that are past, through the forbearance of God; to declare, I say, at this time his righteousness: that he might be just, and the justifier of him which believeth in Jesus. Where is boasting then? It is excluded. By what law? of works? Nay: but by the law of faith. Therefore we conclude that a <em>man is justified by faith without the deeds of the law</em>. <cite><b>Romans 3:24-28</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> Because Jesus is the Creator God, He was able to take the condemnation of the law on Himself at the cross, on behalf of all humanity, so that every person who accepts Him by faith in His substitutionary sacrifice could stand before the law clothed in His perfectly righteous life!

            <h2>Does that mean we are now free to break it?</h2>
            <p>
              Therefore we conclude that a man is justified by faith without the deeds of the law. Is he the God of the Jews only? Is he not also of the Gentiles? Yes, of the Gentiles also: seeing it is one God, which shall justify the circumcision by faith, and uncircumcision through faith. <em>Do we then make void the law through faith? God forbid: yea, we establish the law</em>. <cite><b>Romans 3:28-31</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              What then? shall we sin, because we are not under the law, but under grace? <em>God forbid</em>. <cite><b>Romans 6:15</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              Think not that I am come to destroy the law, or the prophets: <em>I am not come to destroy, but to fulfil</em>. For verily I say unto you, Till heaven and earth pass, one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law, till all be fulfilled. <cite><b>Matthew 5:17, 18</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> If you were caught speeding and the police officer wanted to give you a hefty fine, but decided to give you a warning instead, would you then go screeching out back on the highway to break the speed limit again? No, you would carefully watch your speed. Jesus’ death on the cross was an act of mercy and forgiveness for those who accept it, not a license to live lawlessly.

            <p>

            <h2>What does sin do?</h2>
            <p>
              Behold, the LORD'S hand is not shortened, that it cannot save; neither his ear heavy, that it cannot hear: But <em>your iniquities have separated between you and your God</em>, and your sins have hid his face from you, that he will not hear. <cite><b>Isaiah 59:1, 2</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              <em>For the wages of sin is death</em>; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord. <cite><b>Romans 6:23</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> Sin cannot exist in the presence of a holy God because at the root of sin is selfishness, which is abhorent to God’s character of love. As a result, sin creates separation between me and God, the Giver of life, and leads to eternal death if left untreated.

            <h2>What is the motivation for keeping His law?</h2>
            <p>
              <em>If ye love me</em>, keep my commandments. <cite><b>John 14:15</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              For <em>this is the love of God, that we keep his commandments</em>: and his commandments are not grievous. <cite><b>1 John 5:3</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              Then one of them, which was a lawyer, asked him a question, tempting him, and saying, Master, which is the great commandment in the law? Jesus said unto him, <em>Thou shalt love the Lord thy God</em> with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind. This is the first and great commandment. And the second is like unto it, <em>Thou shalt love thy neighbour</em> as thyself. <em>On these two commandments hang all the law</em> and the prophets. <cite><b>Matthew 22:35-40</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              Love worketh no ill to his neighbour: therefore <em>love is the fulfilling of the law</em>. <cite><b>Romans 13:10</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> Since selfishness is at the root of sin, and sin is the breaking of His law, then the law is really a law of love, dealing with my relationship with God (the first four commandments) and my neighbor (the last six). That’s why Jesus said that the entire law hangs on loving God and loving my neighbor. When there is genuine love present in a relationship then pleasing that person ceases to become a burden; in fact, without love for Jesus it’s not possible to keep His law.

            <h2>What is one of the purposes of the law?</h2>
            <p>
              He who says, “I know Him,” and does not keep His commandments, is a liar, and the truth is not in him. But whoever keeps His word, truly the love of God is perfected in him. <em>By this we know that we are in Him</em>. <cite><b>1 John 2:4, 5, NKJV</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              Not every one that saith unto me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of heaven; but <em>he that doeth the will of my Father which is in heaven</em>. Many will say to me in that day, Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied in thy name? and in thy name have cast out devils? and in thy name done many wonderful works? And then will I profess unto them, <em>I never knew you: depart from me, ye that work iniquity</em>. <cite><b>Matthew 7:21-23</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              The <em>heart is deceitful above all things</em>, and desperately wicked: who can know it? <em>I the LORD search the heart</em>, I try the reins, even to give every man according to his ways, and according to the fruit of his doings. <cite><b>Jeremiah 17:9, 10</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              O LORD, <em>thou hast searched me, and known me</em>. Thou knowest my downsitting and mine uprising, thou understandest my thought afar off. Thou compassest my path and my lying down, and <em>art acquainted with all my ways</em>. For there is not a word in my tongue, but, lo, O LORD, thou knowest it altogether. <cite><b>Psalm 139:1-4</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> God knows me better than I know myself, and He knows if I truly love Him. The Ten Commandments are really a mirror for me that shows my genuine condition; they provide evidence letting me know if I truly love Him because it can be easy to deceive myself. Jesus says there will be people who served Him and thought they loved Him, but their lawlessness will say otherwise.

            <p>
              For this is the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel after those days, saith the Lord; <em>I will put my laws into their mind, and write them in their hearts</em>: and I will be to them a God, and they shall be to me a people. <cite><b>Hebrews 8:10</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              Then will I sprinkle clean water upon you, and ye shall be clean: from all your filthiness, and from all your idols, will I cleanse you. A new heart also will I give you, and a new spirit will I put within you: and I will take away the stony heart out of your flesh, and I will give you an heart of flesh. <em>And I will put my spirit within you, and cause you to walk in my statutes, and ye shall keep my judgments, and do them</em>. <cite><b>Ezekiel 36:25-27</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              Hitherto have ye asked nothing in my name: <em>ask, and ye shall receive, that your joy may be full</em>. <cite><b>John 16:34</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              I delight to do thy will, O my God: yea, <em>thy law is within my heart</em>. <cite><b>Psalm 40:8</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> God promises to help me keep His commandments because He knows that I cannot overcome sin myself. But He does not force Himself on anyone, so I must ask, and the promise is He will write His law in my heart and mind, enabling me to walk in His commandments through the power of the Holy Spirit dwelling in me! If I believe that He will keep this promise, He will do it according to my faith, and He will make it a delight to do His will because He will write the law in my heart! The only one who can create a new heart in me is the One who created the world in Eden.

            <h2>How does the devil feel about keeping God’s law?</h2>
            <p>
              And <em>the dragon was wroth with the woman</em>, and went to make war with the remnant of her seed, <em>which keep the commandments of God</em>, and have the testimony of Jesus Christ. <cite><b>Revelation 12:17</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              Jesus replied, “And <em>why do you break the command of God for the sake of your tradition</em>? ... Thus you nullify the word of God for the sake of your tradition. You hypocrites! Isaiah prophesied correctly about you: ‘These people honor Me with their lips, but their hearts are far from Me. <em>They worship Me in vain; they teach as doctrine the precepts of men</em>.’ <cite><b>Matthew 15:3, 6-9</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              It is time for thee, LORD, to work: <em>for they have made void thy law</em>. <cite><b>Psalm 119:126</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> The devil’s war against God and His law started in the courts of heaven and has been raging ever since here on Earth. Is it any surprise that the devil would try to persuade people that God's law is no longer binding and even go as far as persecuting those who keep it?

            <p>
              And I saw another angel fly in the midst of heaven, having the everlasting gospel to preach unto them that dwell on the earth, and to every nation, and kindred, and tongue, and people, saying with a loud voice, Fear God, and give glory to him; for the hour of his judgment is come: and <em>worship him that made heaven, and earth, and the sea, and the fountains of waters</em>. <cite><b>Revelation 14:6, 7</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> In Revelation 14 there are three angels proclaiming a message to the people of the world in the last days, and the first angel’s message is a call to worship the Creator God and give glory to Him.

            </p>
            <p>
              For by him [Jesus] were all things created, that are in heaven, and that are in earth, visible and invisible, whether they be thrones, or dominions, or principalities, or powers: <em>all things were created by him, and for him</em>: and he is before all things, and <em>by him all things consist</em>. <cite><b>Colossians 1:16, 17</b></cite>

            <h2>Which commandment identifies the Creator God?</h2>
            <p>
              Remember the sabbath day, to keep it holy. Six days shalt thou labour, and do all thy work: but the seventh day is the sabbath of the LORD thy God: in it thou shalt not do any work, thou, nor thy son, nor thy daughter, thy manservant, nor thy maidservant, nor thy cattle, nor thy stranger that is within thy gates: <em>for in six days the LORD made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that in them is, and rested the seventh day</em>: wherefore the LORD blessed the sabbath day, and hallowed it. <cite><b>Exodus 20:8-11</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> The fourth commandment begins with the word “remember” because God knew His Sabbath would be forgotten. It also identifies God as the Creator of everything, and every created being is invited to show his or her acknowledgment of this by resting on the Sabbath day, just like He rested on the seventh day as an example for us.

            <h2>What else can I learn about the Sabbath from Genesis 2?</h2>
            <p>
              Thus the heavens and the earth were finished, and all the host of them. And on the seventh day God ended his work which he had made; and he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had made. And <em>God blessed the seventh day, and sanctified it</em>: because that in it he had rested from all his work which God created and made. <cite><b>Genesis 2:1-3</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> The reason why the fourth commandment invites me to keep the Sabbath day holy is because God blessed this specific day and sanctified it. The word used in the original text is “qadash,” which means “to be set apart or consecrated.” In other words, the seventh day is special to God and unlike any of the other six days of the week.

            <h2>Who is the Sabbath really for?</h2>
            <p>
              And he said unto them, <em>The sabbath was made for man</em>, and not man for the sabbath: therefore the Son of man is Lord also of the sabbath. <cite><b>Mark 2:27, 28</b></cite>

            <h2>Why was it given to us?</h2>
            <p>
              Moreover also I gave them my sabbaths, <em>to be a sign</em> between me and them, that they <em>might know that I am the LORD that sanctify them</em>. ... And hallow my sabbaths; and they shall be a sign between me and you, <em>that ye may know that I am the LORD your God</em>. <cite><b>Ezekiel 20:12, 20</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> The Sabbath is a sign of my acknowledgment that 1) God is Lord of the universe because He created it in six literal days (Exodus 20:8, 11) and 2) He is Lord of my life because He’s the One who redeems and sanctifies me. In Eden God rested on the seventh day from His word of creation, and in the tomb Jesus rested on the same day from His work of redemption. Thus the Sabbath is a memorial of these two things, a weekly rest in Jesus where despite having a plethora of things to do, I still put them aside to connect with and honor Him. The Sabbath is also a beautiful weekly reminder that I am saved by faith in His completed work on the cross, instead of my own works.

              And that day was the preparation, and <em>the sabbath drew on</em>. And the women also, which came with him from Galilee, followed after, and beheld the sepulchre, and how his body was laid. And they returned, and prepared spices and ointments; and <em>rested the sabbath day according to the commandment</em>. <cite><b>Luke 23:54-56</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              Now <em>upon the first day of the week</em>, very early in the morning, <em>they came unto the sepulchre</em>, bringing the spices which they had prepared, and certain others with them. <cite><b>Luke 24:1</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> The Bible is clear that His followers kept the Sabbath. In fact, they even stopped their work of anointing His body in order to keep it according to the commandment. They ended up coming back on Sunday, the first day of the week, after the Sabbath was over, to finish their work.

              And when the Jews were gone out of the synagogue, the <em>Gentiles besought that these words might be preached to them the next sabbath</em>.

            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> God is Lord of the Sabbath, which is Saturday, the seventh day (Exodus 8:11). Notice that He calls these days “My Sabbaths,” meaning it’s His special day that He blessed and sanctified to be a sign between Him and me of His creative, redeeming, and sanctifying power! The Sabbath is a day of rest from works, and as such, it is a beautiful symbol of righteousness by faith as we are saved by the righteousness of Jesus, not our works.

            <h2>Is the Sabbath temporary or perpetual?</h2>
            <p>
              Wherefore the children of Israel shall keep the sabbath, to observe the sabbath throughout their generations, for a <em>perpetual covenant</em>. It is a sign between me and the children of Israel <em>for ever</em>: for in six days the LORD made heaven and earth, and on the seventh day he rested, and was refreshed. And he gave unto Moses, when he had made an end of communing with him upon mount Sinai, two tables of testimony, <em>tables of stone</em>, written with the finger of God. <cite><b>Exodus 31:16-18</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> The Ten Commandments, which the Sabbath is a part of, were written by the finger of God on tablets of stone, instead of a material subject to decay, like wood or clay, as a testament to their timelessness. This is in contrast to Jesus writing the sins of the woman caught in adultery in the dust (John 8:1-11), as a beautiful testament to God’s willingness to forgive anyone who repents.

            <h2>Wasn’t the Sabbath for the Jewish people only?</h2>
            <p>
              Thus the heavens and the earth were finished, and all the host of them. And on the seventh day God ended his work which he had made; and <em>he rested on the seventh day</em> from all his work which he had made. And <em>God blessed the seventh day, and sanctified it</em>: because that in it he had rested from all his work which God created and made. <cite><b>Genesis 2:1-3</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              For as the new heavens and the new earth, which I will make, shall remain before me, saith the LORD, so shall your seed and your name remain. And it shall come to pass, that from one new moon to another, and <em>from one sabbath to another, shall all flesh come to worship before me</em>, saith the LORD. <cite><b>Isaiah 66:22, 23</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> The seventh day Sabbath, known as Saturday today, was set apart, blessed, and sanctified on the very first week of creation, long before there was a Jewish nation, and it will be kept even in heaven.

            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> Because all have sinned, everyone is in need of the sanctifying power of Christ, which the Sabbath is a sign of, so naturally, the Sabbath is a perpetual sign for everyone.

            <h2>What does the Bible say about unbelief and the seventh day?</h2>
            <p>
              For he spake in a certain place of the seventh day on this wise, and God did rest the seventh day from all his works. And in this place again, If they shall enter into my rest. Seeing therefore it remaineth that some must enter therein, and <em>they to whom it was first preached entered not in because of unbelief</em> ... There remaineth therefore a rest to the people of God. For he that is entered into his rest, he also hath ceased from his own works, as God did from his. <em>Let us labour therefore to enter into that rest, lest any man fall after the same example of unbelief</em>. <cite><b>Hebrews 4:4-6, 9-11</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> The book of Hebrews says there was unbelief about resting on the seventh day, but to deny this day is to deny salvation by faith. Because I cannot sanctify or save myself, I am invited to cease from trying to be saved by my own works and rest in the righteous life of Jesus on my behalf. Resting on the seventh day of the week, as God did in Genesis 2, is an acknowledgment of this sublime truth.

              And that day was the preparation, and the sabbath drew on. And the women also, which came with him from Galilee, followed after, and beheld the sepulchre, and how his body was laid. And they returned, and prepared spices and ointments; and <em>rested the sabbath day according to the commandment</em>. <cite><b>Luke 23:54-56</b></cite>

            </p>
            <p>
              In the end of the sabbath, as it began to dawn toward the <em>first day of the week, came Mary Magdalene and the other Mary to see the sepulchre</em>. <cite><b>Matthew 28:1</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              And very early in the morning the <em>first day of the week, they came unto the sepulchre</em> at the rising of the sun. <cite><b>Mark 16:2</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              The <em>first day of the week cometh Mary Magdalene early, when it was yet dark, unto the sepulchre</em>, and seeth the stone taken away from the sepulchre. <cite><b>John 20:1</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              Now when Jesus was risen early the <em>first day of the week, he appeared first to Mary Magdalene</em>, out of whom he had cast seven devils. <cite><b>Mark 16:9</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> Jesus’ followers were so concerned about the Sabbath that they even stopped their labor of love in preparing His body for burial, kept the Sabbath, and returned to resume their unfinished work early Sunday morning. Notice there is no mention of them keeping the first day, Sunday, holy in honor of Jesus’ resurrection, nor is there a command by Jesus to do so. When He appeared to Mary Magdalene that morning there was no talk of Sunday keeping at all.

            <p>
              Know ye not, that so many of us as were baptized into Jesus Christ were baptized into his death? Therefore <em>we are buried with him by baptism into death: that like as Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the Father, even so we also should walk in newness of life</em>. For if we have been planted together in the likeness of his death, we shall be also in the likeness of his resurrection: knowing this, <em>that our old man is crucified with him, that the body of sin might be destroyed, that henceforth we should not serve sin</em>. <cite><b>Romans 6:3-5</b></cite>

              <b>Note:</b> Jesus instituted baptism in honor of His resurrection, which serves as a symbol of death to sin and the start of a new life in and for Christ.

            <p>
              And upon the <em>first day of the week, when the disciples came together to break bread</em>, Paul preached unto them, ready to depart on the morrow; and continued his speech until midnight. <cite><b>Acts 20:7</b></cite>

            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> There is no significance to the breaking of bread in Acts 20:7 because in Acts 2:46 we learn that the early Christians broke break daily. Nothing in these passages indicates that they considered the first day holy. The meeting in Acts 20:7 was taking place because Paul was leaving the next day.

On the contrary, His mission was to fulfill the law, to uphold and expand it beyond the “letter” of the law to include the “spirit” of the law, as well. (For example, He expanded the sin of adultery to also include lust of the heart, see Matthew 5:28.)

              And he shall <em>speak great words against the most High</em>, and shall <em>wear out the saints</em> of the most High, and <em>think to change times and laws</em>: and they shall be given into his hand until a time and times and the dividing of time. <cite><b>Daniel 7:25</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> This is an echo of Paul’s warning about men arising “speaking perverse things.” Again, here’s a power that would challenge God’s authority, persecute His followers, and change times and laws. There is only one commandment that is both a time and a law: the fourth one. The first seeds for its change were planted during Constantine’s conversion to Christianity in 312 A.D. when he passed a law declaring Sunday, which was the pagan day of the sun, as the day of rest across the Roman Empire. That seed took root in 363 A.D. when the Council of Laodicea urged Christians to keep Sunday as their rest day, while prohibiting them from resting on Saturday, the seventh day Sabbath, and the rest is history.

            <h2>Did Jesus warn about this?</h2>
            <p>
              Thus have <em>ye made the commandment of God of none effect by your tradition</em>. Ye hypocrites, well did Esaias prophesy of you, saying, This people draweth nigh unto me with their mouth, and honoureth me with their lips; but their heart is far from me. But in vain they do worship me, <em>teaching for doctrines the commandments of men</em>. <cite><b>Matthew 15:6-9</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> The elevation of human-made commandments and tradition above the truth of the Bible was already a problem in Jesus’ time, and He warned against such hypocrisy.

            <h2>What role will the law play in the last days?</h2>
            <p>
              And after these things I saw four angels standing on the four corners of the earth, holding the four winds of the earth, that the wind should not blow on the earth, nor on the sea, nor on any tree. And I saw another angel ascending from the east, having the seal of the living God: and he cried with a loud voice to the four angels, to whom it was given to hurt the earth and the sea, saying, Hurt not the earth, neither the sea, nor the trees, <em>till we have sealed the servants of our God in their foreheads</em>. <cite><b>Revelation 7:1-3</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              Bind up the testimony, <em>seal the law</em> among my disciples. <cite><b>Isaiah 8:16</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> In the last days there will be a sealing of God’s people in their foreheads, and Isaiah says it’s the law that’s sealed among His people. The sealing of the law in the forehead is God’s people making an unwavering decision in their mind to honor the authority of God’s law in their life as supreme and above the laws of men, no matter the cost.

            <h2>What is said about the saints?</h2>
            <p>
              Saying with a loud voice, Fear God, and give glory to him; for the hour of his judgment is come: and <em>worship him that made heaven, and earth, and the sea, and the fountains of waters</em>. ... Here is the patience of the saints: here are <em>they that keep the commandments of God, and the faith of Jesus</em>. <cite><b>Revelation 14:7, 12</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> There will be a call in the last days to worship God, the Creator of the universe, which implies there will be another power vying to be worshiped as well. This call is a reference to the last part of the fourth commandment where keeping the Sabbath is identified as a sign and an acknowledgment that God is the Creator of all. Could the worship of God by keeping Saturday, the seventh day Sabbath, constitute the seal of God in the last days? Verse 12 leaves no room for doubt when it says the saints will be keeping the faith of Jesus, who kept the seventh day Sabbath, and the commandments of God, which include the fourth. May we be found faithful in our stand for Jesus.

            <h2>What does Isaiah say about those who keep the Sabbath?</h2>
            <p>
              <em>Blessed is the man</em> that doeth this, and the son of man that layeth hold on it; that keepeth the sabbath from polluting it, and keepeth his hand from doing any evil. <cite><b>Isaiah 56:2</b></cite>

            <h2>Is this confirmed elsewhere?</h2>
            <p>
              For in six days the LORD made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that in them is, and rested the seventh day: wherefore <em>the LORD blessed the sabbath day</em>, and hallowed it. <cite><b>Exodus 20:11</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              And it shall come to pass, if thou shalt hearken diligently unto the voice of the LORD thy God, to observe and to do all his commandments which I command thee this day, that the LORD thy God will set thee on high above all nations of the earth: and <em>all these blessings shall come on thee, and overtake thee</em>, if thou shalt hearken unto the voice of the LORD thy God. ... But it shall come to pass, if thou wilt not hearken unto the voice of the LORD thy God, to observe to do all his commandments and his statutes which I command thee this day; that all these curses shall come upon thee, and overtake thee. <cite><b>Deuteronomy 28:1, 2, 15</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> The Sabbath was not made to be a burden, but a blessing to the human race, and those who keep it partake in the blessing on a weekly basis. In Deuteronomy 28 God also pronounces other blessings on those who keep His commandments, including the fourth.

            <h2>How is the Sabbath to be kept?</h2>
            <p>
              Remember the sabbath day, to keep it holy. Six days shalt thou labour, and do all thy work: but the seventh day is the sabbath of the LORD thy God: in it <em>thou shalt not do any work, thou, nor thy son, nor thy daughter, thy manservant, nor thy maidservant, nor thy cattle, nor thy stranger that is within thy gates</em>: for in six days the LORD made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that in them is, and rested the seventh day: wherefore the LORD blessed the sabbath day, and hallowed it. <cite><b>Exodus 20:8-11</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> The Sabbath was instituted to provide rest and refuge in and through Christ. It’s a special weekly blessing to everyone who chooses to rest from their works by trusting in Him. We may have a long list of things to do, but we can still put them aside in order to have time to connect with God and acknowledge His supremacy in our lives. This rest from work extends to everyone “within our gates” or under our authority.

            </p>
            <p>

            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> Looking to Jesus as our example in all things, we learn that Sabbath keeping is also about gathering together with other believers for worship, spiritual nourishment, and fellowship.

            <h2>When does the Sabbath start and end?</h2>
            <p>
              It is to be a Sabbath of complete rest for you, and you shall humble yourselves; on the ninth of the month at evening, <em>from evening until evening</em>, you shall keep your Sabbath. <cite><b>Leviticus 23:32, NASB</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              And God called the light Day, and the darkness he called Night. And <em>the evening and the morning were the first day</em>. <cite><b>Genesis 1:5</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> In the Bible, the day does not actually start and end at midnight; it starts from sunset and lasts until the next day’s sunset. In the Genesis account each day includes the prior evening as well, so since the Sabbath is the seventh day of the week, it would start from sunset on Friday and last until sunset on Saturday.

            <h2>What insight does Isaiah give?</h2>
            <p>
              If thou turn away thy foot from the sabbath, from doing thy pleasure on my holy day; and <em>call the sabbath a delight</em>, the holy of the LORD, honourable; and <em>shalt honour him, not doing thine own ways, nor finding thine own pleasure, nor speaking thine own words</em>: then shalt thou <em>delight thyself in the LORD</em>; and I will cause thee to ride upon the high places of the earth, and feed thee with the heritage of Jacob thy father: for the mouth of the LORD hath spoken it. <cite><b>Isaiah 58:13, 14</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> The Sabbath becomes a delight when it is centered around Jesus&mdash;when we put away our own pursuits and rest from the cares of life in order to focus on the eternal things of God. It’s a special day to reflect on, honor, and connect with Him. Simply put, it’s a day to delight in Him.

            <h2>What can we learn from the experience of Nehemiah?</h2>
            <p>
              In those days <em>saw I in Judah some treading wine presses on the sabbath, and bringing in sheaves, and lading asses; as also wine, grapes, and figs, and all manner of burdens, which they brought into Jerusalem on the sabbath day</em>: and I testified against them in the day wherein they sold victuals. There dwelt men of Tyre also therein, which brought fish, and all manner of ware, and <em>sold on the sabbath</em> unto the children of Judah, and in Jerusalem. Then I contended with the nobles of Judah, and said unto them, What evil thing is this that ye do, and profane the sabbath day? Did not your fathers thus, and did not our God bring all this evil upon us, and upon this city? yet ye bring more wrath upon Israel by profaning the sabbath.
              <br><br>
              And it came to pass, that when the gates of Jerusalem began to be dark before the sabbath, I commanded that the gates should be shut, and charged that they should not be opened till after the sabbath: and some of my servants set I at the gates, that there should no burden be brought in on the sabbath day. So the merchants and sellers of all kind of ware lodged without Jerusalem once or twice. Then I testified against them, and said unto them, Why lodge ye about the wall? if ye do so again, I will lay hands on you. <em>From that time forth came they no more on the sabbath. And I commanded the Levites that they should cleanse themselves, and that they should come and keep the gates, to sanctify the sabbath day</em>.<cite><b>Nehemiah 13:15-22</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> We can clearly see that buying, selling, and conducting business to generate income are activities that profane the Sabbath day. Now this can pose a challenge for some professions; it wouldn’t be right to abandon people requiring medical care on the Sabbath, for example, but as far as it is possible, we should seek to rest from income-generating work in order to honor our Creator.

            <h2>What activities are encouraged on the Sabbath?</h2>
            <p>
              And he said unto them, What man shall there be among you, that shall have one sheep, and if it fall into a pit on the sabbath day, will he not lay hold on it, and lift it out? How much then is a man better than a sheep? Wherefore <em>it is lawful to do well on the sabbath days</em>. Then saith he to the man, Stretch forth thine hand. And he stretched it forth; and it was restored whole, like as the other. <cite><b>Matthew 12:11-13</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> Jesus continued to heal people on the Sabbath, contrary to the tradition of the religious leaders of that day. Ministering to the sick, the needy, and the discouraged by relieving their suffering, whether physical, emotional, or spiritual, is what makes the Sabbath a delight.

            <h2>For whom was the Sabbath instituted?</h2>
            <p>
              And it came to pass, that he went through the corn fields on the sabbath day; and his disciples began, as they went, to pluck the ears of corn. And the Pharisees said unto him, Behold, why do they on the sabbath day that which is not lawful? And he said unto them, Have ye never read what David did, when he had need, and was an hungred, he, and they that were with him? How he went into the house of God in the days of Abiathar the high priest, and did eat the shewbread, which is not lawful to eat but for the priests, and gave also to them which were with him? And he said unto them, <em>The sabbath was made for man, and not man for the sabbath</em>: therefore the Son of man is Lord also of the sabbath. <cite><b>Mark 2:23-28</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> The Pharisees had so many additional man-made rules to ensure the Sabbath was kept holy that they turned it into a burden, but Jesus did not follow these rules. He only followed God’s rules, which are there to ensure the Sabbath is a delight. In fact, He made it quite clear that the Sabbath was made for us, and not the other way around.

            <h2>Will God provide for my needs?</h2>
            <p>
              And the LORD said unto Moses, How long refuse ye to keep my commandments and my laws? See, for that the LORD hath given you the sabbath, therefore <em>he giveth you on the sixth day the bread of two days</em>; abide ye every man in his place, let no man go out of his place on the seventh day. So the people rested on the seventh day. <cite><b>Exodus 16:28-30</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              Wherefore the LORD God of Israel saith, I said indeed that thy house, and the house of thy father, should walk before me for ever: but now the LORD saith, Be it far from me; <em>for them that honour me I will honour</em>, and they that despise me shall be lightly esteemed. <cite><b>1 Samuel 2:30</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> It may be tempting to worry about lost income on the Sabbath, but just as God miraculously provided a double portion of bread for the Israelites on Friday to ensure they had enough for Saturday, He will also provide for our needs today when we choose to honor Him by resting on His holy day.

            <h2>What is faith?</h2>
            <p>
              Now faith is the <em>substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen</em>. <cite><b>Hebrews 11:1</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> Faith is what reaches out and grasps things not seen that are backed up by evidence. In Isaiah 1:18 God says, “Come now, and let us reason together,” which means He does not want anyone to blindly follow Him; on the contrary, He wants faith to be informed by evidence.
            </p>
          </section>
          <section>
            <div>2</div>
            <h2>Why is faith necessary?</h2>
            <p>
              But without faith it is impossible to please him: for <em>he that cometh to God must believe that he is</em>, and <em>that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him</em>. <cite><b>Hebrews 11:6</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> Faith is the means by which my journey with Jesus starts. It is the hand of faith that reaches out to grasp the outstretched hand of God. He is always ready and eager to help those who come to Him, but I must first believe in Him and His goodness. This faith is based on plentiful evidence, but the evidence does not remove the need for faith altogether. There will always be room for doubt for those who want to doubt simply because the finite human mind cannot fully grasp an everlasting, infinite God. Thus the need for faith: God said it&mdash;I believe it.

            <div>3</div>
            <h2>How many have faith?</h2>
            <p>
              For I say, through the grace given unto me, to every man that is among you, not to think of himself more highly than he ought to think; but to think soberly, according as <em>God hath dealt to every man the measure of faith</em>. <cite><b>Romans 12:3</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> Fatih is like a muscle; every person has been given a measure of it. Some neglect it, never use it, and it grows weak. Others act on what they have, reaching out to God, and He meets them where they are, revealing Himself to them, which in turn makes their faith stronger, and then they act on that, and it continues to grow each time it is used.

            <h2>What if my faith is weak?</h2>
            <p>
              And the apostles said unto the Lord, <em>Increase our faith</em>. <cite><b>Luke 17:5</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              Jesus said unto him, If thou canst believe, all things are possible to him that believeth. And straightway the father of the child cried out, and said with tears, <em>Lord, I believe; help thou mine unbelief</em>. <cite><b>Mark 9:23, 24</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              Then came the disciples to Jesus apart, and said, Why could not we cast him out? And Jesus said unto them, Because of your unbelief: for verily I say unto you, <em>If ye have faith as a grain of mustard seed</em>, ye shall say unto this mountain, Remove hence to yonder place; and it shall remove; and nothing shall be impossible unto you. <cite><b>Matthew 17:19, 20</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> Even if my faith is weak and small as a tiny seed, I can exercise the faith that I do have, and ask God to increase it, believing in His power to do so, and it will be done.

            <h2>What is faith based on?</h2>
            <p>
              So then faith cometh by hearing, and hearing <em>by the word of God</em>. <cite><b>Romans 10:17</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              Another parable put he forth unto them, saying, The kingdom of heaven is <em>like to a grain of mustard seed</eM>, which a man took, and sowed in his field: which indeed is the least of all seeds: but <em>when it is grown, it is the greatest among herbs, and becometh a tree</em>, so that the birds of the air come and lodge in the branches thereof. <cite><b>Matthew 13:31, 32</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> Faith is primarily based on the evidence of truth revealed in the Word of God, the Bible. Like a seed that is watered by the rain, faith grows whenever it is watered with the truth of His Word and that truth is then internalized&mdash;received and allowed to take root in the heart. With my cooperation, God can take the small seed of faith and make it grow into a tall tree.

            <h2>What role does faith have in prayer?</h2>
            <p>
              And Jesus answering saith unto them, Have faith in God. For verily I say unto you, That whosoever shall say unto this mountain, Be thou removed, and be thou cast into the sea; and shall not doubt in his heart, but shall believe that those things which he saith shall come to pass; he shall have whatsoever he saith. Therefore I say unto you, What things soever ye desire, <em>when ye pray, believe that ye receive them, and ye shall have them</em>. <cite><b>Mark 11:22-24</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              And when he was come into the house, the blind men came to him: and Jesus saith unto them, Believe ye that I am able to do this? They said unto him, Yea, Lord. Then touched he their eyes, saying, <em>According to your faith be it unto you</em>. And their eyes were opened. <cite><b>Matthew 9:28-30</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              And this is the confidence that we have in him, that, <em>if we ask any thing according to his will, he heareth us</em>. <cite><b>1 John 5:14</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              But <em>let him ask in faith, with no doubting</em>, for he who doubts is like a wave of the sea driven and tossed by the wind. <cite><b>James 1:6, NKJV</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> My prayers are answered according to my faith, or confidence, in Jesus’ power and love, which I become aware of by exposing my mind and heart to His Word. The Bible says that I can be confident that any request that is in harmony with God’s will, as revealed in His Word, He hears.

            <h2>What is the power of the gospel dependent on?</h2>
            <p>
              For unto us was the gospel preached, as well as unto them: but the word preached did not profit them, not <em>being mixed with faith in them that heard it</em>. <cite><b>Hebrews 4:2</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> The gospel is the good news of God’s desire and power to save humanity from the misery of sin. When the gospel is mingled with faith, it is acted on and received into the mind and heart, starting a marvelous process of transformation in the life of the receiver through the power of God.

              That ye be not slothful, but followers of them who <em>through faith and patience inherit the promises</em>. <cite><b>Hebrews 6:12</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              <em>These all died in faith, not having received the promises, but having seen them afar off, and were persuaded of them, and embraced them</em>, and confessed that they were strangers and pilgrims on the earth. For they that say such things declare plainly that they seek a country. And truly, if they had been mindful of that country from whence they came out, they might have had opportunity to have returned. But now they desire a better country, that is, an heavenly: wherefore God is not ashamed to be called their God: for he hath prepared for them a city. <cite><b>Hebrews 11:13-16</b></cite>

            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> The Bible shows God is willing to forgive anyone who is truly repentant. When this evidence is acted on by faith, when I take God at His Word, He will forgive me too, just like He forgave the paralytic according to his faith.

            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> Salvation is only through faith. I am made righteous by faith in Jesus’ love as expressed in His willingness to forgive my sins and clothe me with His righteousness. I am also sanctified by faith in His power to save me from my sins. Salvation is completely of God; it is a gift. Faith is the means by which I reach out to Him and recieve that gift.

            <h2>What is evident in those who are saved by faith?</h2>
            <p>
              By whom [Jesus] we have received grace and apostleship, <em>for obedience to the faith</em> among all nations, for his name. <cite><b>Romans 1:5</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              Here is the patience of the saints: here are they that <em>keep the commandments of God, and the faith of Jesus</em>. <cite><b>Revelation 14:12</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> Those who have the faith of Jesus also keep the commandments of God because Jesus Himself kept them. In the book of Romans Paul says Jesus gives us grace for obedience to the faith. Now it is true that I am saved by faith alone, but it is also true that once I am saved by Jesus, my love for Him leads me to obey Him. Obedience is the result of salvation, not the means to it. It can only be born out of love for the One who died for me, and it is made possible by His grace working in me.

            <h2>Is there more evidence of this?</h2>
            <p>
              Even so <em>faith, if it hath not works, is dead</em>, being alone. Yea, a man may say, Thou hast faith, and I have works: shew me thy faith without thy works, and I will shew thee my faith by my works. Thou believest that there is one God; thou doest well: the devils also believe, and tremble. But wilt thou know, O vain man, that <em>faith without works is dead</em>?<cite><b>James 2:17-20</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              Do men gather grapes of thorns, or figs of thistles? Even so <em>every good tree bringeth forth good fruit; but a corrupt tree bringeth forth evil fruit</em>. ... Wherefore <em>by their fruits ye shall know them</em>. Not every one that saith unto me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of heaven; but <em>he that doeth the will of my Father</em> which is in heaven. Many will say to me in that day, Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied in thy name? and in thy name have cast out devils? and in thy name done many wonderful works? And then will I profess unto them, I never knew you: depart from me, ye that work iniquity.<cite><b>Matthew 7:16, 17, 20-23</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> Obedience shows the genuineness of my faith. Put another way, my faith is confirmed, or justified, to me by my works. They are evidence for me, not God, since He already knows my genuine heart (see Psalm 139:1-4), but I do need the evidence because it’s easy to deceive myself about my true condition (see Jeremiah 17:9, 10).

            <h2>What is God’s will regarding sin?</h2>
            <p>
              But <em>your iniquities have separated between you and your God</em>, and your sins have hid his face from you, that he will not hear. <cite><b>Isaiah 59:2</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              And she shall bring forth a son, and thou shalt call his name JESUS: for <em>he shall save his people from their sins</em>. <cite><b>Matthew 1:21</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just <em>to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness</em>. <cite><b>1 John 1:9</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              Who his own self bare our sins in his own body on the tree, that we, <em>being dead to sins, should live unto righteousness</em>: by whose stripes ye were healed. <cite><b>1 Peter 2:24</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> Before sin entered the world, Adam and Eve communicated with God face to face. Once they allowed sin to enter their hearts, it separated them from their Creator because sin cannot exist in the presence of a holy God&mdash;His presence is a consuming fire to those who cherish sin (see Deuteronomy 4:24). The Father then sent His Son not only to pay the penalty for sin on our behalf, but also to save us from our sins. He wants to forgive and cleanse us from any and all unrighteousness so that we may be dead to sin and alive to righteousness!

            <h2>What is the first step to victory over sin?</h2>
            <p>
               And if it seem evil unto you to serve the LORD, <em>choose you this day whom ye will serve</em>; whether the gods which your fathers served that were on the other side of the flood, or the gods of the Amorites, in whose land ye dwell: but as for me and my house, we will serve the LORD. <cite><b>Joshua 24:15</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> Sin is a choice, an act of the will because the devil cannot force anyone to sin. I get to choose whom I will serve every single day. Now it’s true that will power without God is my own power, but an act of the will is the first step on the road to victory. Sin can be defeated only if I cooperate with God; He will do for me what I cannot do for myself, but I need to do my part by making a firm choice to serve Him. Jesus raised Lazarus from the dead, but He didn’t roll away the stone because people were capable of doing that themselves. There is also a huge difference between desiring to overcome and choosing to overcome. God is powerless to help me until I make that choice, so whenever temptation comes, my first response can be “No, I choose to serve Christ.”

            <h2>What is the second step?</h2>
            <p>
               But <em>thanks be to God, which giveth us the victory</em> through our Lord Jesus Christ. <cite><b>1 Corinthians 15:57</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
               And Jesus answering saith unto them, <em>Have faith in God</em>. For verily I say unto you, That whosoever shall say unto this mountain, Be thou removed, and be thou cast into the sea; and shall not doubt in his heart, but shall believe that those things which he saith shall come to pass; he shall have whatsoever he saith. Therefore I say unto you, What things soever ye desire, when ye pray, <em>believe that ye receive them</em>, and ye shall have them. <cite><b>Mark 11:22-24</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
               And this is the confidence that we have in him, that, <em>if we ask any thing according to his will, he heareth us</em>. And if we know that he hear us, whatsoever we ask, we know that we have the petitions that we desired of him.  <cite><b>1 John 5:14, 15</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> The Bible is clear that it’s God will for me to have victory over sin. The Bible also says anything that I ask in faith according to His will He will do, and Paul even encourages me to thank God for the victory He gives me through Jesus. Just like the Israelites gave a loud shout of victory before the walls of Jericho came down (Joshua 6:16), I can claim that victory by faith and thank God for it. Faith in the power of God is crucial; it is the difference between merely asking for victory and believing it. The victory is a gift that needs to be received and accepted. So after saying “No, I choose to serve Christ,” my second response to temptation can be “Thank you God for the victory that is mine through Jesus.”

            <div>4</div>
            <h2>What is the third step?</h2>
            <p>
               Likewise <em>reckon ye also yourselves to be dead indeed unto sin</em>, but alive unto God through Jesus Christ our Lord. Let not sin therefore reign in your mortal body, that ye should obey it in the lusts thereof. Neither yield ye your members as instruments of unrighteousness unto sin: but yield yourselves unto God, as those that are alive from the dead, and your members as instruments of righteousness unto God. For sin shall not have dominion over you. <cite><b>Romans 6:11-14</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> Through the righteousness of Jesus and the power of the Holy Spirit in me I can be dead to sin. Temptation has no power over a corpse, and I can be just as dead to it. After thanking God for the victory, I can follow it up with “I am dead to this sin.” And remember, dying to sin is not divorcing a best friend, but an evil enemy. It is a cause for joy and celebration! So do not crawl, but run from it like Joseph did (Genesis 39:12).

            <h2>Is it smart to dwell on the temptation?</h2>
            <p>
              Blessed is the man that endureth temptation: for when he is tried, he shall receive the crown of life, which the Lord hath promised to them that love him. Let no man say when he is tempted, I am tempted of God: for God cannot be tempted with evil, neither tempteth he any man: but every man is tempted, when he is drawn away of his own lust, and enticed. Then <em>when lust hath conceived, it bringeth forth sin</em>: and sin, when it is finished, bringeth forth death. <cite><b>James 1:12-15</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              Wherefore <em>gird up the loins of your mind</em>, be sober, and hope to the end for the grace that is to be brought unto you at the revelation of Jesus Christ. <cite><b>1 Peter 1:13</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              Casting down imaginations, and every high thing that exalteth itself against the knowledge of God, and <em>bringing into captivity every thought to the obedience of Christ</em>. <cite><b>2 Corinthians 10:5</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              For <em>as he thinks</em> in his heart, <em>so is he</em>. <cite><b>Proverns 23:7</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> Sin occurs when the door of the mind is opened, and it’s then let inside and entertained. Temptation becomes sin when it’s cherished in the mind and, in the words of James, allowed to conceive sin. Peter calls us to bind the mind, like a soldier binds his belt in preparation for action, so the mind is ready to deal with temptation. Paul tells us to bring every thought into captivity to Christ since a sinful thought immediately rejected does not have strength. The faster I turn to God the safer I am, and the more I do it the easier it gets.

            <h2>How did Jesus meet temptation?</h2>
            <p>
              And when the tempter came to him, he said, If thou be the Son of God, command that these stones be made bread. But he answered and said, <em>It is written</em>, Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God. <cite><b>Matthew 4:3, 4</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              For <em>the word of God is living and powerful, and sharper than any two-edged sword</em>, piercing even to the division of soul and spirit, and of joints and marrow, and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart. <cite><b>Hebrews 4:12, NKJV</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              <em>Your word I have hidden in my heart</em>, that I might not sin against You. <cite><b>Psalm 119:11</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              But we all, with open face <em>beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord, are changed into the same image</em> from glory to glory, even as by the Spirit of the Lord. <cite><b>2 Corinthians 3:18</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> Jesus met temptation by quoting Scripture. Hebrews tells us the Bible is alive, powerful, and sharper than any sword. When I store His word in my mind by reading it daily and memorizing favorite passages, I am “girding” up my mind. Furthermore, I become what I behold, so by beholding the character of Christ as revealed in His word, my character will be transformed to reflect His character through the work of the Holy Spirit. The next time temptation comes, let’s follow the example of our Redeemer and turn to the Bible to give us victory!

            <p>
              But <em>put ye on the Lord Jesus Christ</em>, and <em>make not provision for the flesh</em>, to fulfil the lusts thereof. <cite><b>Romans 13:14</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              This I say then, <em>Walk in the Spirit</em>, and ye shall not fulfil the lust of the flesh. <cite><b>Galatians 5:16</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              <em>Commit thy works unto the LORD</em>, and thy thoughts shall be established. <cite><b>Proverbs 16:3</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              And if thy right hand offend thee, <em>cut it off</em>, and cast it from thee: for it is profitable for thee that one of thy members should perish, and not that thy whole body should be cast into hell. <cite><b>Matthew 5:30</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> The Bible invites me to “put on Christ” and “walk in the Spirit.” I do this by beginning every day sitting at His feet, like Mary did (Luke 10:39), reading His Word and asking Him to convert my heart and mind. Then I commit my will to Him for that day. And then I “make no provision for the flesh” by removing myself from temptation and doing all that I can to create an environment that is free from it. When I leave room for temptation I am telling myself I will fail, so throw it out, pour it out, delete the app, cancel the subscription, cut the cable.

              And <em>he arose, and came to his father. But when he was yet a great way off, his father saw him, and had compassion, and ran, and fell on his neck, and kissed him</em>. And the son said unto him, Father, I have sinned against heaven, and in thy sight, and am no more worthy to be called thy son. But the father said to his servants, Bring forth the best robe, and put it on him; and put a ring on his hand, and shoes on his feet: and bring hither the fatted calf, and kill it; and let us eat, and be merry: for this my son was dead, and is alive again; he was lost, and is found.

              <b>Note:</b> The walls of Jericho seemed insurmountable, and they were, as far as human strength was concerned (Numbers 13:28), but then the God of the universe got involved, and they crumbled like sand. The walls of sin in our lives are the same until we ask God to get involved and intervene on our behalf, and the promise is that Jesus Christ is mighty to pull them down! It’s not about how many times I’ve fallen, but whether I got up and went to the Father who is waiting for me with outstretched arms. I can never think of yourself as a hopeless case; it’s not from God. My past history is not my legacy or destiny. It’s not “I'd like to be an overcomer,” or “I hope to be.” Through the grace and power of Christ in my life I am an overcomer!

            <h2>What is the most powerful motivation for overcoming sin?</h2>
            <p>
              For the <em>preaching of the cross</em> is to them that perish foolishness; but <em>unto us which are saved it is the power of God</em>. <cite><b>1 Corinthians 1:18</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
               That Christ may dwell in your hearts by faith; that ye, <em>being rooted and grounded in love</em>, may be able to comprehend with all saints what is the breadth, and length, and depth, and height; and <em>to know the love of Christ</em>, which passeth knowledge, that ye might be filled with all the fulness of God. <cite><b>Ephesians 3:17-19</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
               <em>We love him</em>, because he first loved us. <cite><b>1 John 4:19</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> The more time I spend thinking about what Jesus did for me on the cross, the more my love for Him will grow and my abhorence for sin will increase. Sin is so evil that it required the Son of God to leave the courts of heaven, take on human nature, live a perfect life while assailed by the devil on every side, and die the death of the worse criminal on the cross because the Creator God was the only One who could pay the penalty for my sins. Let’s get grounded in the love of Christ as revealed on the cross, so it becomes the driving motivation for victory over sin. The more I love Him the more I’ll hate those things that separate me from Him and are repulsive to His character.

            <h2>What does Revelation say about those who overcome?</h2>
            <p>
              And <em>they overcame him by the blood of the Lamb</em>, and by the word of their testimony; and they loved not their lives unto the death. <cite><b>Revelation 12:11</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              <em>To him that overcometh will I grant to sit with me on my throne</em>, even as I also overcame, and am set down with my Father on his throne. <cite><b>Revelation 3:21</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              The four and twenty elders fall down before him that sat on the throne, and worship him that liveth for ever and ever, and <em>cast their crowns before the throne, saying, Thou art worthy, O Lord, to receive glory and honour and power</em>: for thou hast created all things, and for thy pleasure they are and were created. <cite><b>Revelation 4:10, 11</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> There is power in what Jesus did on the cross because Revelation says the saints overcame Satan by the blood of Jesus Christ. He gives them the victory, and then He grants them to sit on His throne! This is an echo of how the Father treated His prodigal son. Such treatment is completely undeserved, but He does it anyway out of His immeasurable love for His children. No wonder the saints in heaven will cast their crowns before His throne in worship and adoration saying that He is worthy to receive glory, honor, and power.

              I beseech you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God, <em>that ye present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God</em>, which is your reasonable service. And be not conformed to this world: but <em>be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind</em>, that ye may prove what is that good, and acceptable, and perfect, will of God. <cite><b>Romans 12:1, 2</b></cite>

              Whether therefore ye eat, or drink, or <em>whatsoever ye do, do all to the glory of God</em>. <cite><b>1 Corinthians 10:31</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              But <em>my God shall supply all your need</em> according to his riches in glory by Christ Jesus. <cite><b>Philippians 3:19</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              <em>Ask, and it shall be given you</em>; seek, and ye shall find; knock, and it shall be opened unto you: for every one that asketh receiveth; and he that seeketh findeth; and to him that knocketh it shall be opened. <cite><b>Matthew 7:7, 8</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> Paul invites me to bring God glory in everything that I do, including the things I eat and drink. This is a high standard that I cannot reach in my own power, but God has made ample provision for this to become a reality in my life by the grace and power of Christ, as long as I do not frustrate His grace with a perverse will. If I ask Jesus to help me live a life that glorifies Him then He will gladly answer that prayer. And because God is love (1 John 4:8), His glory is my good.

            <p>
              <em>Wine is a mocker, strong drink is raging</em>: and whosoever is deceived thereby is not wise. <cite><b>Proverbs 20:1</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              Who hath woe? who hath sorrow? who hath contentions? who hath babbling? who hath wounds without cause? who hath redness of eyes? They that tarry long at the wine; they that go to seek mixed wine. <em>Look not thou upon the wine</em> when it is red, when it giveth his colour in the cup, when it moveth itself aright. <em>At the last it biteth like a serpent, and stingeth like an adder</em>. <cite><b>Proverbs 23:29-32</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              <em>Woe unto them</em> that rise up early in the morning, <em>that they may follow strong drink</em>; that continue until night, till wine inflame them! <cite><b>Isaiah 5:11</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              For they eat the bread of wickedness, and <em>drink the wine of violence</em>. <cite><b>Proverbs 4:17</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> The Bible is clear and direct in its condemnation of wine and other alcoholic beverages, and science is now agreeing too. Studies have shown that alcohol is toxic to the cells and no amount is actually safe. Wine does contain beneficial flavonoids that help fight free radicals in the body, but so does grape juice!

            <h2>Why should I not consume alcohol?</h2>
            <p>
              It is not for kings, O Lemuel, <em>it is not for kings to drink wine; nor for princes strong drink</em>: lest they drink, and forget the law, and pervert the judgment of any of the afflicted. <cite><b>Proverbs 31:4, 5</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              And they sung a new song, saying, Thou art worthy to take the book, and to open the seals thereof: for thou wast slain, and hast redeemed us to God by thy blood out of every kindred, and tongue, and people, and nation; and hast <em>made us unto our God kings and priests</em>: and we shall reign on the earth. <cite><b>Revelation 5:9, 10</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              Wherefore <em>gird up the loins of your mind, be sober</em>, and hope to the end for the grace that is to be brought unto you at the revelation of Jesus Christ. <cite><b>1 Peter 1:13</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              Finally, my brethren, be strong in the Lord, and in the power of his might. Put on the whole armour of God, that ye may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil. <em>For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places</em>. <cite><b>Ephesians 6:10-12</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> Proverbs plainly says that alcoholic drinks pervert the judgment, and as such, they are not suitable for kings and princes. In Revelation we learn that we are made to be kings and priests to God, which is why Peter calls us to be sober, to bind the mind for action, like a soldier binds his belt in preparation for battle, because our battle is not with flesh and blood; it’s a battle with spiritual forces, and the outcome has eternal consequences.

            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> Meat was added to the diet after the flood because when Noah stepped off the ark all the vegetation had been destroyed. But God made a distinction between clean and unclean animals because seven pairs of every clean animal came onto the ark and only two pairs of the unclean, so Noah and his family were allowed to eat every clean animal, as long as the blood was drained.

Nevertheless these shall ye not eat of them that chew the cud, or of them that divide the hoof: as the camel, because he cheweth the cud, but divideth not the hoof; he is unclean unto you. And the coney, because he cheweth the cud, but divideth not the hoof; he is unclean unto you. And the hare, because he cheweth the cud, but divideth not the hoof; he is unclean unto you. And the swine, though he divide the hoof, and be clovenfooted, yet he cheweth not the cud; he is unclean to you. Of their flesh shall ye not eat, and their carcase shall ye not touch; they are unclean to you.
              <br><br>
              These shall ye eat of all that are in the waters: <em>whatsoever hath fins and scales in the waters, in the seas, and in the rivers, them shall ye eat</em>. And all that have not fins and scales in the seas, and in the rivers, of all that move in the waters, and of any living thing which is in the waters, they shall be an abomination unto you: they shall be even an abomination unto you; ye shall not eat of their flesh, but ye shall have their carcases in abomination.

These laws are not just for the Jewish nation because Noah was not Jewish, and they were not done away with at the cross because our physiology did not change at the cross.

              For the LORD God is a sun and shield: the LORD will give grace and glory: <em>no good thing will he withhold from them that walk uprightly</em>. <cite><b>Psalm 84:11</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              And said, If thou wilt diligently hearken to the voice of the LORD thy God, and wilt do that which is right in his sight, and wilt give ear to his commandments, and keep all his statutes, I will put none of these diseases upon thee, which I have brought upon the Egyptians: <em>for I am the LORD that healeth thee</em>. <cite><b>Exodus 15:26</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>

            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> We are not to consume unclean animals because they are detrimental to our health. God’s mission is to bring healing into our bodies and minds, so He never withholds anything that is good for us. He is also far better at pleasure and happiness than Satan because His way does not lead to a crash after the high, or desensitization that requires increasingly higher doses, or addiction. It may seem difficult, overwhelming, or even impossible to make these dietary changes, but when I don’t have the willpower myself, I can give Him my will, and He will give me the power.

            <p>
              On the morrow, as they went on their journey, and drew nigh unto the city, Peter went up upon the housetop to pray about the sixth hour: and he became very hungry, and would have eaten: but while they made ready, he fell into a trance, and saw heaven opened, and a certain vessel descending unto him, as it had been a great sheet knit at the four corners, and let down to the earth: wherein were all manner of fourfooted beasts of the earth, and wild beasts, and creeping things, and fowls of the air. And there came a voice to him, Rise, Peter; kill, and eat. But Peter said, <em>Not so, Lord; for I have never eaten any thing that is common or unclean</em>. And the voice spake unto him again the second time, What God hath cleansed, that call not thou common. This was done thrice: and the vessel was received up again into heaven. <cite><b>Acts 10:9-16</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              And he said unto them, Ye know how that it is an unlawful thing for a man that is a Jew to keep company, or come unto one of another nation; but <em>God hath shewed me that I should not call any man common or unclean</em>. <cite><b>Acts 10:28</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> The subject of Peter’s vision was people, not animals. God was telling him that he should not view Gentiles as unclean because he was about to have Gentile visitors, whom he would have refused to see, as Jewish law forbade associating with Gentiles (Acts 10:28), but after receiving this vision, Peter welcomed them.

              I am sought of them that asked not for me; I am found of them that sought me not: I said, Behold me, behold me, unto a nation that was not called by my name. <em>I have spread out my hands all the day unto a rebellious people, which walketh in a way that was not good, after their own thoughts</em>; a people that provoketh me to anger continually to my face; that sacrificeth in gardens, and burneth incense upon altars of brick; which remain among the graves, and lodge in the monuments, <em>which eat swine's flesh, and broth of abominable things is in their vessels</em>; which say, Stand by thyself, come not near to me; for I am holier than thou. These are a smoke in my nose, a fire that burneth all the day. <cite><b>Isaiah 65:1-5</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              For, behold, the LORD will come with fire, and with his chariots like a whirlwind, to render his anger with fury, and his rebuke with flames of fire. For by fire and by his sword will the LORD plead with all flesh: and the slain of the LORD shall be many. They that sanctify themselves, and purify themselves in the gardens behind one tree in the midst, <em>eating swine's flesh, and the abomination, and the mouse, shall be consumed together</em>, saith the LORD. <cite><b>Isaiah 66:15-17</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              Say unto them, As I live, saith the Lord GOD, <em>I have no pleasure in the death of the wicked</em>; but that the wicked turn from his way and live: <em>turn ye, turn ye from your evil ways; for why will ye die, O house of Israel</em>? <cite><b>Ezekiel 33:11</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> God cannot save those who knowingly go down the path of destruction, nor does He enjoy destroying them, but eventually there will come a point when He can do nothing else but leave them to the consequences of their own destructive choices.

            <h2>What promise does the Bible give?</h2>
            <p>
              For we have not a high priest which cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities; but <em>was in all points tempted like as we are</em>, yet without sin. Let us therefore <em>come boldly unto the throne of grace, that we may obtain mercy, and find grace</em> to help in time of need. <cite><b>Hebrews 4:15, 16</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> Jesus knows my struggles because He experienced them Himself, and so He bids me to come to His throne that I may receive mercy and grace to meet them with boldness and overcome.

            <p>
              These things said he: and after that he saith unto them, <em>Our friend Lazarus sleepeth</em>; but I go, that I may awake him out of sleep. Then said his disciples, Lord, if he sleep, he shall do well. Howbeit <em>Jesus spake of his death</em>: but they thought that he had spoken of taking of rest in sleep. Then said Jesus unto them plainly, <em>Lazarus is dead</em>. <cite><b>John 11:11-14</b></cite>

            <h2>Will there be a resurrection?</h2>
            <p>
              For this we say unto you by the word of the Lord, that we which are alive and remain unto the coming of the Lord shall not prevent them which are asleep. For the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the archangel, and with the trump of God: and <em>the dead in Christ shall rise first</em>. <cite><b>1 Thessalonians 4:15, 16</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              <em>I am he that liveth, and was dead</em>; and, behold, I am alive for evermore, amen; and <em>have the keys of hell and of death</em>. <cite><b>Revelation 1:18</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> Jesus uses the state of sleep as a metaphor for death because He knows there will be a resurrection at the second coming. This will be a resurrection of those who died in Christ because He was the only One who conquered death.

            <p>
              Marvel not at this: for the hour is coming, in the which all that are in the graves shall hear his voice, and shall come forth; <em>they that have done good, unto the resurrection of life</em>; and <em>they that have done evil, unto the resurrection of damnation</em>. <cite><b>John 5:28, 29</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> John makes it clear there will be two resurrections for two different groups of people: those who, through the grace of Christ, reflected goodness in their life will be part of the resurrection of life, which takes place at the second coming of Jesus, while those who lived unrighteous lives will be part of the resurrection of damnation.

              And the LORD <em>God formed man of the dust of the ground</em>, and <em>breathed into his nostrils the breath of life</em>; and man became a living soul. <cite><b>Genesis 2:7</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> God made man by forming him from the dust of the ground and breathing into him the breath of life. In other words, dust (the body) plus breath of God equals a living soul.

            </p>
            <p class="note">

            <h2>What is the spirit that returns to God?</h2>
            <p>
              All the while <em>my breath is in me</em>, and <em>the spirit of God is in my nostrils</em>. <cite><b>Job 27:3</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              For as <em>the body without the spirit is dead</em>, so faith without works is dead also. <cite><b>James 2:26</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> The spirit that returns to God is simply the breath of life, without which the body dies. In other words, the process described in Ecclesiastes 12:7 is the opposite of what happened in Genesis 2:7. If a soul is a combination of two things&mdash;the body and the breath of life (spirit)&mdash;then the soul ceases to exist when the body returns to dust and the breath returns to God. The soul does not go anywhere; it simply ceases to exist. As an illustration, consider what is needed for light: there needs to be an electrical current and a bulb. As soon as the electrical current is turned off, the light simply ceases to exist. It is the same with the soul.

            <h2>What else does the Bible about the soul?</h2>
            <p>
              Behold, all souls are mine; as the soul of the father, so also the soul of the son is mine: the <em>soul that sinneth, it shall die</em>. <cite><b>Ezekiel 18:4</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              For <em>the wages of sin is death</em>; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord. <cite><b>Romans 6:23</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              For <em>all have sinned</em>, and come short of the glory of God. <cite><b>Romans 3:23</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> A person’s soul or spirit cannot go to heaven or hell after death because the Bible is clear that the soul that sins shall die. Why is this the case? Because the wages of sin are death, and all have sinned.

              Men and brethren, let me freely speak unto you of the patriarch David, that <em>he is both dead and buried</em>, and his sepulchre is with us unto this day. ...

            <p>
              Put not your trust in princes, nor in the son of man, in whom there is no help. <em>His breath goeth forth, he returneth to his earth; in that very day his thoughts perish</em>. <cite><b>Psalm 146:3, 4</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> Since the spirit is simply the breath then it is not possible for the spirit to exist after death. Here the psalmist describes the same process of death that was described in the previous verses: the breath leaving the body and returning to God who gave it, the body returning to dust (the earth), and when these two things happen all conscious thought ceases to exist.

            <p>
              For the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the archangel, and with the trump of God: and the dead in Christ shall rise first: then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air: and <em>so shall we ever be with the Lord</em>. <cite><b>1 Thessalonians 4:16, 17</b></cite>

So when this corruptible shall have put on incorruption, and this mortal shall have put on immortality, then shall be brought to pass the saying that is written, <em>Death is swallowed up in victory</em>. <cite><b>1 Corinthians 15:51-54</b></cite>

              <b>Note:</b> 1 Corinthians 15 says that not all the righteous will experience death, but all the righteous will be changed when the trumpet of God sounds at the second coming. In other words, the righteous who are live to see the second coming, as well as those who died in Christ, who will at that moment be resurrected, will receive new, immortal bodies. From that point on death will never have power over them because Jesus defeated it, and by accepting His sacrifice on their behalf, they will inherit His victory over it!

              <b>Note:</b> Jesus could not have gone to heaven after His death because on Sunday morning He told Mary He hadn’t yet ascended to His Father. It’s a little know fact, but the original Bible text did not have any punctuation. It was added centuries later by translators who could have placed the comma before the word “today” due to their own beliefs about death. The better place for the comma would be after the word “today” because then it would be in harmony with all the other Bible texts regarding death. Jesus was promising the thief on the cross that day&mdash;when it did not look like He could save anyone&mdash;that he would be with Him in Paradise one day when He returns to take all of His children home to heaven.

And he said, <em>I will go forth, and I will be a lying spirit in the mouth of all his prophets</em>. And he said, Thou shalt persuade him, and prevail also: go forth, and do so. <cite><b>1 Kings 22:21, 22</b></cite>

              <b>Note:</b> It could not have been Samuel that Saul saw because the Bible is clear that the dead remain dead until the resurrection. In Revelation we learn that the devil has fallen angels whom he was able to persuade to join his rebellion in heaven, and after he was cast to the Earth, they were cast down with him (Revelation 12:4). In other places, they are called “lying spirits” and “spirits of devils” who have the power to work miracles, including masquerading as human beings. In fact, Satan Himself is able to appear as an angel of light (2 Corinthians 11:14). Saul saw one of these spirits masquerading as Samuel.

            <h2>What does the Bible say about communication with spirits?</h2>
            <p>
              <em>Do not turn to mediums or spiritists; do not seek them out to be defiled by them</em>. I am the LORD your God. <cite><b>Leviticus 19:31, NASB</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              There shall not be found among you any one that maketh his son or his daughter to pass through the fire, <em>or that useth divination, or an observer of times, or an enchanter, or a witch, or a charmer, or a consulter with familiar spirits, or a wizard, or a necromancer. For all that do these things are an abomination unto the LORD</em>: and because of these abominations the LORD thy God doth drive them out from before thee. <cite><b>Deuteronomy 18:10-12</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              Now the Spirit speaketh expressly, that in the latter times some shall depart from the faith, <em>giving heed to seducing spirits, and doctrines of devils</em>. <cite><b>1 Timothy 4:1</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              And when they say to you, “Seek those who are mediums and wizards, who whisper and mutter,” should not a people seek their God? Should they seek the dead on behalf of the living? <em>To the law and to the testimony! If they do not speak according to this word, it is because there is no light in them</em>. <cite><b>Isaiah 8:19, 20, NKJV</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> Communication with spirits is forbidden in the Bible because it’s an abomination to God. Paul also warns that this practice is one of the signs of the last days, and it will lead to deception and a departure from the faith, meaning it will be practiced by those who claim to be believers. Isaiah says that the only way to identify whether a spirit is from God or not is to compare what it says with the Word of God because every lying spirit will speak contrary to His Word.

            <h2>What did Jesus promise before ascending to heaven?</h2>
            <p>
              Let not your heart be troubled: ye believe in God, believe also in me. In my Father's house are many mansions: if it were not so, I would have told you. <em>I go to prepare a place for you</em>. And if I go and prepare a place for you, <em>I will come again, and receive you unto myself; that where I am, there ye may be also</em>. <cite><b>John 14:1-3</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> Jesus said He would go to heaven to prepare a place there for His children, but He promised He would then come back again to take them up to heaven to live there with Him!

            <h2>Was this promise repeated during His ascension?</h2>
            <p>
              And when he had spoken these things, while they beheld, he was taken up; and a cloud received him out of their sight. And while they looked stedfastly toward heaven as he went up, behold, two men stood by them in white apparel; which also said, Ye men of Galilee, why stand ye gazing up into heaven? <em>this same Jesus, which is taken up from you into heaven, shall so come in like manner as ye have seen him go into heaven</em>. <cite><b>Acts 1:9-11</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> The promise was repeated by the two angels who appeared to His disciples during Jesus’ ascension. They said He would return in the same bodily, personal manner as they saw Him ascending into heaven.

            <h2>What will happen during Jesus’ second coming?</h2>
            <p>
              For the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the archangel, and with the trump of God: and <em>the dead in Christ shall rise first: then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air</em>: and so shall we ever be with the Lord. <cite><b>1 Thessalonians 4:16, 17</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              I am he that liveth, and was dead; and, behold, I am alive for evermore, amen; and <em>have the keys of hell and of death</em>. <cite><b>Revelation 1:18</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              And there were voices, and thunders, and lightnings; and <em>there was a great earthquake, such as was not since men were upon the earth, so mighty an earthquake, and so great</em>. And the great city was divided into three parts, and the cities of the nations fell: and great Babylon came in remembrance before God, to give unto her the cup of the wine of the fierceness of his wrath. And <em>every island fled away, and the mountains were not found. And there fell upon men a great hail out of heaven, every stone about the weight of a talent</em>: and men blasphemed God because of the plague of the hail; for the plague thereof was exceeding great. <cite><b>Revelation 16:18-21</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> Because Jesus conquered death, all those who died in Him throughout the ages will be resurrected at His coming and, together with the righteous who remained alive, will be taken up to live with Him in heaven, never to be separated from Him again! But the Earth will be destroyed by the most devastating earthquake and hailstorm since the creation of Adam and Eve. Revelation says the hail will weigh about a talent, which is about 75 pounds, and the earthquake will cause every island as well as the mountains to move out of its place!

            </p>
            <p>
              <em>In flaming fire</em> taking vengeance on them that know not God, and that obey not the gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ. <cite><b>2 Thessalonians 1:8</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              And then shall that Wicked be revealed, whom the Lord shall consume with the spirit of his mouth, and <em>shall destroy with the brightness of his coming</em>. <cite><b>2 Thessalonians 2:8</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              And I saw heaven opened, and behold a white horse; and he that sat upon him was called Faithful and True, and in righteousness he doth judge and make war. <em>His eyes were as a flame of fire</em>, and on his head were many crowns; and he had a name written, that no man knew, but he himself. And he was clothed with a vesture dipped in blood: and his name is called The Word of God. And the armies which were in heaven followed him upon white horses, clothed in fine linen, white and clean. And out of his mouth goeth a sharp sword, that with it he should smite the nations: and he shall rule them with a rod of iron: and he treadeth the winepress of the fierceness and wrath of Almighty God. And he hath on his vesture and on his thigh a name written, KING OF KINGS, AND LORD OF LORDS.
              <br><br>
              And I saw an angel standing in the sun; and he cried with a loud voice, saying to all the fowls that fly in the midst of heaven, Come and gather yourselves together unto the supper of the great God; that ye may eat the flesh of kings, and the flesh of captains, and the flesh of mighty men, and the flesh of horses, and of them that sit on them, and the flesh of all men, both free and bond, both small and great.
              <br><br>
              And I saw the beast, and the kings of the earth, and their armies, gathered together to make war against him that sat on the horse, and against his army. And the beast was taken, and with him the false prophet that wrought miracles before him, with which he deceived them that had received the mark of the beast, and them that worshipped his image. These both were cast alive <em>into a lake of fire</em> burning with brimstone. And <em>the remnant were slain with the sword of him that sat upon the horse, which sword proceeded out of his mouth: and all the fowls were filled with their flesh</em>. <cite><b>Revelation 19:11-21</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> Because sin cannot exist in the presence of a holy God, to everyone who didn’t accept Jesus’ sacrifice on their behalf so He could cover their sins the second coming will be like a consuming fire because they will have to pay for their sins themselves. Revelation 19 uses symbolic imagery to describe how they will be destroyed by the brightness of His holy presence.

            <p>
              And I saw an angel come down from heaven, having the key of the bottomless pit and a great chain in his hand. And <em>he laid hold on the dragon, that old serpent, which is the Devil, and Satan, and bound him a thousand years</em>. <cite><b>Revelation 20:1, 2</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> The chain described here is a symbolic chain of circumstances because Satan will be confined to planet Earth without anyone to tempt or deceive since the saved are in heaven and the unsaved are dead, and for the first time since his rebellion in heaven, he is deprived of his power. This will be his fate for 1,000 years. It is interesting to note that the Greek word for “bottomless pit” is “abussos,” or abyss, and it is the same word used in Genesis 1:2 for the word “deep,” meaning the Earth will resemble its original state during this time.

              <b>Note:</b>  The second coming of Jesus kills the unrighteous due to the brightness and holiness of His presence, and they remain dead during the 1,000 years, meaning they will not have an opportunity to repent because the time to do so has run out.

They will not be determining who is saved or lost because God will have already determined that (see “Judgment”), but the cases of all who are lost, including Satan and his angels, will be reviewed, and the fairness of God’s judgment will be confirmed.

              And I John <em>saw the holy city, new Jerusalem, coming down from God out of heaven</em>, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband. <cite><b>Revelation 21:2</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              And his feet shall stand in that day upon the mount of Olives, which is before Jerusalem on the east, and <em>the mount of Olives shall cleave in the midst thereof toward the east and toward the west, and there shall be a very great valley</em>; and half of the mountain shall remove toward the north, and half of it toward the south. ... and the <em>LORD my God shall come, and all the saints with thee</em>. ... And the <em>LORD shall be king over all the earth</em>: in that day shall there be one LORD, and his name one. <cite><b>Zechariah 14:4, 5, 9</b></cite>

            <p>
              Marvel not at this: for the hour is coming, in the which all that are in the graves shall hear his voice, and shall come forth; <em>they that have done good, unto the resurrection of life</em>; and <em>they that have done evil, unto the resurrection of damnation</em>. <cite><b>John 5:28, 29</b></cite>

              <b>Note:</b> At the end of the 1,000 years Jesus will return to Earth for the third time, and the New Jerusalem will descend from heaven with all the saved.

And just like the resurrection of the saved marked the beginning of the 1,000 year period, the end of this period will be marked by a second resurrection, and this one is of the unsaved of all ages.

              And <em>I saw a great white throne, and him that sat on it</em>, from whose face the earth and the heaven fled away; and there was found no place for them. And <em>I saw the dead, small and great, stand before God; and the books were opened</em>: and another book was opened, which is the book of life: and the <em>dead were judged out of those things which were written in the books, according to their works</em>. <cite><b>Revelation 20:11, 12</b></cite>

But God’s throne will suddenly appear, bringing the attack to a halt and beginning the final phase of the judgment. The wicked will see their life pass before them and realize that God did everything He could to save them from their life of sin, but they did not heed Him, and without the sacrifice of Jesus covering their sins, they are left to pay for their own sins.

This is the second death from which there is no resurrection, marking the end of the controversy between God and Satan, good and evil. For the God of love (1 John 4:8), this will be a difficult thing to watch because every single person who is destroyed is one whom He loved and for whom Jesus died. He did everything He could to save them, but they persistently rejected Him, and so He has no other option left. Once there is nothing but ashes left (Malachi 4:3), the fire will go out, and the universe will finally be free from sin.

              The LORD hath appeared of old unto me, saying, Yea, <em>I have loved thee with an everlasting love</em>: therefore with lovingkindness have I drawn thee. <cite><b>Jeremiah 31:3</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              But <em>as he which hath called you is holy, so be ye holy</em> in all manner of conversation; because it is written, Be ye holy; for I am holy. <cite><b>1 Peter 1:15, 16</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              Take heed unto yourselves, lest ye forget the covenant of the LORD your God, which he made with you, and make you a graven image, or the likeness of any thing, which the LORD thy God hath forbidden thee. <em>For the LORD thy God is a consuming fire</em>, even a jealous God. <cite><b>Deuteronomy 4:23, 24</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> God is love, but He is also holy. He loves the sinner and has made ample provision for salvation from sin, because sin, and anyone who chooses to cling to it, cannot exist in the presence of a holy God&mdash;He is a consuming fire to it.

            <h2>What does the Bible say about the wicked?</h2>
            <p>
              Say unto them, As I live, saith the Lord GOD, <em>I have no pleasure in the death of the wicked</em>; but that the wicked turn from his way and live: <em>turn ye, turn ye from your evil ways; for why will ye die, O house of Israel</em>? <cite><b>Ezekiel 33:11</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              For the LORD shall rise up as in mount Perazim, he shall be wroth as in the valley of Gibeon, that he may do his work, <em>his strange work</em>; and bring to pass his act, <em>his strange act</em>. <cite><b>Isaiah 28:21</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              For, behold, <em>the day cometh, that shall burn as an oven; and all the proud, yea, and all that do wickedly, shall be stubble: and the day that cometh shall burn them up</em>, saith the LORD of hosts, that it shall leave them neither root nor branch. But unto you that fear my name shall the Sun of righteousness arise with healing in his wings; and ye shall go forth, and grow up as calves of the stall. And ye shall tread down the wicked; for they <em>shall be ashes</em> under the soles of your feet in the day that I shall do this, saith the LORD of hosts. <cite><b>Malachi 4:1-3</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> Because the wicked choose to cling to sin, which, at its core, is selfishness and in complete opposition to the government of love, God has no other choice but to destroy them. The Bible calls this a strange act because God has no pleasure in the death of the wicked; these are people for whom He died, but because they refuse to turn from their path of sin and destruction, He must respect their choice and leave them to its consequences so that the curse of sin&mdash;the misery, suffering, and ruin&mdash;can be finally blotted out. Note also that Malachi says the fire will burn them up and turn them into ashes, meaning they will not burn in hell forever.

              For yet a little while, and <em>the wicked shall not be</em>: yea, thou shalt diligently consider his place, and it shall not be. <cite><b>Psalm 37:10</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              But the wicked <em>shall perish</em>, and the enemies of the LORD shall be as the fat of lambs: they shall consume; <em>into smoke shall they consume away</em>. <cite><b>Psalm 37:20</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              Yet he passed away, and, lo, he was not: yea, I sought him, but <em>he could not be found</em>. <cite><b>Psalm 37:36</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> These verses are clear that the wicked will cease to exist after the fire finishes its work. They will not be suffering in hell for eternity.

            <h2>How is the fire of Sodom and Gomorrha described?</h2>
            <p>
              Even as Sodom and Gomorrha, and the cities about them in like manner, giving themselves over to fornication, and going after strange flesh, are set forth for an example, suffering the vengeance of <em>eternal fire</em>. <cite><b>Jude 7</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              And <em>turning the cities of Sodom and Gomorrha into ashes</em> condemned them with an overthrow, making them an ensample unto those that after should live ungodly. <cite><b>2 Peter 2:6</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> The fire that destroyed Sodom and Gomorrha was an eternal fire too, but, obviously, the cities are no longer burning. The Bible is referring to the eternal consequences of the fire, which turned the cities into ashes&mdash;never to exist again.

            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> The fire is unquenchable in the sense that nothing can put it out until it finishes its work.

            <h2>Is there another instance of this in the Bible?</h2>
            <p>
              Thus saith the LORD; Take heed to yourselves, and bear no burden on the sabbath day, nor bring it in by the gates of Jerusalem; neither carry forth a burden out of your houses on the sabbath day, neither do ye any work, but hallow ye the sabbath day, as I commanded your fathers. But they obeyed not, neither inclined their ear, but made their neck stiff, that they might not hear, nor receive instruction.
              <br><br>
              And it shall come to pass, if ye diligently hearken unto me, saith the LORD, to bring in no burden through the gates of this city on the sabbath day, but hallow the sabbath day, to do no work therein; then shall there enter into the gates of this city kings and princes sitting upon the throne of David, riding in chariots and on horses, they, and their princes, the men of Judah, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem: and this city shall remain for ever. And they shall come from the cities of Judah, and from the places about Jerusalem, and from the land of Benjamin, and from the plain, and from the mountains, and from the south, bringing burnt offerings, and sacrifices, and meat offerings, and incense, and bringing sacrifices of praise, unto the house of the LORD.
              <br><br>
              But if ye will not hearken unto me to hallow the sabbath day, and not to bear a burden, even entering in at the gates of Jerusalem on the sabbath day; <em>then will I kindle a fire in the gates thereof, and it shall devour the palaces of Jerusalem, and it shall not be quenched</em>. <cite><b>Jeremiah 17:19-27</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              Then <em>they burned the house of God, broke down the wall of Jerusalem, burned all its palaces with fire, and destroyed all its precious possessions</em>. And those who escaped from the sword he carried away to Babylon, where they became servants to him and his sons until the rule of the kingdom of Persia, to fulfill the word of the Lord by the mouth of Jeremiah, until the land had enjoyed her Sabbaths. As long as she lay desolate she kept Sabbath, to fulfill seventy years. <cite><b>2 Chronicles 36:21-27</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> 2 Chronicles 36 was the fulfillment of the prophecy given by Jeremiah in chapter 17. Obviously, the fire is no longer burning, but when it was burning, it was an unquenchable fire that could not be put out until it consumed everything.

            <h2>What about Revelation 20:10?</h2>
            <p>
              And the devil that deceived them was cast into the lake of fire and brimstone, where the beast and the false prophet are, and <em>shall be tormented day and night for ever and ever</em>. <cite><b>Revelation 20:10</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              Then his master shall bring him unto the judges; he shall also bring him to the door, or unto the door post; and his master shall bore his ear through with an aul; and <em>he shall serve him for ever</em>. <cite><b>Exodus 21:6</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              But Hannah went not up; for she said unto her husband, I will not go up until the child be weaned, and then I will bring him, that he may appear before the LORD, and <em>there abide for ever</em>. ... Therefore also I have lent him to the LORD; <em>as long as he liveth</em> he shall be lent to the LORD. And he worshipped the LORD there. <cite><b>1 Samuel 1:22, 28</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> The Greek word for “for ever” in Revelation 20:20 is “aion.” It’s where the word “eon” comes from. In the Bible it’s often used to indicate an unspecified period of time. In Exodus 21:6 it represents the life of a slave, and in 1 Samuel 1:22, 28 it means as long as Samuel lives; likewise, in Revelation 20:10 it means the torment lasts until death brings it to an end.

            <h2>Where and when will the fire come down?</h2>
            <p>
              As therefore the tares are gathered and burned in the fire; so <em>shall it be in the end of this world</em>. The Son of man shall send forth his angels, and they shall gather out of his kingdom all things that offend, and them which do iniquity; and <em>shall cast them into a furnace of fire</em>: there shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth. <cite><b>Matthew 13:40-42</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              But the day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night; in the which the heavens shall pass away with a great noise, and the elements shall melt with fervent heat, <em>the earth also and the works that are therein shall be burned up</em>. <cite><b>2 Peter 3:10</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              And they went up on the breadth of the earth, and compassed the camp of the saints about, and the beloved city: and <em>fire came down from God out of heaven, and devoured them</em>. <cite><b>Revelation 20:9</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> The Bible says the fire comes down on Earth at the end of the 1,000 year period when the wicked are raised from the dead and Satan deceives them, for the last time, to make an attempt to capture the New Jerusalem (see “Millenium”). This is referred to as “the end of the world” in other Bible passages because it is God’s final act of cleansing the world of sin. This also means there is no one burning in hell now. The Bible makes it clear that the dead are in their graves waiting for the resurrection: the saved are waiting for the first resurrection at the second coming of Christ (see “State of the Dead”), while the lost are waiting for the second resurrection at the end of the 1,000 years (see “Millenium”).

              For if God <em>spared not the angels that sinned, but cast them down to hell</em>, and delivered them into chains of darkness, to be reserved unto judgment. <cite><b>2 Peter 2:4</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              Thine heart was lifted up because of thy beauty, thou hast corrupted thy wisdom by reason of thy brightness: I will cast thee to the ground, I will lay thee before kings, that they may behold thee. Thou hast defiled thy sanctuaries by the multitude of thine iniquities, by the iniquity of thy traffick; therefore will I bring forth a fire from the midst of thee, it shall devour thee, and I will bring thee to ashes upon the earth in the sight of all them that behold thee. <cite><b>Ezekiel 28:17, 18</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> The fire cleanses the Earth from all traces of sin, and so the fallen angels, including Satan, will also be destroyed by it because the entire rebellion against God started with Satan and the angels he managed to deceive (see “Origin of Evil”).

            <h2>What is the result of the fire?</h2>
            <p>
              For <em>the wages of sin is death</em>; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord. <cite><b>Romans 6:23</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              Behold, they shall be as stubble; <em>the fire shall burn them</em>; they shall not deliver themselves from the power of the flame: <em>there shall not be a coal to warm at, nor fire to sit before it</em>. <cite><b>Isaiah 47:14</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              For the day of the LORD is near upon all the heathen: as thou hast done, it shall be done unto thee: thy reward shall return upon thine own head. For as ye have drunk upon my holy mountain, so shall all the heathen drink continually, yea, they shall drink, and they shall swallow down, and <em>they shall be as though they had not been</em>. <cite><b>Obadiah 15, 16</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> Hell cannot burn forever because the wages of sin are death, not eternal torment for a short life of sin. How cruel would that be! Jesus would rather die on a cross Himself than watch His creation destroyed by fire, but He also respects every person’s freedom of choice, and in an effort to purge the world from the misery of sin, it is, ultimately, an act of love to bring the rebellion to an end. And so the fire will burn out once it finishes its work, and there will be not a coal left to warm at. Satan, his angels, and the wicked will cease to exist, never to live again.

            <p>
              Looking for and hasting unto the coming of the day of God, wherein the heavens being on fire shall be dissolved, and the elements shall melt with fervent heat? Nevertheless we, according to his promise, look for <em>new heavens and a new earth, wherein dwelleth righteousness</em>. <cite><b>2 Peter 3:12, 13</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              And <em>I saw a new heaven and a new earth: for the first heaven and the first earth were passed away</em>; and there was no more sea. And I John saw the holy city, new Jerusalem, coming down from God out of heaven, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband. And I heard a great voice out of heaven saying, Behold, the tabernacle of God is with men, and he will dwell with them, and they shall be his people, and God himself shall be with them, and be their God. And <em>God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes; and there shall be no more death, neither sorrow, nor crying, neither shall there be any more pain: for the former things are passed away</em>. <cite><b>Revelation 21:1-4</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              What do ye imagine against the LORD? he will make an utter end: <em>affliction shall not rise up the second time</em>. <cite><b>Nahum 1:9</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> Once every trace of sin is wiped out, God will create a new heaven and a new Earth in which righteousness dwells. The universe will be forever secure from the curse of sin ever rising again because everyone will know, from experience, that God is love. The rebellion brought out the love of Jesus and the Father like nothing else could, and it was their love that conquered it.
