            <h2>How much of the Bible is inspired by God? For what purpose?</h2>
            <p>
              <em>All</em> Scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable <em>for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness</em>, that the man of God may be perfect, throughly furnished unto all good works. <cite><b>2 Timothy 3:16, 17</b></cite>
            </p>

            <div>2</div>
            <h2>How did it maintain its miraculous unity?</h2>
            <p>
              Knowing this first, that no prophecy of the scripture is of any private interpretation. For the prophecy came not in old time by the will of man: but holy men of God spake <em>as they were moved by the Holy Ghost</em>. <cite><b>2 Peter 1:20, 21</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> The Bible was written over a period of 1,500 years by about 40 different authors whose education and background varied greatly. The Bible’s unity under these circumstances is astonishing and can only be explained by divine inspiration.

            <p>
              <em>Thy word is true from the beginning</em>, and every one of thy righteous judgments endureth for ever. <cite><b>Psalm 119:160</b></cite>

            <h2>But hasn’t it been corrupted over the ages?</h2>
            <p>

              The words of the LORD are <em>pure words</em>, as silver tried in a furnace of earth, purified seven times. Thou shalt keep them, O LORD, thou shalt <em>preserve them</em> from this generation for ever. <cite><b>Psalm 12:6, 7</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> God’s word is truth, and He will ensure it stays that way.

            <h2>Can God’s Word be changed or done away with?</h2>
            <p>
              Heaven and earth shall pass away, but <em>my words shall not pass away</em>. <cite><b>Matthew 24:35</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              For all flesh is as grass, and all the glory of man as the flower of grass. The grass withereth, and the flower thereof falleth away: but <em>the word of the LORD endureth for ever</em>. And this is the word which by the gospel is preached unto you. <cite><b>1 Peter 1:24, 25</b></cite>

            <h2>Why did God give us the Scriptures?</h2>
            <p>
              For whatsoever things were written aforetime were written <em>for our learning</em>, that we through patience and comfort of the scriptures <em>might have hope</em>. <cite><b>Romans 15:4</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              For this is good and acceptable in the sight of God our Savior, <em>who will have all men to be saved, and to come unto the knowledge of the truth</em>. <cite><b>1 Timothy 2:3, 4</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              And that from a child thou hast known the holy scriptures, which are able <em>to make thee wise unto salvation</em> through faith which is in Christ Jesus. <cite><b>2 Timothy 3:15</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> God gave us the Scriptures so we can learn about His character and be grounded in His truth while navigating a world of deception, so that through it we might be saved from sin and have hope of eternal life.

            <h2>Who do the Scriptures point me to?</h2>
            <p>
              Search the scriptures; for in them ye think ye have eternal life: and they are they which <em>testify of me</em>. <cite><b>John 5:39</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              Looking unto Jesus the <em>author and finisher of our faith</em>; who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross, despising the shame, and is set down at the right hand of the throne of God. <cite><b>Hebrews 12:2</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              Jesus saith unto him, <em>I am the way, the truth, and the life</em>: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me. <cite><b>John 14:6</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> All the stories of the Bible point me to Jesus, the Author and Finisher of my faith.

            <h2>How can I be blessed by the Bible?</h2>
            <p>
              <em>Study</em> to shew thyself approved unto God, a workman that needeth not to be ashamed, rightly dividing the word of truth. <cite><b>2 Timothy 2:15</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              These were more noble than those in Thessalonica, in that they received the word with all readiness of mind, and <em>searched the scriptures daily</em>, whether those things were so. <cite><b>Acts 17:11</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> The Bible is unlike any other book because it is my Creator and Redeemer’s special gift to me. He speaks to me through it, and it is my privilege to read it daily because by doing so I’ll draw closer to Him. Every relationship is built on spending quality time together, and my relationship with Jesus is no different.

            <h2>Is God’s Word as important as physical food?</h2>
            <p>
              But he answered and said, It is written, Man shall not live by bread alone, but by <em>every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God</em>. <cite><b>Matthew 4:4</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              Neither have I gone back from the commandment of his lips; I have esteemed the words of his mouth <em>more than my necessary food</em>. <cite><b>Job 23:12</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that believeth on me hath everlasting life. <em>I am that bread of life</em>. Your fathers did eat manna in the wilderness, and are dead. This is the bread which cometh down from heaven, that a man may eat thereof, and not die. I am the living bread which came down from heaven: <em>if any man eat of this bread, he shall live for ever</em>: and the bread that I will give is my flesh, which I will give for the life of the world. <cite><b>John 6:47-51</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> Jesus is the spiritual bread that brings everlasting life, and we “eat” it whenever we read His Word. Our need for Him is actually greater than our need for physical food.

            <h2>Who did Jesus say will help me understand the Bible?</h2>
            <p>
              Howbeit when he, <em>the Spirit of truth</em>, is come, he <em>will guide you into all truth</em>: for he shall not speak of himself; but whatsoever he shall hear, that shall he speak: and he will shew you things to come. <cite><b>John 16:13</b></cite>

            <div>11</div>
            <h2>Why should I ask for the Holy Spirit’s guidance?</h2>
            <p>
              Which things also we speak, not in the words which man's wisdom teacheth, but which the Holy Ghost teacheth; comparing spiritual things with spiritual. But the natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God: for they are foolishness unto him: neither can he know them, <em>because they are spiritually discerned</em>. <cite><b>1 Corinthians 2:13, 14</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> Because spiritual things are spiritually discerned and because the Bible is full of stories with symbolism that goes multiple levels deep, I need the Holy Spirit to open my spiritual eyes and help me bring these stories to life. Humility and a teachable attitude is also a crucial part of it.

            <h2>How should I study the Bible?</h2>
            <p>
              Whom shall he teach knowledge? and whom shall he make to understand doctrine? them that are weaned from the milk, and drawn from the breasts. For precept must be upon precept, <em>precept upon precept; line upon line</em>, line upon line; <em>here a little, and there a little</em>. <cite><b>Isaiah 28:9, 10</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> God is not a God of contradiction or confusion, so it’s important to not take verses out of context and build a doctrine based on a verse or two. When studying a particular topic, it’s critical to identify as many verses as possible dealing with the topic and to let the Bible clarify itself on what seem, due to our misunderstanding, like contradictory ones.
            </p>

          <section>

            <h2>What will the truth in God’s Word do to me?</h2>
            <p>
              <em>Sanctify them</em> through thy truth: thy word is truth. <cite><b>John 17:17</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              But we all, with open face <em>beholding as in a glass the glory of the LORD, are changed into the same image</em> from glory to glory, even as by the Spirit of the LORD. <cite><b>2 Corinthians 3:18</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              For <em>the word of God is living and powerful</em>, and sharper than any two-edged sword, piercing even to the division of soul and spirit, and of joints and marrow, and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart. <cite><b>Hebrews 4:12, NKJV</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> Reading the Bible brings me into contact with God’s divine mind and holy character, and by beholding it daily, I become more like Him through the work of the Holy Spirit. There is a reason the book of Hebrews calls the word of God living and powerful!

              If anyone wills to do His will, <em>he shall know concerning the doctrine</em>, whether it is from God or whether I speak on My own authority. <cite><b>John 7:17, NKJV</b></cite>

            <p class="note">

            </p>
            <p>
              I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the ending, saith the LORD, <em>which is, and which was, and which is to come</em>, the Almighty. <cite><b>Revelation 1:8</b></cite>

              Remember the former things of old: for I am God, and there is none else; I am God, and there is none like me, <em>declaring the end from the beginning</em>, and from ancient times the things that are not yet done, saying, My counsel shall stand, and I will do all my pleasure. <cite><b>Isaiah 46:9, 10</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              My frame was not hidden from You, when I was made in secret, and skillfully wrought in the lowest parts of the earth. Your eyes saw my substance, being yet unformed. And <em>in Your book they all were written, the days fashioned for me, when as yet there were none of them</em>. <cite><b>Psalm 139:15, 16, NKJV</b></cite>
            </p>

But when the blade was sprung up, and brought forth fruit, then appeared the tares also. So the servants of the householder came and said unto him, Sir, didst not thou sow good seed in thy field? from whence then hath it tares? He said unto them, <em>An enemy hath done this</em>. <cite><b>Matthew 13:24-28</b></cite>

            <p>
              Thou sealest up the sum, full of wisdom, and perfect in beauty. Thou hast been in Eden the garden of God; every precious stone was thy covering, the sardius, topaz, and the diamond, the beryl, the onyx, and the jasper, the sapphire, the emerald, and the carbuncle, and gold: the workmanship of thy tabrets and of thy pipes was prepared in thee in the day that thou wast created. <em>Thou art the anointed cherub that covereth</em>; and I have set thee so: thou wast upon the holy mountain of God; thou hast walked up and down in the midst of the stones of fire. <em>Thou wast perfect in thy ways from the day that thou wast created, till iniquity was found in thee</em>. <cite><b>Ezekiel 28:12-15</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              The Lord reigneth; let the people tremble: <em>he sitteth between the cherubims</em>; let the earth be moved. <cite><b>Psalm 99:1</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> In Ezekiel 28 Lucifer is symbolized as the “prince of Tyre,” and we learn that he was created perfect. He was also a covering cherub, which means he had a high position in heaven and was next to God’s very presence. It’s unknown how long perfection existed in heaven, but eventually evil was born in Lucifer’s heart because he aall of God’s angels had freedom of choice. This is a risk God willingly took because genuine love cannot exist without a free will.

            </p>
            <p>
              How art thou fallen from heaven, O Lucifer, son of the morning! how art thou cut down to the ground, which didst weaken the nations! For thou hast said in thine heart, I will ascend into heaven, <em>I will exalt my throne above the stars of God</em>: I will sit also upon the mount of the congregation, in the sides of the north: I will ascend above the heights of the clouds; <em>I will be like the most High</em>. <cite><b>Isaiah 14:12-14</b></cite>

              <b>Note:</b> Lucifer was able to convince other angels to join him in his rebellion, leading to war in heaven.

Would it bring more prosperity and happiness than God’s form of government?

            <p>
              So <em>God created man in his own image</em>, in the image of God created he him; male and female created he them. And God blessed them, and God said unto them, <em>Be fruitful, and multiply</em>, and replenish the earth, and subdue it: and have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth.
              <br><br>
              And God said, Behold, I have given you every herb bearing seed, which is upon the face of all the earth, and every tree, in the which is the fruit of a tree yielding seed; to you it shall be for meat. And to every beast of the earth, and to every fowl of the air, and to every thing that creepeth upon the earth, wherein there is life, I have given every green herb for meat: and it was so. And God saw every thing that he had made, and, behold, <em>it was very good</em>. And the evening and the morning were the sixth day. <cite><b>Genesis 1:27-31</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              And the LORD God took the man, and put him into the garden of Eden to dress it and to keep it. And the LORD God commanded the man, saying, Of every tree of the garden thou mayest freely eat: But <em>of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not eat of it</em>: for in the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die. <cite><b>Genesis 2:15-17</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> After losing some of His angels, God created a new order of beings after His own image. Adam and Eve were to be independent judges between the government of God and that of Satan since they did not witness the conflict in heaven. God gave them a perfect start, everything they needed for happiness and prosperity, but like His angels, they also had free will, and in order to be fair to Satan, God gave him access to them at the tree.

            <h2>What lie did Satan tell Eve that was an echo of Isaiah 14:14?</h2>
            <p>
              Now the serpent was more subtil than any beast of the field which the LORD God had made. And he said unto the woman, Yea, hath God said, Ye shall not eat of every tree of the garden? And the woman said unto the serpent, We may eat of the fruit of the trees of the garden: But of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden, God hath said, Ye shall not eat of it, neither shall ye touch it, lest ye die. And the serpent said unto the woman, Ye shall not surely die: For God doth know that in the day ye eat thereof, then <em>your eyes shall be opened, and ye shall be as gods, knowing good and evil</em>. <cite><b>Genesis 3:1-5</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> Satan used a serpent to deceive Eve and contradict God by telling her that not only would she not die if she ate the fruit, but she would also become like God, which is exactly what Satan himself desired in heaven. The implication was that God was holding her back from reaching her fullest potential, and Satan was actually the one who had her best interests in mind, not God.

            <p>
              And when the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that it was pleasant to the eyes, and a tree to be desired to make one wise, she took of the fruit thereof, and did eat, and gave also unto her husband with her; and he did eat. And <em>the eyes of them both were opened, and they knew that they were naked</em>; and they sewed fig leaves together, and made themselves aprons. <cite><b>Genesis 3:6-7</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> In order to deceive Eve, Satan mixed in some truth with his lie when he said she would know good and evil because now that they had sinned against God, Adam and Eve lost their innocence, and their eyes were indeed opened to shame, grief, suffering, pain, and death, but they did not ascend to a higher state of existence, as Satan had promised. It was not God’s will for them to know evil, but because Adam and Eve had chosen to believe Satan’s version of reality, he was now free to proceed with establishing his form of government on Earth.

            <h2>How can I go from death to justification of life?</h2>
            <p>
              For if by one man's offence death reigned by one; much more <em>they which receive abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness shall reign in life by one, Jesus Christ</em>. Therefore as by the offence of one judgment came upon all men to condemnation; even so by the righteousness of one the <em>free gift came upon all men unto justification of life</em>. For as by one man's disobedience many were made sinners, so <em>by the obedience of one shall many be made righteous</em>. <cite><b>Romans 5:17-19</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              Being justified freely by his grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus: Whom God hath set forth to be a propitiation through faith in his blood, <em>to declare his righteousness for the remission of sins</em> that are past, through the forbearance of God. <cite><b>Romans 3:24, 25</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> Christ’s perfect life gives us the ability to be free from the bondage of sin and it’s penalty of death! By paying for our sins, Jesus made it possible for anyone who receives this free gift by faith through repentance of sins to be forgiven and declared righteous before God!

            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> God in His love and mercy does not leave us in our hopeless condition. He gave His own Son to give us a way out of our predicament and eliminate the separation that occured between Him and the human race in the Garden of Eden.

            <p>
              Thine heart was lifted up because of thy beauty, thou hast corrupted thy wisdom by reason of thy brightness: I will cast thee to the ground, I will lay thee before kings, that they may behold thee.

            <p>
              And I saw <em>a new heaven and a new earth</em>: for the first heaven and the first earth were passed away; and there was no more sea. And I John saw the holy city, new Jerusalem, coming down from God out of heaven, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband. And I heard a great voice out of heaven saying, Behold, the tabernacle of God is with men, and he will dwell with them, and they shall be his people, and <em>God himself shall be with them, and be their God</em>. And God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes; and there shall be <em>no more death, neither sorrow, nor crying, neither shall there be any more pain: for the former things are passed away</em>. And he that sat upon the throne said, Behold, I make all things new. And he said unto me, Write: for these words are true and faithful. <cite><b>Revelation 21:1-5</b></cite>

              Then Judas, which had betrayed him, when he saw that he was condemned, repented himself, and brought again the <em>thirty pieces of silver</em> to the chief priests and elders, Saying, I have sinned in that I have betrayed the innocent blood. And they said, What is that to us? see thou to that. And <em>he cast down the pieces of silver in the temple</em>, and departed, and went and hanged himself. And the chief priests took the silver pieces, and said, It is not lawful for to put them into the treasury, because it is the price of blood. And they took counsel, and <em>bought with them the potter’s field</em>, to bury strangers in. <cite><b>Matthew 27:3-7</b></cite>

And God said, Behold, I have given you every herb bearing seed, which is upon the face of all the earth, and every tree, in the which is the fruit of a tree yielding seed; to you it shall be for meat. And to every beast of the earth, and to every fowl of the air, and to every thing that creepeth upon the earth, wherein there is life, I have given every green herb for meat: and it was so.

              Let the wicked <em>forsake his way</em>, and the unrighteous man his thoughts: and let him return unto the LORD, and he will have mercy upon him; and to our God, for he will abundantly pardon. <cite><b>Isaiah 55:7</b></cite>

              When Jesus had lifted up himself, and saw none but the woman, he said unto her, Woman, where are those thine accusers? hath no man condemned thee? She said, No man, Lord.

            <p>
              What shall we then say to these things? <em>If God be for us, who can be against us</em>? He that spared not His own Son, but delivered Him up for us all, <em>how shall He not with Him also freely give us all things</em>? <cite><b>Romans 8:31, 32</b></cite>

              Then the <em>king commanded to call the magicians, and the astrologers, and the sorcerers, and the Chaldeans, for to shew the king his dreams</em>. So they came and stood before the king. And the king said unto them, I have dreamed a dream, and my spirit was troubled to know the dream. Then spake the Chaldeans to the king in Syriack, O king, live for ever: tell thy servants the dream, and we will shew the interpretation.
              <br><br>
              The king answered and said to the Chaldeans, The thing is gone from me: if ye will not make known unto me the dream, with the interpretation thereof, ye shall be cut in pieces, and your houses shall be made a dunghill. But if ye shew the dream, and the interpretation thereof, ye shall receive of me gifts and rewards and great honour: therefore shew me the dream, and the interpretation thereof. They answered again and said, Let the king tell his servants the dream, and we will shew the interpretation of it.
              <br><br>
              The king answered and said, I know of certainty that ye would gain the time, because ye see the thing is gone from me. But if ye will not make known unto me the dream, there is but one decree for you: for ye have prepared lying and corrupt words to speak before me, till the time be changed: therefore tell me the dream, and I shall know that ye can shew me the interpretation thereof.
              <br><br>
              The Chaldeans answered before the king, and said, There is not a man upon the earth that can shew the king's matter: therefore there is no king, lord, nor ruler, that asked such things at any magician, or astrologer, or Chaldean. And <em>it is a rare thing that the king requireth, and there is none other that can shew it before the king, except the gods</em>, whose dwelling is not with flesh.

            <h2>How is the fourth kingdom described?</h2>
            <p>
              And the fourth kingdom shall be <em>strong as iron</em>: forasmuch as iron breaketh in pieces and subdueth all things: and as iron that breaketh all these, shall it break in pieces and bruise. <cite><b>Daniel 2:40</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
               <b>Note:</b> The iron monarchy of Rome conquered the Greeks in 168 B.C. and was the world power when Jesus was born. The legs of iron are a fitting symbol as its long reign of over 600 years resulted in much persecution of God’s people.

            <h2>What kind of kingdom did the feet and toes represent?</h2>
            <p>
              And whereas thou sawest the feet and toes, part of potters' clay, and part of iron, the <em>kingdom shall be divided</em>; but there shall be in it of the strength of the iron, forasmuch as thou sawest the iron mixed with miry clay. And as the toes of the feet were part of iron, and part of clay, so the <em>kingdom shall be partly strong, and partly broken</em>. <cite><b>Daniel 2:41, 42</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> After the Roman empire crumled in A.D. 476, it was divided by barbarian tribes into numerous kingdoms symbolized by the toes on the image, seven of which exist today: the Ostrogoths (gone), Visigoths (Spain), Franks (France), Vandals (gone), Alemannians (Germany), Sueves (Portugal), Anglo-Saxons (England), Heruli (gone), and Lombards (Italy). The toes being partly of iron and partly of clay means some would be stronger than others.

            <h2>Would it ever unite into one?</h2>
            <p>
              And whereas thou sawest iron mixed with miry clay, they shall mingle themselves with the seed of men: but <em>they shall not cleave one to another</em>, even as iron is not mixed with clay. <cite><b>Daniel 2:43</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> Despite attempts by Charlemagne, Napoleon, Kaiser Wilhelm II, and Hitler to unite Europe, it will never be reunited again. Even the European Union cannot succeed because the Bible says they will not adhere to one another.

            <h2>What would come after it?</h2>
            <p>
              And in the days of these kings shall the God of heaven set up <em>a kingdom, which shall never be destroyed</em>: and the kingdom shall not be left to other people, but it shall break in pieces and consume all these kingdoms, and <em>it shall stand for ever</em>. Forasmuch as thou sawest that the stone was cut out of the mountain without hands, and that it brake in pieces the iron, the brass, the clay, the silver, and the gold; the great God hath made known to the king what shall come to pass hereafter: and the dream is certain, and the interpretation thereof sure. <cite><b>Daniel 2:44-45</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> The stone cut without hands represents the kingdom of heaven, which will replace all the earthly kingdoms at the coming of Christ, and His reign will have no end. Since the stone strikes the image’s feet, Jesus will come during the time of the divided nations.

And while they looked stedfastly toward heaven as he went up, behold, two men stood by them in white apparel; which also said, Ye men of Galilee, why stand ye gazing up into heaven? this same Jesus, which is taken up from you into heaven, <em>shall so come in like manner as ye have seen him go into heaven</em>. <cite><b>Acts 1:9-11</b></cite>

As therefore the tares are gathered and burned in the fire; so shall it be in the end of this world. The Son of man shall send forth his angels, and <em>they shall gather out of his kingdom all things that offend, and them which do iniquity</em>; and shall cast them into a furnace of fire: there shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth.

            <p>
              And I saw heaven opened, and behold a white horse; and he that sat upon him was called Faithful and True, and in righteousness he doth judge and make war. His eyes were as a flame of fire, and <em>on his head were many crowns</em>; and he had a name written, that no man knew, but he himself. And he was clothed with a vesture dipped in blood: and his name is called The Word of God. And <em>the armies which were in heaven followed him upon white horses</em>, clothed in fine linen, white and clean. And out of his mouth goeth a sharp sword, that with it he should smite the nations: and he shall rule them with a rod of iron: and he treadeth the winepress of the fierceness and wrath of Almighty God. And he hath on his vesture and on his thigh a name written, <em>KING OF KINGS, AND LORD OF LORDS</em>. <cite><b>Revelation 19:11-16</b></cite>
            </p>

            <h2>What is the first sign Jesus mentions?</h2>
            <p>
              And as he sat upon the mount of Olives, the disciples came unto him privately, saying, Tell us, when shall these things be? and what shall be the sign of thy coming, and of the end of the world? And Jesus answered and said unto them, <em>Take heed that no man deceive you. For many shall come in my name, saying, I am Christ; and shall deceive many</em>. <cite><b>Matthew 24:3-5</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              For there <em>shall arise false Christs, and false prophets, and shall shew great signs and wonders</em>; insomuch that, if it were possible, they shall deceive the very elect. <cite><b>Matthew 24:24</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              For such are false apostles, deceitful workers, transforming themselves into the apostles of Christ. And no marvel; for <em>Satan himself is transformed into an angel of light</em>. <cite><b>2 Corinthians 11:13, 14</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> Jesus is emphasizing that deception will not only be prevelant in the lead-up to His coming, but it will also be powerful because it will be accompanied by signs and wonders. And it’s not just people who can pretend to be something they’re not, but Satan himself can appear as an angel of light.

For nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom: and <em>there shall be famines, and pestilences, and earthquakes, in divers places</em>. <cite><b>Matthew 24:6, 7</b></cite>

            <p>
              But <em>as the days of Noe were, so shall also the coming of the Son of man be</em>. For as in the days that were before the flood they were eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, until the day that Noe entered into the ark, and knew not until the flood came, and took them all away; so shall also the coming of the Son of man be. <cite><b>Matthew 24:37-39</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> There’s nothing wrong with marriage as it was instituted and blessed by God, and it’s impossible to survive without nourishing our bodies. The point is in Noah’s days most people ignored him. Life is busy, and it’s easy to get preoccupied with temporal things and neglect spiritual things. Where do our own priorities stand?

              Go to now, ye rich men, weep and howl for your miseries that shall come upon you. <em>Your riches are corrupted</em>, and your garments are motheaten. Your gold and silver is cankered; and the rust of them shall be a witness against you, and shall eat your flesh as it were fire. Ye have heaped treasure together for the last days. Behold, the <em>hire of the labourers who have reaped down your fields, which is of you kept back by fraud, crieth</em>: and the cries of them which have reaped are entered into the ears of the Lord of sabaoth. Ye have lived in pleasure on the earth, and been wanton; ye have nourished your hearts, as in a day of slaughter. <cite><b>James 5:1-5</b></cite>

            <p>
              <em>Watch therefore</em>: for ye know not what hour your Lord doth come. But know this, that if the goodman of the house had known in what watch the thief would come, he would have watched, and would not have suffered his house to be broken up. Therefore <em>be ye also ready</em>: for in such an hour as ye think not the Son of man cometh. <cite><b>Matthew 24:42-44</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>

            <p>
              I will say of the LORD, <em>He is my refuge and my fortress: my God; in him will I trust</em>. Surely <em>he shall deliver thee</em> from the snare of the fowler, and from the noisome pestilence.

            <h2>Has the judgment already begun?</h2>
            <p>
              And I saw another angel fly in the midst of heaven, having the everlasting gospel to preach unto them that dwell on the earth, and to every nation, and kindred, and tongue, and people, saying with a loud voice, Fear God, and give glory to him; <em>for the hour of his judgment is come</em>: and worship him that made heaven, and earth, and the sea, and the fountains of waters. <cite><b>Revelation 14:6,7</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              And, behold, I come quickly; and my reward is with me, <em>to give every man according as his work shall be</em>. <cite><b>Revelation 22:12</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> In Revelation 14 there are three angels proclaiming a message to the people of the world in the last days, and the first angel’s message is that the judgment has begun. So the judgment begins in the last days, which we are living in. When Jesus comes back to Earth He’s bringing a reward with Him, which means the judgment has already taken place to decide who will be saved.

            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> Every person who has ever lived on planet Earth will be judged. Furthermore, each person will be responsible for his or her own actions; it will not be possible to hide behind another person’s decisions, actions, or ultimatums.

              I beheld till the thrones were cast down, and <em>the Ancient of Days did sit</em>, whose garment was white as snow, and the hair of his head like the pure wool: his throne was like the fiery flame, and his wheels as burning fire. A fiery stream issued and came forth from before him: thousand thousands ministered unto him, and ten thousand times ten thousand stood before him: the <em>judgment was set, and the books were opened</em>. <cite><b>Daniel 7:9, 10</b></cite>
            </p>

              My little children, these things write I unto you, that ye sin not. And if any man sin, <em>we have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous</em>. <cite><b>1 John 2:1</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              And the great dragon was cast out, that old serpent, called <em>the Devil, and Satan</em>, which deceiveth the whole world: he was cast out into the earth ... for <em>the accuser of our brethren</em> is cast down, which accused them before our God day and night. <cite><b>Revelation 12:9, 10</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> God the Father, the Ancient of Days, presides over the judgment, while Jesus is the Judge, as well as our Advocate! Satan is our only accusser, declaring that we don’t deserve to be saved any more than he does.

            <p>
              Let us hear the conclusion of the whole matter: Fear God, and keep his commandments: for this is the whole duty of man. For <em>God shall bring every work into judgment, with every secret thing</em>, whether it be good, or whether it be evil. <cite><b>Ecclesiastes 12:13, 14</b></cite>

            <h2>Does God keep a record of evidence for the judgment?</h2>
            <p>
              And I saw the dead, small and great, stand before God; and the books were opened: and another book was opened, which is the book of life: and <em>the dead were judged out of those things which were written in the books, according to their works</em>. <cite><b>Revelation 20:12</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              And there shall in no wise enter into it any thing that defileth, neither whatsoever worketh abomination, or maketh a lie: <em>but they which are written in the Lamb's book of life</em>. <cite><b>Revelation 21:27</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              For though thou wash thee with nitre, and take thee much soap, yet <em>thine iniquity is marked before me</em>, saith the Lord GOD. <cite><b>Jeremiah 2:22</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              Then those who feared the Lord spoke to one another, and the Lord listened attentively and heard it, and a <em>book of remembrance was written before Him for those who fear the Lord and esteem His name</em>. <cite><b>Malachi 3:16, NASB</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> Evidence for the judgment comes from books containing every detail of a person’s life, including every sin. There is also a Book of Remembrance containing every kind word, unselfish act, or sacrifice made by those who follow Jesus as evidence of God’s transforming power in their lives. These people’s names are also written in the Book of Life.

            <h2>What is God’s standard in the judgment?</h2>
            <p>
              If ye fulfil the royal law according to the scripture, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself, ye do well: But if ye have respect to persons, ye commit sin, and are <em>convinced of the law as transgressors</em>. For whosoever shall keep the whole law, and yet offend in one point, he is guilty of all. For he that said, Do not commit adultery, said also, Do not kill. Now if thou commit no adultery, yet if thou kill, thou art become a transgressor of the law. So speak ye, and so do, as they that <em>shall be judged by the law of liberty</em>. <cite><b>James 2:10-12</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              Whosoever committeth sin transgresseth also the law: for <em>sin is the transgression of the law</em>. <cite><b>1 John 3:4</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> If God keeps a record of our sins, and sin is the transgression of the law, then the Ten Commandment law is God’s standard by which we will be judged.

            </p>
            <p>
              Wherefore, as by one man sin entered into the world, and death by sin; and so <em>death passed upon all men</em>, for that all have sinned. <cite><b>Romans 5:12</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> Because all have sinned, everyone is under condemnation before the law. If nothing is done to remedy the situation, by default, every person sits on "death row" and simply waits for the judgment.

            <p>
              Seek ye the LORD while he may be found, call ye upon him while he is near: <em>Let the wicked forsake his way, and the unrighteous man his thoughts</em>: and let him return unto the LORD, and he will have mercy upon him; and to our God, for <em>he will abundantly pardon</em>. <cite><b>Isaiah 55:6-7</b></cite>

            </p>
            <p>
              For we have not an high priest which cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities; but was <em>in all points tempted like as we are, yet without sin</em>. Let us therefore come boldly unto the throne of grace, that we may obtain mercy, and find grace to help in time of need. <cite><b>Hebrews 4:15-16</b></cite>

              Nevertheless I tell you the truth; It is expedient for you that I go away: for if I go not away, the Comforter will not come unto you; but if I depart, I will send him unto you. And when he is come, <em>he will reprove the world of sin</em>, and of righteousness, and of judgment. <cite><b>John 16:7, 8</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              But the Comforter, which is the Holy Ghost, whom the Father will send in my name, he shall teach you all things, and <em>bring all things to your remembrance</em>, whatsoever I have said unto you. <cite><b>John 14:26</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> The Holy Spirit plays a crucial role as well by convicting us of sin and bringing to remembrance sins we have not confessed yet so there isn’t a single unconfessed sin left in our heavenly record for Satan to point to as a witness against us in the judgment.

            <p>
              There is therefore now <em>no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus</em>, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit. For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus hath made me free from the law of sin and death. For what the law could not do, in that it was weak through the flesh, God sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh, and for sin, condemned sin in the flesh: <em>that the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit</em>. <cite><b>Romans 8:1-4</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              He that overcometh, the same shall be <em>clothed in white raiment</em>; and I will <em>not blot out his name out of the book of life</em>, but I will confess his name before my Father, and before his angels. <cite><b>Revelation 3:5</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              Notwithstanding in this rejoice not, that the spirits are subject unto you; but rather <em>rejoice, because your names are written in heaven</em>. <cite><b>Luke 10:20</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> Those whose record of sin has been blotted out are no longer under condemnation because they have been forgiven through Christ, who paid the penalty for their sin on the cross and who stands before the law on their behalf with His perfect character. The law can now be fulfilled in them through the abiding presence and enabling power of the Spirit, and their names will not be blotted out from the Book of Life!

            </p>
            <p>

            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> When the Holy Spirit convicts it is not wise to ignore it or put it off to a more convenient time because that time may never come. Tomorrow is not guaranteed; we only have today. Today is the day to get right with God.

            <p>
              The works of his hands are verity and judgment; all his commandments are sure. <em>They stand fast for ever and ever</em>, and are <em>done in truth and uprightness</em>. <cite><b>Psalm 111:7, 8</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              The law of the LORD is <em>perfect</em>, converting the soul: the testimony of the LORD is <em>sure</em>, making wise the simple. The statutes of the LORD are <em>right</em>, rejoicing the heart: the commandment of the LORD is <em>pure</em>, enlightening the eyes. <cite><b>Psalm 19:7, 8</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> Every government has laws to ensure order and protection for its citizens. It is no different with the King of the universe and His government, except His law is eternal, true, upright, perfect, sure, right, and pure. God’s dominion knows no bounds, and His law, therefore, is universal as well, so even though it’s mostly neglected on Earth, it is still binding.

More to be desired are they than gold, yea, than much fine gold: sweeter also than honey and the honeycomb.

              <b>Note:</b> Satan rebelled against God’s law in heaven because he didn’t want to be restricted by it, and when Adam and Even believed his lie about defining good and evil for themselves (Genesis 3:5), his lawless kingdom took over Earth as well. Our Creator God defines good and evil for us in His law because He knows what’s best for us better than we will ever know ourselves. And His law is not a restriction; it’s there to be a blessing, to protect us from evils, such as murder, adultery, theft, and falsehood, ensuring a happy and harmonious existence for all.

            <p>
              If ye fulfil the royal law according to the scripture, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself, ye do well: But if ye have respect to persons, ye commit sin, and are convinced of the law as transgressors. <em>For whosoever shall keep the whole law, and yet offend in one point, he is guilty of all</em>. For he that said, Do not commit adultery, said also, Do not kill. Now if thou commit no adultery, yet if thou kill, <em>thou art become a transgressor of the law</em>. So speak ye, and so do, as they that shall be judged by the law of liberty. <cite><b>James 2:8-12</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              For as many as are of the works of the law are under the curse: for it is written, <em>Cursed is every one that continueth not in all things which are written in the book of the law to do them</em>. <cite><b>Galatians 3:10</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              But we are all as an unclean thing, and <em>all our righteousnesses are as filthy rags</em>; and we all do fade as a leaf; and our iniquities, like the wind, have taken us away. <cite><b>Isaiah 64:6</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> When James is talking about the law, he is referring to the Ten Commandments, and he actually says it’s not enough to keep some or even most of them. Breaking even one is breaking them all. Consequently, there is no human being who hasn’t been condemned by the law, which is the standard during the judgment (see “Judgment”).

            <p>
              But that no man is justified by the law in the sight of God, it is evident: for, <em>The just shall live by faith</em>.  <cite><b>Galatians 3:11</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              For sin shall not have dominion over you: for <em>ye are not under the law, but under grace</em>. <cite><b>Romans 6:14</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              Being justified freely by his grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus: whom God hath set forth to be a propitiation through faith in his blood, to declare his righteousness for the remission of sins that are past, through the forbearance of God; to declare, I say, at this time his righteousness: that he might be just, and the justifier of him which believeth in Jesus. Where is boasting then? It is excluded. By what law? of works? Nay: but by the law of faith. Therefore we conclude that a <em>man is justified by faith without the deeds of the law</em>. <cite><b>Romans 3:24-28</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> Because Jesus is the Creator God, He was able to take the condemnation of the law on Himself at the cross, on behalf of all humanity, so that every person who accepts Him by faith in His substitutionary sacrifice could stand before the law clothed in His perfectly righteous life!

            <p>
              Therefore we conclude that a man is justified by faith without the deeds of the law. Is he the God of the Jews only? Is he not also of the Gentiles? Yes, of the Gentiles also: seeing it is one God, which shall justify the circumcision by faith, and uncircumcision through faith. <em>Do we then make void the law through faith? God forbid: yea, we establish the law</em>. <cite><b>Romans 3:28-31</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              What then? shall we sin, because we are not under the law, but under grace? <em>God forbid</em>. <cite><b>Romans 6:15</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              Think not that I am come to destroy the law, or the prophets: <em>I am not come to destroy, but to fulfil</em>. For verily I say unto you, Till heaven and earth pass, one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law, till all be fulfilled. <cite><b>Matthew 5:17, 18</b></cite>

            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> If you were caught speeding and the police officer wanted to give you a hefty fine, but decided to give you a warning instead, would you then go screeching out back on the highway to break the speed limit again? No, you would carefully watch your speed. Jesus’ death on the cross was an act of mercy and forgiveness for those who accept it, not a license to live lawlessly.

            <h2>What does sin do?</h2>
            <p>
              Behold, the LORD'S hand is not shortened, that it cannot save; neither his ear heavy, that it cannot hear: But <em>your iniquities have separated between you and your God</em>, and your sins have hid his face from you, that he will not hear. <cite><b>Isaiah 59:1, 2</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              <em>For the wages of sin is death</em>; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord. <cite><b>Romans 6:23</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> Sin cannot exist in the presence of a holy God because at the root of sin is selfishness, which is abhorent to God’s character of love. As a result, sin creates separation between me and God, the Giver of life, and leads to eternal death if left untreated.

            <h2>What is the motivation for keeping His law?</h2>
            <p>
              <em>If ye love me</em>, keep my commandments. <cite><b>John 14:15</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              For <em>this is the love of God, that we keep his commandments</em>: and his commandments are not grievous. <cite><b>1 John 5:3</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              Then one of them, which was a lawyer, asked him a question, tempting him, and saying, Master, which is the great commandment in the law? Jesus said unto him, <em>Thou shalt love the Lord thy God</em> with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind. This is the first and great commandment. And the second is like unto it, <em>Thou shalt love thy neighbour</em> as thyself. <em>On these two commandments hang all the law</em> and the prophets. <cite><b>Matthew 22:35-40</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              Love worketh no ill to his neighbour: therefore <em>love is the fulfilling of the law</em>. <cite><b>Romans 13:10</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> Since selfishness is at the root of sin, and sin is the breaking of His law, then the law is really a law of love, dealing with my relationship with God (the first four commandments) and my neighbor (the last six). That’s why Jesus said that the entire law hangs on loving God and loving my neighbor. When there is genuine love present in a relationship then pleasing that person ceases to become a burden; in fact, without love for Jesus it’s not possible to keep His law.

            <h2>What is one of the purposes of the law?</h2>
            <p>
              He who says, “I know Him,” and does not keep His commandments, is a liar, and the truth is not in him. But whoever keeps His word, truly the love of God is perfected in him. <em>By this we know that we are in Him</em>. <cite><b>1 John 2:4, 5, NKJV</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              Not every one that saith unto me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of heaven; but <em>he that doeth the will of my Father which is in heaven</em>. Many will say to me in that day, Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied in thy name? and in thy name have cast out devils? and in thy name done many wonderful works? And then will I profess unto them, <em>I never knew you: depart from me, ye that work iniquity</em>. <cite><b>Matthew 7:21-23</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              The <em>heart is deceitful above all things</em>, and desperately wicked: who can know it? <em>I the LORD search the heart</em>, I try the reins, even to give every man according to his ways, and according to the fruit of his doings. <cite><b>Jeremiah 17:9, 10</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              O LORD, <em>thou hast searched me, and known me</em>. Thou knowest my downsitting and mine uprising, thou understandest my thought afar off. Thou compassest my path and my lying down, and <em>art acquainted with all my ways</em>. For there is not a word in my tongue, but, lo, O LORD, thou knowest it altogether. <cite><b>Psalm 139:1-4</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> God knows me better than I know myself, and He knows if I truly love Him. The Ten Commandments are really a mirror for me that shows my genuine condition; they provide evidence letting me know if I truly love Him because it can be easy to deceive myself. Jesus says there will be people who served Him and thought they loved Him, but their lawlessness will say otherwise.

            <p>
              For this is the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel after those days, saith the Lord; <em>I will put my laws into their mind, and write them in their hearts</em>: and I will be to them a God, and they shall be to me a people. <cite><b>Hebrews 8:10</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              Then will I sprinkle clean water upon you, and ye shall be clean: from all your filthiness, and from all your idols, will I cleanse you. A new heart also will I give you, and a new spirit will I put within you: and I will take away the stony heart out of your flesh, and I will give you an heart of flesh. <em>And I will put my spirit within you, and cause you to walk in my statutes, and ye shall keep my judgments, and do them</em>. <cite><b>Ezekiel 36:25-27</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              Hitherto have ye asked nothing in my name: <em>ask, and ye shall receive, that your joy may be full</em>. <cite><b>John 16:34</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              I delight to do thy will, O my God: yea, <em>thy law is within my heart</em>. <cite><b>Psalm 40:8</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> God promises to help me keep His commandments because He knows that I cannot overcome sin myself. But He does not force Himself on anyone, so I must ask, and the promise is He will write His law in my heart and mind, enabling me to walk in His commandments through the power of the Holy Spirit dwelling in me! If I believe that He will keep this promise, He will do it according to my faith, and He will make it a delight to do His will because He will write the law in my heart! The only one who can create a new heart in me is the One who created the world in Eden.

            <h2>How does the devil feel about keeping God’s law?</h2>
            <p>
              And <em>the dragon was wroth with the woman</em>, and went to make war with the remnant of her seed, <em>which keep the commandments of God</em>, and have the testimony of Jesus Christ. <cite><b>Revelation 12:17</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              Jesus replied, “And <em>why do you break the command of God for the sake of your tradition</em>? ... Thus you nullify the word of God for the sake of your tradition. You hypocrites! Isaiah prophesied correctly about you: ‘These people honor Me with their lips, but their hearts are far from Me. <em>They worship Me in vain; they teach as doctrine the precepts of men</em>.’ <cite><b>Matthew 15:3, 6-9</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              It is time for thee, LORD, to work: <em>for they have made void thy law</em>. <cite><b>Psalm 119:126</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> The devil’s war against God and His law started in the courts of heaven and has been raging ever since here on Earth. Is it any surprise that the devil would try to persuade people that God's law is no longer binding and even go as far as persecuting those who keep it?

            <p>
              And I saw another angel fly in the midst of heaven, having the everlasting gospel to preach unto them that dwell on the earth, and to every nation, and kindred, and tongue, and people, saying with a loud voice, Fear God, and give glory to him; for the hour of his judgment is come: and <em>worship him that made heaven, and earth, and the sea, and the fountains of waters</em>. <cite><b>Revelation 14:6, 7</b></cite>

              <b>Note:</b> In Revelation 14 there are three angels proclaiming a message to the people of the world in the last days, and the first angel’s message is a call to worship the Creator God and give glory to Him.

            <p>
              For by him [Jesus] were all things created, that are in heaven, and that are in earth, visible and invisible, whether they be thrones, or dominions, or principalities, or powers: <em>all things were created by him, and for him</em>: and he is before all things, and <em>by him all things consist</em>. <cite><b>Colossians 1:16, 17</b></cite>

            <h2>Which commandment identifies the Creator God?</h2>
            <p>
              Remember the sabbath day, to keep it holy. Six days shalt thou labour, and do all thy work: but the seventh day is the sabbath of the LORD thy God: in it thou shalt not do any work, thou, nor thy son, nor thy daughter, thy manservant, nor thy maidservant, nor thy cattle, nor thy stranger that is within thy gates: <em>for in six days the LORD made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that in them is, and rested the seventh day</em>: wherefore the LORD blessed the sabbath day, and hallowed it. <cite><b>Exodus 20:8-11</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> The fourth commandment begins with the word “remember” because God knew His Sabbath would be forgotten. It also identifies God as the Creator of everything, and every created being is invited to show his or her acknowledgment of this by resting on the Sabbath day, just like He rested on the seventh day as an example for us.

            <h2>What else can I learn about the Sabbath from Genesis 2?</h2>
            <p>
              Thus the heavens and the earth were finished, and all the host of them. And on the seventh day God ended his work which he had made; and he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had made. And <em>God blessed the seventh day, and sanctified it</em>: because that in it he had rested from all his work which God created and made. <cite><b>Genesis 2:1-3</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> The reason why the fourth commandment invites me to keep the Sabbath day holy is because God blessed this specific day and sanctified it. The word used in the original text is “qadash,” which means “to be set apart or consecrated.” In other words, the seventh day is special to God and unlike any of the other six days of the week.

            <h2>Who is the Sabbath really for?</h2>
            <p>
              And he said unto them, <em>The sabbath was made for man</em>, and not man for the sabbath: therefore the Son of man is Lord also of the sabbath. <cite><b>Mark 2:27, 28</b></cite>

            <h2>Why was it given to us?</h2>
            <p>
              Moreover also I gave them my sabbaths, <em>to be a sign</em> between me and them, that they <em>might know that I am the LORD that sanctify them</em>. ... And hallow my sabbaths; and they shall be a sign between me and you, <em>that ye may know that I am the LORD your God</em>. <cite><b>Ezekiel 20:12, 20</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> The Sabbath is a sign of my acknowledgment that 1) God is Lord of the universe because He created it in six literal days (Exodus 20:8, 11) and 2) He is Lord of my life because He’s the One who redeems and sanctifies me. In Eden God rested on the seventh day from His word of creation, and in the tomb Jesus rested on the same day from His work of redemption. Thus the Sabbath is a memorial of these two things, a weekly rest in Jesus where despite having a plethora of things to do, I still put them aside to connect with and honor Him. The Sabbath is also a beautiful weekly reminder that I am saved by faith in His completed work on the cross, instead of my own works.

            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> The Bible is clear that His followers kept the Sabbath. In fact, they even stopped their work of anointing His body in order to keep it according to the commandment. They ended up coming back on Sunday, the first day of the week, after the Sabbath was over, to finish their work.

              <b>Note:</b> God is Lord of the Sabbath, which is Saturday, the seventh day (Exodus 8:11). Notice that He calls these days “My Sabbaths,” meaning it’s His special day that He blessed and sanctified to be a sign between Him and me of His creative, redeeming, and sanctifying power! The Sabbath is a day of rest from works, and as such, it is a beautiful symbol of righteousness by faith as we are saved by the righteousness of Jesus, not our works.

            <p>
              Wherefore the children of Israel shall keep the sabbath, to observe the sabbath throughout their generations, for a <em>perpetual covenant</em>. It is a sign between me and the children of Israel <em>for ever</em>: for in six days the LORD made heaven and earth, and on the seventh day he rested, and was refreshed. And he gave unto Moses, when he had made an end of communing with him upon mount Sinai, two tables of testimony, <em>tables of stone</em>, written with the finger of God. <cite><b>Exodus 31:16-18</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> The Ten Commandments, which the Sabbath is a part of, were written by the finger of God on tablets of stone, instead of a material subject to decay, like wood or clay, as a testament to their timelessness. This is in contrast to Jesus writing the sins of the woman caught in adultery in the dust (John 8:1-11), as a beautiful testament to God’s willingness to forgive anyone who repents.

              Thus the heavens and the earth were finished, and all the host of them. And on the seventh day God ended his work which he had made; and <em>he rested on the seventh day</em> from all his work which he had made. And <em>God blessed the seventh day, and sanctified it</em>: because that in it he had rested from all his work which God created and made. <cite><b>Genesis 2:1-3</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              For as the new heavens and the new earth, which I will make, shall remain before me, saith the LORD, so shall your seed and your name remain. And it shall come to pass, that from one new moon to another, and <em>from one sabbath to another, shall all flesh come to worship before me</em>, saith the LORD. <cite><b>Isaiah 66:22, 23</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> The seventh day Sabbath, known as Saturday today, was set apart, blessed, and sanctified on the very first week of creation, long before there was a Jewish nation, and it will be kept even in heaven.

            <h2>What does the Bible say about unbelief and the seventh day?</h2>
            <p>
              For he spake in a certain place of the seventh day on this wise, and God did rest the seventh day from all his works. And in this place again, If they shall enter into my rest. Seeing therefore it remaineth that some must enter therein, and <em>they to whom it was first preached entered not in because of unbelief</em> ... There remaineth therefore a rest to the people of God. For he that is entered into his rest, he also hath ceased from his own works, as God did from his. <em>Let us labour therefore to enter into that rest, lest any man fall after the same example of unbelief</em>. <cite><b>Hebrews 4:4-6, 9-11</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> The book of Hebrews says there was unbelief about resting on the seventh day, but to deny this day is to deny salvation by faith. Because I cannot sanctify or save myself, I am invited to cease from trying to be saved by my own works and rest in the righteous life of Jesus on my behalf. Resting on the seventh day of the week, as God did in Genesis 2, is an acknowledgment of this sublime truth.

              And that day was the preparation, and the sabbath drew on. And the women also, which came with him from Galilee, followed after, and beheld the sepulchre, and how his body was laid. And they returned, and prepared spices and ointments; and <em>rested the sabbath day according to the commandment</em>. <cite><b>Luke 23:54-56</b></cite>

            </p>
            <p>
              In the end of the sabbath, as it began to dawn toward the <em>first day of the week, came Mary Magdalene and the other Mary to see the sepulchre</em>. <cite><b>Matthew 28:1</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              And very early in the morning the <em>first day of the week, they came unto the sepulchre</em> at the rising of the sun. <cite><b>Mark 16:2</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              The <em>first day of the week cometh Mary Magdalene early, when it was yet dark, unto the sepulchre</em>, and seeth the stone taken away from the sepulchre. <cite><b>John 20:1</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              Now when Jesus was risen early the <em>first day of the week, he appeared first to Mary Magdalene</em>, out of whom he had cast seven devils. <cite><b>Mark 16:9</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> Jesus’ followers were so concerned about the Sabbath that they even stopped their labor of love in preparing His body for burial, kept the Sabbath, and returned to resume their unfinished work early Sunday morning. Notice there is no mention of them keeping the first day, Sunday, holy in honor of Jesus’ resurrection, nor is there a command by Jesus to do so. When He appeared to Mary Magdalene that morning there was no talk of Sunday keeping at all.

            <p>
              And upon the <em>first day of the week, when the disciples came together to break bread</em>, Paul preached unto them, ready to depart on the morrow; and continued his speech until midnight. <cite><b>Acts 20:7</b></cite>

            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> There is no significance to the breaking of bread in Acts 20:7 because in Acts 2:46 we learn that the early Christians broke break daily. Nothing in these passages indicates that they considered the first day holy. The meeting in Acts 20:7 was taking place because Paul was leaving the next day.

On the contrary, His mission was to fulfill the law, to uphold and expand it beyond the “letter” of the law to include the “spirit” of the law, as well. (For example, He expanded the sin of adultery to also include lust of the heart, see Matthew 5:28.)

And it waxed great, even to the host of heaven; and it cast down some of the host and of the stars to the ground, and stamped upon them. Yea, <em>he magnified himself even to the prince of the host</em>, and by him the daily sacrifice was taken away, and the place of his sanctuary was cast down. And an host was given him against the daily sacrifice by reason of transgression, and <em>it cast down the truth to the ground</em>; and it practised, and prospered. <cite><b>Daniel 8:9-12</b></cite>

There is only one commandment that is both a time and a law: the fourth one. The first seeds for its change were planted during Constantine’s conversion to Christianity in 312 A.D. when he passed a law declaring Sunday, which was the pagan day of the sun, as the day of rest across the Roman Empire. That seed took root in 363 A.D. when the Council of Laodicea urged Christians to keep Sunday as their rest day, while prohibiting them from resting on Saturday, the seventh day Sabbath, and the rest is history.

But in vain they do worship me, <em>teaching for doctrines the commandments of men</em>. <cite><b>Matthew 15:6-9</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> The elevation of human-made commandments and tradition above the truth of the Bible was already a problem in Jesus’ time, and He warned against such hypocrisy.

            <h2>What role will the law play in the last days?</h2>
            <p>
              And after these things I saw four angels standing on the four corners of the earth, holding the four winds of the earth, that the wind should not blow on the earth, nor on the sea, nor on any tree. And I saw another angel ascending from the east, having the seal of the living God: and he cried with a loud voice to the four angels, to whom it was given to hurt the earth and the sea, saying, Hurt not the earth, neither the sea, nor the trees, <em>till we have sealed the servants of our God in their foreheads</em>. <cite><b>Revelation 7:1-3</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              Bind up the testimony, <em>seal the law</em> among my disciples. <cite><b>Isaiah 8:16</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> In the last days there will be a sealing of God’s people in their foreheads, and Isaiah says it’s the law that’s sealed among His people. The sealing of the law in the forehead is God’s people making an unwavering decision in their mind to honor the authority of God’s law in their life as supreme and above the laws of men, no matter the cost.

            <h2>What is said about the saints?</h2>
            <p>
              Saying with a loud voice, Fear God, and give glory to him; for the hour of his judgment is come: and <em>worship him that made heaven, and earth, and the sea, and the fountains of waters</em>. ... Here is the patience of the saints: here are <em>they that keep the commandments of God, and the faith of Jesus</em>. <cite><b>Revelation 14:7, 12</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> There will be a call in the last days to worship God, the Creator of the universe, which implies there will be another power vying to be worshiped as well. This call is a reference to the last part of the fourth commandment where keeping the Sabbath is identified as a sign and an acknowledgment that God is the Creator of all. Could the worship of God by keeping Saturday, the seventh day Sabbath, constitute the seal of God in the last days? Verse 12 leaves no room for doubt when it says the saints will be keeping the faith of Jesus, who kept the seventh day Sabbath, and the commandments of God, which include the fourth. May we be found faithful in our stand for Jesus.

            <h2>What does Isaiah say about those who keep the Sabbath?</h2>
            <p>
              <em>Blessed is the man</em> that doeth this, and the son of man that layeth hold on it; that keepeth the sabbath from polluting it, and keepeth his hand from doing any evil. <cite><b>Isaiah 56:2</b></cite>

            <h2>Is this confirmed elsewhere?</h2>
            <p>
              For in six days the LORD made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that in them is, and rested the seventh day: wherefore <em>the LORD blessed the sabbath day</em>, and hallowed it. <cite><b>Exodus 20:11</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              And it shall come to pass, if thou shalt hearken diligently unto the voice of the LORD thy God, to observe and to do all his commandments which I command thee this day, that the LORD thy God will set thee on high above all nations of the earth: and <em>all these blessings shall come on thee, and overtake thee</em>, if thou shalt hearken unto the voice of the LORD thy God. ... But it shall come to pass, if thou wilt not hearken unto the voice of the LORD thy God, to observe to do all his commandments and his statutes which I command thee this day; that all these curses shall come upon thee, and overtake thee. <cite><b>Deuteronomy 28:1, 2, 15</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> The Sabbath was not made to be a burden, but a blessing to the human race, and those who keep it partake in the blessing on a weekly basis. In Deuteronomy 28 God also pronounces other blessings on those who keep His commandments, including the fourth.

            <h2>How is the Sabbath to be kept?</h2>
            <p>
              Remember the sabbath day, to keep it holy. Six days shalt thou labour, and do all thy work: but the seventh day is the sabbath of the LORD thy God: in it <em>thou shalt not do any work, thou, nor thy son, nor thy daughter, thy manservant, nor thy maidservant, nor thy cattle, nor thy stranger that is within thy gates</em>: for in six days the LORD made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that in them is, and rested the seventh day: wherefore the LORD blessed the sabbath day, and hallowed it. <cite><b>Exodus 20:8-11</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> The Sabbath was instituted to provide rest and refuge in and through Christ. It’s a special weekly blessing to everyone who chooses to rest from their works by trusting in Him. We may have a long list of things to do, but we can still put them aside in order to have time to connect with God and acknowledge His supremacy in our lives. This rest from work extends to everyone “within our gates” or under our authority.

              And he came to Nazareth, where he had been brought up: and, as his custom was, <em>he went into the synagogue on the sabbath day</em>, and stood up for to read. <cite><b>Luke 4:16</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              Six days shall work be done: but the seventh day is the sabbath of rest, <em>an holy convocation</em>; ye shall do no work therein: it is the sabbath of the LORD in all your dwellings. <cite><b>Leviticus 23:3</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> Looking to Jesus as our example in all things, we learn that Sabbath keeping is also about gathering together with other believers for worship, spiritual nourishment, and fellowship.

            <h2>When does the Sabbath start and end?</h2>
            <p>
              It is to be a Sabbath of complete rest for you, and you shall humble yourselves; on the ninth of the month at evening, <em>from evening until evening</em>, you shall keep your Sabbath. <cite><b>Leviticus 23:32, NASB</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              And God called the light Day, and the darkness he called Night. And <em>the evening and the morning were the first day</em>. <cite><b>Genesis 1:5</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> In the Bible, the day does not actually start and end at midnight; it starts from sunset and lasts until the next day’s sunset. In the Genesis account each day includes the prior evening as well, so since the Sabbath is the seventh day of the week, it would start from sunset on Friday and last until sunset on Saturday.

            <h2>What insight does Isaiah give?</h2>
            <p>
              If thou turn away thy foot from the sabbath, from doing thy pleasure on my holy day; and <em>call the sabbath a delight</em>, the holy of the LORD, honourable; and <em>shalt honour him, not doing thine own ways, nor finding thine own pleasure, nor speaking thine own words</em>: then shalt thou <em>delight thyself in the LORD</em>; and I will cause thee to ride upon the high places of the earth, and feed thee with the heritage of Jacob thy father: for the mouth of the LORD hath spoken it. <cite><b>Isaiah 58:13, 14</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> The Sabbath becomes a delight when it is centered around Jesus&mdash;when we put away our own pursuits and rest from the cares of life in order to focus on the eternal things of God. It’s a special day to reflect on, honor, and connect with Him. Simply put, it’s a day to delight in Him.

            <h2>What can we learn from the experience of Nehemiah?</h2>
            <p>
              In those days <em>saw I in Judah some treading wine presses on the sabbath, and bringing in sheaves, and lading asses; as also wine, grapes, and figs, and all manner of burdens, which they brought into Jerusalem on the sabbath day</em>: and I testified against them in the day wherein they sold victuals. There dwelt men of Tyre also therein, which brought fish, and all manner of ware, and <em>sold on the sabbath</em> unto the children of Judah, and in Jerusalem. Then I contended with the nobles of Judah, and said unto them, What evil thing is this that ye do, and profane the sabbath day? Did not your fathers thus, and did not our God bring all this evil upon us, and upon this city? yet ye bring more wrath upon Israel by profaning the sabbath.
              <br><br>
              And it came to pass, that when the gates of Jerusalem began to be dark before the sabbath, I commanded that the gates should be shut, and charged that they should not be opened till after the sabbath: and some of my servants set I at the gates, that there should no burden be brought in on the sabbath day. So the merchants and sellers of all kind of ware lodged without Jerusalem once or twice. Then I testified against them, and said unto them, Why lodge ye about the wall? if ye do so again, I will lay hands on you. <em>From that time forth came they no more on the sabbath. And I commanded the Levites that they should cleanse themselves, and that they should come and keep the gates, to sanctify the sabbath day</em>.<cite><b>Nehemiah 13:15-22</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> We can clearly see that buying, selling, and conducting business to generate income are activities that profane the Sabbath day. Now this can pose a challenge for some professions; it wouldn’t be right to abandon people requiring medical care on the Sabbath, for example, but as far as it is possible, we should seek to rest from income-generating work in order to honor our Creator.

            <h2>What activities are encouraged on the Sabbath?</h2>
            <p>
              And he said unto them, What man shall there be among you, that shall have one sheep, and if it fall into a pit on the sabbath day, will he not lay hold on it, and lift it out? How much then is a man better than a sheep? Wherefore <em>it is lawful to do well on the sabbath days</em>. Then saith he to the man, Stretch forth thine hand. And he stretched it forth; and it was restored whole, like as the other. <cite><b>Matthew 12:11-13</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> Jesus continued to heal people on the Sabbath, contrary to the tradition of the religious leaders of that day. Ministering to the sick, the needy, and the discouraged by relieving their suffering, whether physical, emotional, or spiritual, is what makes the Sabbath a delight.

            <h2>For whom was the Sabbath instituted?</h2>
            <p>
              And it came to pass, that he went through the corn fields on the sabbath day; and his disciples began, as they went, to pluck the ears of corn. And the Pharisees said unto him, Behold, why do they on the sabbath day that which is not lawful? And he said unto them, Have ye never read what David did, when he had need, and was an hungred, he, and they that were with him? How he went into the house of God in the days of Abiathar the high priest, and did eat the shewbread, which is not lawful to eat but for the priests, and gave also to them which were with him? And he said unto them, <em>The sabbath was made for man, and not man for the sabbath</em>: therefore the Son of man is Lord also of the sabbath. <cite><b>Mark 2:23-28</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> The Pharisees had so many additional man-made rules to ensure the Sabbath was kept holy that they turned it into a burden, but Jesus did not follow these rules. He only followed God’s rules, which are there to ensure the Sabbath is a delight. In fact, He made it quite clear that the Sabbath was made for us, and not the other way around.

            <h2>Will God provide for my needs?</h2>
            <p>
              And the LORD said unto Moses, How long refuse ye to keep my commandments and my laws? See, for that the LORD hath given you the sabbath, therefore <em>he giveth you on the sixth day the bread of two days</em>; abide ye every man in his place, let no man go out of his place on the seventh day. So the people rested on the seventh day. <cite><b>Exodus 16:28-30</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              Wherefore the LORD God of Israel saith, I said indeed that thy house, and the house of thy father, should walk before me for ever: but now the LORD saith, Be it far from me; <em>for them that honour me I will honour</em>, and they that despise me shall be lightly esteemed. <cite><b>1 Samuel 2:30</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> It may be tempting to worry about lost income on the Sabbath, but just as God miraculously provided a double portion of bread for the Israelites on Friday to ensure they had enough for Saturday, He will also provide for our needs today when we choose to honor Him by resting on His holy day.

            <h2>What is faith?</h2>
            <p>
              Now faith is the <em>substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen</em>. <cite><b>Hebrews 11:1</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> Faith is what reaches out and grasps things not seen that are backed up by evidence. In Isaiah 1:18 God says, “Come now, and let us reason together,” which means He does not want anyone to blindly follow Him; on the contrary, He wants faith to be informed by evidence.
            </p>
          </section>
          <section>
            <div>2</div>
            <h2>Why is faith necessary?</h2>
            <p>
              But without faith it is impossible to please him: for <em>he that cometh to God must believe that he is</em>, and <em>that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him</em>. <cite><b>Hebrews 11:6</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> Faith is the means by which my journey with Jesus starts. It is the hand of faith that reaches out to grasp the outstretched hand of God. He is always ready and eager to help those who come to Him, but I must first believe in Him and His goodness. This faith is based on plentiful evidence, but the evidence does not remove the need for faith altogether. There will always be room for doubt for those who want to doubt simply because the finite human mind cannot fully grasp an everlasting, infinite God. Thus the need for faith: God said it&mdash;I believe it.

          <section>
            <div>3</div>
            <h2>How many have faith?</h2>
            <p>
              For I say, through the grace given unto me, to every man that is among you, not to think of himself more highly than he ought to think; but to think soberly, according as <em>God hath dealt to every man the measure of faith</em>. <cite><b>Romans 12:3</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> Fatih is like a muscle; every person has been given a measure of it. Some neglect it, never use it, and it grows weak. Others act on what they have, reaching out to God, and He meets them where they are, revealing Himself to them, which in turn makes their faith stronger, and then they act on that, and it continues to grow each time it is used.

            <h2>What if my faith is weak?</h2>
            <p>
              And the apostles said unto the Lord, <em>Increase our faith</em>. <cite><b>Luke 17:5</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              Jesus said unto him, If thou canst believe, all things are possible to him that believeth. And straightway the father of the child cried out, and said with tears, <em>Lord, I believe; help thou mine unbelief</em>. <cite><b>Mark 9:23, 24</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              Then came the disciples to Jesus apart, and said, Why could not we cast him out? And Jesus said unto them, Because of your unbelief: for verily I say unto you, <em>If ye have faith as a grain of mustard seed</em>, ye shall say unto this mountain, Remove hence to yonder place; and it shall remove; and nothing shall be impossible unto you. <cite><b>Matthew 17:19, 20</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> Even if my faith is weak and small as a tiny seed, I can exercise the faith that I do have, and ask God to increase it, believing in His power to do so, and it will be done.

            <h2>What is faith based on?</h2>
            <p>
              So then faith cometh by hearing, and hearing <em>by the word of God</em>. <cite><b>Romans 10:17</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              Another parable put he forth unto them, saying, The kingdom of heaven is <em>like to a grain of mustard seed</eM>, which a man took, and sowed in his field: which indeed is the least of all seeds: but <em>when it is grown, it is the greatest among herbs, and becometh a tree</em>, so that the birds of the air come and lodge in the branches thereof. <cite><b>Matthew 13:31, 32</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> Faith is primarily based on the evidence of truth revealed in the Word of God, the Bible. Like a seed that is watered by the rain, faith grows whenever it is watered with the truth of His Word and that truth is then internalized&mdash;received and allowed to take root in the heart. With my cooperation, God can take the small seed of faith and make it grow into a tall tree.

            <p>
              And Jesus answering saith unto them, Have faith in God. For verily I say unto you, That whosoever shall say unto this mountain, Be thou removed, and be thou cast into the sea; and shall not doubt in his heart, but shall believe that those things which he saith shall come to pass; he shall have whatsoever he saith. Therefore I say unto you, What things soever ye desire, <em>when ye pray, believe that ye receive them, and ye shall have them</em>. <cite><b>Mark 11:22-24</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              And when he was come into the house, the blind men came to him: and Jesus saith unto them, Believe ye that I am able to do this? They said unto him, Yea, Lord. Then touched he their eyes, saying, <em>According to your faith be it unto you</em>. And their eyes were opened. <cite><b>Matthew 9:28-30</b></cite>

            <h2>What is the power of the gospel dependent on?</h2>
            <p>
              For unto us was the gospel preached, as well as unto them: but the word preached did not profit them, not <em>being mixed with faith in them that heard it</em>. <cite><b>Hebrews 4:2</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> The gospel is the good news of God’s desire and power to save humanity from the misery of sin. When the gospel is mingled with faith, it is acted on and received into the mind and heart, starting a marvelous process of transformation in the life of the receiver through the power of God.

              That ye be not slothful, but followers of them who <em>through faith and patience inherit the promises</em>. <cite><b>Hebrews 6:12</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              <em>These all died in faith, not having received the promises, but having seen them afar off, and were persuaded of them, and embraced them</em>, and confessed that they were strangers and pilgrims on the earth. For they that say such things declare plainly that they seek a country. And truly, if they had been mindful of that country from whence they came out, they might have had opportunity to have returned. But now they desire a better country, that is, an heavenly: wherefore God is not ashamed to be called their God: for he hath prepared for them a city. <cite><b>Hebrews 11:13-16</b></cite>

            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> The Bible shows God is willing to forgive anyone who is truly repentant. When this evidence is acted on by faith, when I take God at His Word, He will forgive me too, just like He forgave the paralytic according to his faith.

            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> Salvation is only through faith. I am made righteous by faith in Jesus’ love as expressed in His willingness to forgive my sins and clothe me with His righteousness. I am also sanctified by faith in His power to save me from my sins. Salvation is completely of God; it is a gift. Faith is the means by which I reach out to Him and recieve that gift.

            <h2>What is evident in those who are saved by faith?</h2>
            <p>
              By whom [Jesus] we have received grace and apostleship, <em>for obedience to the faith</em> among all nations, for his name. <cite><b>Romans 1:5</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              Here is the patience of the saints: here are they that <em>keep the commandments of God, and the faith of Jesus</em>. <cite><b>Revelation 14:12</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> Those who have the faith of Jesus also keep the commandments of God because Jesus Himself kept them. In the book of Romans Paul says Jesus gives us grace for obedience to the faith. Now it is true that I am saved by faith alone, but it is also true that once I am saved by Jesus, my love for Him leads me to obey Him. Obedience is the result of salvation, not the means to it. It can only be born out of love for the One who died for me, and it is made possible by His grace working in me.

            <h2>Is there more evidence of this?</h2>
            <p>
              Even so <em>faith, if it hath not works, is dead</em>, being alone. Yea, a man may say, Thou hast faith, and I have works: shew me thy faith without thy works, and I will shew thee my faith by my works. Thou believest that there is one God; thou doest well: the devils also believe, and tremble. But wilt thou know, O vain man, that <em>faith without works is dead</em>?<cite><b>James 2:17-20</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              Do men gather grapes of thorns, or figs of thistles? Even so <em>every good tree bringeth forth good fruit; but a corrupt tree bringeth forth evil fruit</em>. ... Wherefore <em>by their fruits ye shall know them</em>. Not every one that saith unto me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of heaven; but <em>he that doeth the will of my Father</em> which is in heaven. Many will say to me in that day, Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied in thy name? and in thy name have cast out devils? and in thy name done many wonderful works? And then will I profess unto them, I never knew you: depart from me, ye that work iniquity.<cite><b>Matthew 7:16, 17, 20-23</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> Obedience shows the genuineness of my faith. Put another way, my faith is confirmed, or justified, to me by my works. They are evidence for me, not God, since He already knows my genuine heart (see Psalm 139:1-4), but I do need the evidence because it’s easy to deceive myself about my true condition (see Jeremiah 17:9, 10).

            <p>
              But <em>your iniquities have separated between you and your God</em>, and your sins have hid his face from you, that he will not hear. <cite><b>Isaiah 59:2</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              And she shall bring forth a son, and thou shalt call his name JESUS: for <em>he shall save his people from their sins</em>. <cite><b>Matthew 1:21</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just <em>to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness</em>. <cite><b>1 John 1:9</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              Who his own self bare our sins in his own body on the tree, that we, <em>being dead to sins, should live unto righteousness</em>: by whose stripes ye were healed. <cite><b>1 Peter 2:24</b></cite>
            </p>

            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> Before sin entered the world, Adam and Eve communicated with God face to face. Once they allowed sin to enter their hearts, it separated them from their Creator because sin cannot exist in the presence of a holy God&mdash;His presence is a consuming fire to those who cherish sin (see Deuteronomy 4:24). The Father then sent His Son not only to pay the penalty for sin on our behalf, but also to save us from our sins. He wants to forgive and cleanse us from any and all unrighteousness so that we may be dead to sin and alive to righteousness!

            <h2>What is the first step to victory over sin?</h2>
            <p>
               And if it seem evil unto you to serve the LORD, <em>choose you this day whom ye will serve</em>; whether the gods which your fathers served that were on the other side of the flood, or the gods of the Amorites, in whose land ye dwell: but as for me and my house, we will serve the LORD. <cite><b>Joshua 24:15</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> Sin is a choice, an act of the will because the devil cannot force anyone to sin. I get to choose whom I will serve every single day. Now it’s true that will power without God is my own power, but an act of the will is the first step on the road to victory. Sin can be defeated only if I cooperate with God; He will do for me what I cannot do for myself, but I need to do my part by making a firm choice to serve Him. Jesus raised Lazarus from the dead, but He didn’t roll away the stone because people were capable of doing that themselves. There is also a huge difference between desiring to overcome and choosing to overcome. God is powerless to help me until I make that choice, so whenever temptation comes, my first response can be “No, I choose to serve Christ.”

            <h2>What is the second step?</h2>
            <p>
               But <em>thanks be to God, which giveth us the victory</em> through our Lord Jesus Christ. <cite><b>1 Corinthians 15:57</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
               And Jesus answering saith unto them, <em>Have faith in God</em>. For verily I say unto you, That whosoever shall say unto this mountain, Be thou removed, and be thou cast into the sea; and shall not doubt in his heart, but shall believe that those things which he saith shall come to pass; he shall have whatsoever he saith. Therefore I say unto you, What things soever ye desire, when ye pray, <em>believe that ye receive them</em>, and ye shall have them. <cite><b>Mark 11:22-24</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
               And this is the confidence that we have in him, that, <em>if we ask any thing according to his will, he heareth us</em>. And if we know that he hear us, whatsoever we ask, we know that we have the petitions that we desired of him.  <cite><b>1 John 5:14, 15</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> The Bible is clear that it’s God will for me to have victory over sin. The Bible also says anything that I ask in faith according to His will He will do, and Paul even encourages me to thank God for the victory He gives me through Jesus. Just like the Israelites gave a loud shout of victory before the walls of Jericho came down (Joshua 6:16), I can claim that victory by faith and thank God for it. Faith in the power of God is crucial; it is the difference between merely asking for victory and believing it. The victory is a gift that needs to be received and accepted. So after saying “No, I choose to serve Christ,” my second response to temptation can be “Thank you God for the victory that is mine through Jesus.”

            <h2>What is the third step?</h2>
            <p>
               Likewise <em>reckon ye also yourselves to be dead indeed unto sin</em>, but alive unto God through Jesus Christ our Lord. Let not sin therefore reign in your mortal body, that ye should obey it in the lusts thereof. Neither yield ye your members as instruments of unrighteousness unto sin: but yield yourselves unto God, as those that are alive from the dead, and your members as instruments of righteousness unto God. For sin shall not have dominion over you. <cite><b>Romans 6:11-14</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> Through the righteousness of Jesus and the power of the Holy Spirit in me I can be dead to sin. Temptation has no power over a corpse, and I can be just as dead to it. After thanking God for the victory, I can follow it up with “I am dead to this sin.” And remember, dying to sin is not divorcing a best friend, but an evil enemy. It is a cause for joy and celebration! So do not crawl, but run from it like Joseph did (Genesis 39:12).

            <h2>Is it smart to dwell on the temptation?</h2>
            <p>
              Blessed is the man that endureth temptation: for when he is tried, he shall receive the crown of life, which the Lord hath promised to them that love him. Let no man say when he is tempted, I am tempted of God: for God cannot be tempted with evil, neither tempteth he any man: but every man is tempted, when he is drawn away of his own lust, and enticed. Then <em>when lust hath conceived, it bringeth forth sin</em>: and sin, when it is finished, bringeth forth death. <cite><b>James 1:12-15</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              Wherefore <em>gird up the loins of your mind</em>, be sober, and hope to the end for the grace that is to be brought unto you at the revelation of Jesus Christ. <cite><b>1 Peter 1:13</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              Casting down imaginations, and every high thing that exalteth itself against the knowledge of God, and <em>bringing into captivity every thought to the obedience of Christ</em>. <cite><b>2 Corinthians 10:5</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> Sin occurs when the door of the mind is opened, and it’s then let inside and entertained. Temptation becomes sin when it’s cherished in the mind and, in the words of James, allowed to conceive sin. Peter calls us to bind the mind, like a soldier binds his belt in preparation for action, so the mind is ready to deal with temptation. Paul invites us to bring every thought into captivity to Christ because a sinful thought immediately rejected does not have strength. The faster I turn to God the safer I am, and the more I do it the easier it gets.

            <h2>How did Jesus meet temptation?</h2>
            <p>
              And when the tempter came to him, he said, If thou be the Son of God, command that these stones be made bread. But he answered and said, <em>It is written</em>, Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God. <cite><b>Matthew 4:3, 4</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              For <em>the word of God is living and powerful, and sharper than any two-edged sword</em>, piercing even to the division of soul and spirit, and of joints and marrow, and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart. <cite><b>Hebrews 4:12, NKJV</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              <em>Your word I have hidden in my heart</em>, that I might not sin against You. <cite><b>Psalm 119:11</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              But we all, with open face <em>beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord, are changed into the same image</em> from glory to glory, even as by the Spirit of the Lord. <cite><b>2 Corinthians 3:18</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> Jesus met temptation by quoting Scripture. Hebrews tells us the Bible is alive, powerful, and sharper than any sword. When I store His word in my mind by reading it daily and memorizing favorite passages, I am “girding” up my mind. Furthermore, I become what I behold, so by beholding the character of Christ as revealed in His word, my character will be transformed to reflect His character through the work of the Holy Spirit. The next time temptation comes, let’s follow the example of our Redeemer and turn to the Bible to give us victory!

            </p>
            <p>
              This I say then, <em>Walk in the Spirit</em>, and ye shall not fulfil the lust of the flesh. <cite><b>Galatians 5:16</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              <em>Commit thy works unto the LORD</em>, and thy thoughts shall be established. <cite><b>Proverbs 16:3</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              And if thy right hand offend thee, <em>cut it off</em>, and cast it from thee: for it is profitable for thee that one of thy members should perish, and not that thy whole body should be cast into hell. <cite><b>Matthew 5:30</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> The Bible invites me to “put on Christ” and “walk in the Spirit.” I do this by beginning every day sitting at His feet, like Mary did (Luke 10:39), reading His Word and asking Him to convert my heart and mind. Then I commit my will to Him for that day. And then I “make no provision for the flesh” by removing myself from temptation and doing all that I can to create an environment that is free from it. When I leave room for temptation I am telling myself I will fail, so throw it out, pour it out, delete the app, cancel the subscription, cut the cable.

The walls of sin in our lives are the same until we ask God to get involved and intervene on our behalf, and the promise is that Jesus Christ is mighty to pull them down! It’s not about how many times I’ve fallen, but whether I got up and went to the Father who is waiting for me with outstretched arms. I can never think of yourself as a hopeless case; it’s not from God. My past history is not my legacy or destiny. It’s not “I'd like to be an overcomer,” or “I hope to be.” Through the grace and power of Christ in my life I am an overcomer!

            <h2>What is the most powerful motivation for overcoming sin?</h2>
            <p>
              For the <em>preaching of the cross</em> is to them that perish foolishness; but <em>unto us which are saved it is the power of God</em>. <cite><b>1 Corinthians 1:18</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
               That Christ may dwell in your hearts by faith; that ye, <em>being rooted and grounded in love</em>, may be able to comprehend with all saints what is the breadth, and length, and depth, and height; and <em>to know the love of Christ</em>, which passeth knowledge, that ye might be filled with all the fulness of God. <cite><b>Ephesians 3:17-19</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
               <em>We love him</em>, because he first loved us. <cite><b>1 John 4:19</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> The more time I spend thinking about what Jesus did for me on the cross, the more my love for Him will grow and my abhorence for sin will increase. Sin is so evil that it required the Son of God to leave the courts of heaven, take on human nature, live a perfect life while assailed by the devil on every side, and die the death of the worse criminal on the cross because the Creator God was the only One who could pay the penalty for my sins. Let’s get grounded in the love of Christ as revealed on the cross, so it becomes the driving motivation for victory over sin. The more I love Him the more I’ll hate those things that separate me from Him and are repulsive to His character.

            <h2>What does Revelation say about those who overcome?</h2>
            <p>
              And <em>they overcame him by the blood of the Lamb</em>, and by the word of their testimony; and they loved not their lives unto the death. <cite><b>Revelation 12:11</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              <em>To him that overcometh will I grant to sit with me on my throne</em>, even as I also overcame, and am set down with my Father on his throne. <cite><b>Revelation 3:21</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              The four and twenty elders fall down before him that sat on the throne, and worship him that liveth for ever and ever, and <em>cast their crowns before the throne, saying, Thou art worthy, O Lord, to receive glory and honour and power</em>: for thou hast created all things, and for thy pleasure they are and were created. <cite><b>Revelation 4:10, 11</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> There is power in what Jesus did on the cross because Revelation says the saints overcame Satan by the blood of Jesus Christ. He gives them the victory, and then He grants them to sit on His throne! This is an echo of how the Father treated His prodigal son. Such treatment is completely undeserved, but He does it anyway out of His immeasurable love for His children. No wonder the saints in heaven will cast their crowns before His throne in worship and adoration saying that He is worthy to receive glory, honor, and power.
