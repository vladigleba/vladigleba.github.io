            <h2>How much of the Bible is inspired by God? For what purpose?</h2>
            <p>
              <em>All</em> Scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable <em>for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness</em>, that the man of God may be perfect, throughly furnished unto all good works. <cite><b>2 Timothy 3:16, 17</b></cite>

            <div>2</div>
            <h2>How did it maintain its miraculous unity?</h2>
            <p>
              Knowing this first, that no prophecy of the scripture is of any private interpretation. For the prophecy came not in old time by the will of man: but holy men of God spake <em>as they were moved by the Holy Ghost</em>. <cite><b>2 Peter 1:20, 21</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> The Bible was written over a period of 1,500 years by about 40 different authors whose education and background varied greatly. The Bible’s unity under these circumstances is astonishing and can only be explained by divine inspiration.

            <p>
              <em>Thy word is true from the beginning</em>, and every one of thy righteous judgments endureth for ever. <cite><b>Psalm 119:160</b></cite>

            <h2>But hasn’t it been corrupted over the ages?</h2>
            <p>

              The words of the LORD are <em>pure words</em>, as silver tried in a furnace of earth, purified seven times. Thou shalt keep them, O LORD, thou shalt <em>preserve them</em> from this generation for ever. <cite><b>Psalm 12:6, 7</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> God’s word is truth, and He will ensure it stays that way.

            <h2>Can God’s Word be changed or done away with?</h2>
            <p>
              Heaven and earth shall pass away, but <em>my words shall not pass away</em>. <cite><b>Matthew 24:35</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              For all flesh is as grass, and all the glory of man as the flower of grass. The grass withereth, and the flower thereof falleth away: but <em>the word of the LORD endureth for ever</em>. And this is the word which by the gospel is preached unto you. <cite><b>1 Peter 1:24, 25</b></cite>

            <h2>Why did God give us the Scriptures?</h2>
            <p>
              For whatsoever things were written aforetime were written <em>for our learning</em>, that we through patience and comfort of the scriptures <em>might have hope</em>. <cite><b>Romans 15:4</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              For this is good and acceptable in the sight of God our Savior, <em>who will have all men to be saved, and to come unto the knowledge of the truth</em>. <cite><b>1 Timothy 2:3, 4</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              And that from a child thou hast known the holy scriptures, which are able <em>to make thee wise unto salvation</em> through faith which is in Christ Jesus. <cite><b>2 Timothy 3:15</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> God gave us the Scriptures so we can learn about His character and be grounded in His truth while navigating a world of deception, so that through it we might be saved from sin and have hope of eternal life.

            <h2>Who do the Scriptures point me to?</h2>
            <p>
              Search the scriptures; for in them ye think ye have eternal life: and they are they which <em>testify of me</em>. <cite><b>John 5:39</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              Looking unto Jesus the <em>author and finisher of our faith</em>; who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross, despising the shame, and is set down at the right hand of the throne of God. <cite><b>Hebrews 12:2</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              Jesus saith unto him, <em>I am the way, the truth, and the life</em>: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me. <cite><b>John 14:6</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> All the stories of the Bible point me to Jesus, the Author and Finisher of my faith.

            <h2>How can I be blessed by the Bible?</h2>
            <p>
              <em>Study</em> to shew thyself approved unto God, a workman that needeth not to be ashamed, rightly dividing the word of truth. <cite><b>2 Timothy 2:15</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              These were more noble than those in Thessalonica, in that they received the word with all readiness of mind, and <em>searched the scriptures daily</em>, whether those things were so. <cite><b>Acts 17:11</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> The Bible is unlike any other book because it is my Creator and Redeemer’s special gift to me. He speaks to me through it, and it is my privilege to read it daily because by doing so I’ll draw closer to Him. Every relationship is built on spending quality time together, and my relationship with Jesus is no different.

            <h2>Is God’s Word as important as physical food?</h2>
            <p>
              But he answered and said, It is written, Man shall not live by bread alone, but by <em>every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God</em>. <cite><b>Matthew 4:4</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              Neither have I gone back from the commandment of his lips; I have esteemed the words of his mouth <em>more than my necessary food</em>. <cite><b>Job 23:12</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that believeth on me hath everlasting life. <em>I am that bread of life</em>. Your fathers did eat manna in the wilderness, and are dead. This is the bread which cometh down from heaven, that a man may eat thereof, and not die. I am the living bread which came down from heaven: <em>if any man eat of this bread, he shall live for ever</em>: and the bread that I will give is my flesh, which I will give for the life of the world. <cite><b>John 6:47-51</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> Jesus is the spiritual bread that brings everlasting life, and we “eat” it whenever we read His Word. Our need for Him is actually greater than our need for physical food.

            <h2>Who did Jesus say will help me understand the Bible?</h2>
            <p>
              Howbeit when he, <em>the Spirit of truth</em>, is come, he <em>will guide you into all truth</em>: for he shall not speak of himself; but whatsoever he shall hear, that shall he speak: and he will shew you things to come. <cite><b>John 16:13</b></cite>

            <h2>Why should I ask for the Holy Spirit’s guidance?</h2>
            <p>
              Which things also we speak, not in the words which man's wisdom teacheth, but which the Holy Ghost teacheth; comparing spiritual things with spiritual. But the natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God: for they are foolishness unto him: neither can he know them, <em>because they are spiritually discerned</em>. <cite><b>1 Corinthians 2:13, 14</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> Because spiritual things are spiritually discerned and because the Bible is full of stories with symbolism that goes multiple levels deep, I need the Holy Spirit to open my spiritual eyes and help me bring these stories to life. Humility and a teachable attitude is also a crucial part of it.

            <h2>How should I study the Bible?</h2>
            <p>
              Whom shall he teach knowledge? and whom shall he make to understand doctrine? them that are weaned from the milk, and drawn from the breasts. For precept must be upon precept, <em>precept upon precept; line upon line</em>, line upon line; <em>here a little, and there a little</em>. <cite><b>Isaiah 28:9, 10</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> God is not a God of contradiction or confusion, so it’s important to not take verses out of context and build a doctrine based on a verse or two. When studying a particular topic, it’s critical to identify as many verses as possible dealing with the topic and to let the Bible clarify itself on what seem, due to our misunderstanding, like contradictory ones.
            </p>

            <h2>What will the truth in God’s Word do to me?</h2>
            <p>
              <em>Sanctify them</em> through thy truth: thy word is truth. <cite><b>John 17:17</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              But we all, with open face <em>beholding as in a glass the glory of the LORD, are changed into the same image</em> from glory to glory, even as by the Spirit of the LORD. <cite><b>2 Corinthians 3:18</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              For <em>the word of God is living and powerful</em>, and sharper than any two-edged sword, piercing even to the division of soul and spirit, and of joints and marrow, and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart. <cite><b>Hebrews 4:12, NKJV</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> Reading the Bible brings me into contact with God’s divine mind and holy character, and by beholding it daily, I become more like Him through the work of the Holy Spirit. There is a reason the book of Hebrews calls the word of God living and powerful!

            <p class="note">

            </p>
            <p>
              I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the ending, saith the LORD, <em>which is, and which was, and which is to come</em>, the Almighty. <cite><b>Revelation 1:8</b></cite>

              Remember the former things of old: for I am God, and there is none else; I am God, and there is none like me, <em>declaring the end from the beginning</em>, and from ancient times the things that are not yet done, saying, My counsel shall stand, and I will do all my pleasure. <cite><b>Isaiah 46:9, 10</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              My frame was not hidden from You, when I was made in secret, and skillfully wrought in the lowest parts of the earth. Your eyes saw my substance, being yet unformed. And <em>in Your book they all were written, the days fashioned for me, when as yet there were none of them</em>. <cite><b>Psalm 139:15, 16, NKJV</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              Surely the Lord GOD will do nothing, but <em>he revealeth his secret unto his servants the prophets</em>. <cite><b>Amos 3:7</b></cite>

            <p>
              Another parable put he forth unto them, saying, The kingdom of heaven is likened unto a man which sowed good seed in his field: But while men slept, <em>his enemy came and sowed tares among the wheat</em>, and went his way. But when the blade was sprung up, and brought forth fruit, then appeared the tares also. So the servants of the householder came and said unto him, Sir, didst not thou sow good seed in thy field? from whence then hath it tares? He said unto them, <em>An enemy hath done this</em>. <cite><b>Matthew 13:24-28</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> God cannot be the originator of evil because that is contrary to His character of love. It was an enemy of God that was responsible for the birth of evil.

            <h2>Was Lucifer perfect when God created him?</h2>
            <p>
              Thou sealest up the sum, full of wisdom, and perfect in beauty. Thou hast been in Eden the garden of God; every precious stone was thy covering, the sardius, topaz, and the diamond, the beryl, the onyx, and the jasper, the sapphire, the emerald, and the carbuncle, and gold: the workmanship of thy tabrets and of thy pipes was prepared in thee in the day that thou wast created. <em>Thou art the anointed cherub that covereth</em>; and I have set thee so: thou wast upon the holy mountain of God; thou hast walked up and down in the midst of the stones of fire. <em>Thou wast perfect in thy ways from the day that thou wast created, till iniquity was found in thee</em>. <cite><b>Ezekiel 28:12-15</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              The Lord reigneth; let the people tremble: <em>he sitteth between the cherubims</em>; let the earth be moved. <cite><b>Psalm 99:1</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> In Ezekiel 28 Lucifer is symbolized as the “prince of Tyre,” and we learn that he was created perfect. He was also a covering cherub, which means he had a high position in heaven and was next to God’s very presence. It’s unknown how long perfection existed in heaven, but eventually evil was born in Lucifer’s heart because he aall of God’s angels had freedom of choice. This is a risk God willingly took because genuine love cannot exist without a free will.

              By the multitude of thy merchandise they have filled the midst of thee with violence, and thou hast sinned: therefore I will cast thee as profane out of the mountain of God: and I will destroy thee, O covering cherub, from the midst of the stones of fire. <em>Thine heart was lifted up because of thy beauty</em>, thou hast corrupted thy wisdom <em>by reason of thy brightness</em>: I will cast thee to the ground, I will lay thee before kings, that they may behold thee. <cite><b>Ezekiel 28:16-17</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              How art thou fallen from heaven, O Lucifer, son of the morning! how art thou cut down to the ground, which didst weaken the nations! For thou hast said in thine heart, I will ascend into heaven, <em>I will exalt my throne above the stars of God</em>: I will sit also upon the mount of the congregation, in the sides of the north: I will ascend above the heights of the clouds; <em>I will be like the most High</em>. <cite><b>Isaiah 14:12-14</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> Lucifer allowed his beauty to fill him with pride, and he started to envy God’s power, His throne, and the worship of the angels. Eventually, his goal was to unseat God.

            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> Lucifer was able to convince other angels to join him in his rebellion, leading to war in heaven. God could have then destroyed him, but He did not want the remaining angels to worship Him out of fear, so He cast Lucifer out of heaven and gave him an opportunity to demonstrate what would be the result of sin and rebellion. Would it bring more prosperity and happiness than God’s form of government?

            <h2>What did God do next?</h2>
            <p>
              So <em>God created man in his own image</em>, in the image of God created he him; male and female created he them. And God blessed them, and God said unto them, <em>Be fruitful, and multiply</em>, and replenish the earth, and subdue it: and have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth.
              <br><br>
              And God said, Behold, I have given you every herb bearing seed, which is upon the face of all the earth, and every tree, in the which is the fruit of a tree yielding seed; to you it shall be for meat. And to every beast of the earth, and to every fowl of the air, and to every thing that creepeth upon the earth, wherein there is life, I have given every green herb for meat: and it was so. And God saw every thing that he had made, and, behold, <em>it was very good</em>. And the evening and the morning were the sixth day. <cite><b>Genesis 1:27-31</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              And the LORD God took the man, and put him into the garden of Eden to dress it and to keep it. And the LORD God commanded the man, saying, Of every tree of the garden thou mayest freely eat: But <em>of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not eat of it</em>: for in the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die. <cite><b>Genesis 2:15-17</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> After losing some of His angels, God created a new order of beings after His own image. Adam and Eve were to be independent judges between the government of God and that of Satan since they did not witness the conflict in heaven. God gave them a perfect start, everything they needed for happiness and prosperity, but like His angels, they also had free will, and in order to be fair to Satan, God gave him access to them at the tree.

            <h2>What lie did Satan tell Eve that was an echo of Isaiah 14:14?</h2>
            <p>
              Now the serpent was more subtil than any beast of the field which the LORD God had made. And he said unto the woman, Yea, hath God said, Ye shall not eat of every tree of the garden? And the woman said unto the serpent, We may eat of the fruit of the trees of the garden: But of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden, God hath said, Ye shall not eat of it, neither shall ye touch it, lest ye die. And the serpent said unto the woman, Ye shall not surely die: For God doth know that in the day ye eat thereof, then <em>your eyes shall be opened, and ye shall be as gods, knowing good and evil</em>. <cite><b>Genesis 3:1-5</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> Satan used a serpent to deceive Eve and contradict God by telling her that not only would she not die if she ate the fruit, but she would also become like God, which is exactly what Satan himself desired in heaven. The implication was that God was holding her back from reaching her fullest potential, and Satan was actually the one who had her best interests in mind, not God.

            <p>
              And when the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that it was pleasant to the eyes, and a tree to be desired to make one wise, she took of the fruit thereof, and did eat, and gave also unto her husband with her; and he did eat. And <em>the eyes of them both were opened, and they knew that they were naked</em>; and they sewed fig leaves together, and made themselves aprons. <cite><b>Genesis 3:6-7</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> In order to deceive Eve, Satan mixed in some truth with his lie when he said she would know good and evil because now that they had sinned against God, Adam and Eve lost their innocence, and their eyes were indeed opened to shame, grief, suffering, pain, and death, but they did not ascend to a higher state of existence, as Satan had promised. It was not God’s will for them to know evil, but because Adam and Eve had chosen to believe Satan’s version of reality, he was now free to proceed with establishing his form of government on Earth.

            </p>
            <p>
              Behold, the LORD'S hand is not shortened, that it cannot save; neither his ear heavy, that it cannot hear: But <em>your iniquities have separated between you and your God</em>, and your sins have hid his face from you, that he will not hear. <cite><b>Isaiah 59:1, 2</b></cite>

            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> As soon as Adam and Eve sinned, they hid from God for the first time. Sin leads to separation from God because sin cannot exist in the presence of a holy God without being consumed by it.

By paying for our sins, Jesus made it possible for anyone who receives this free gift by faith through repentance of sins to be forgiven and declared righteous before God!

And they said, What is that to us? see thou to that. And <em>he cast down the pieces of silver in the temple</em>, and departed, and went and hanged himself. And the chief priests took the silver pieces, and said, It is not lawful for to put them into the treasury, because it is the price of blood.

Then <em>God blessed them</em>, and God said to them, “Be fruitful and multiply; fill the earth and subdue it; have dominion over the fish of the sea, over the birds of the air, and over every living thing that moves on the earth.” And God said, “See, I have given you every herb that yields seed which is on the face of all the earth, and every tree whose fruit yields seed; to you it shall be for food. Also, to every beast of the earth, to every bird of the air, and to everything that creeps on the earth, in which there is life, I have given every green herb for food”; and it was so. Then <em>God saw everything that He had made, and indeed it was very good</em>. So the evening and the morning were the sixth day. <cite><b>Genesis 1:27-31</b></cite>

              <b>Note:</b> Sin started the process of decay and death on the earth that would affect not just Adam and Eve, but every other living thing on it.

              When Jesus had raised Himself up and saw no one but the woman, He said to her, “Woman, where are those accusers of yours? Has no one condemned you?” She said, “No one, Lord.” And Jesus said to her, “Neither do I condemn you; <em>go and sin no more</em>.” <cite><b>John 8:10, 11</b></cite>

            <h2>How can He give me victory over all of my sins?</h2>
            <p>
              <em>Ask, and it will be given to you</em>; seek, and you will find; knock, and it will be opened to you. <em>For everyone who asks receives</em>, and he who seeks finds, and to him who knocks it will be opened. <cite><b>Matthew 7:7, 8</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              Now this is the confidence that we have in Him, that <em>if we ask anything according to His will, He hears us</em>. <cite><b>1 John 5:14</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              What shall we then say to these things? <em>If God be for us, who can be against us</em>? He that spared not His own Son, but delivered Him up for us all, <em>how shall He not with Him also freely give us all things</em>? <cite><b>Romans 8:31, 32, KJV</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> There is no sin too powerful for God, but He cannot do anything against my will either. If I confess my sins and ask Him to give me victory over them, believing that He is powerful enough to do it, He will do it according to my faith.

            </p>
            <p>
              He will turn again, he will have compassion upon us; he will <em>subdue our iniquities</em>; and thou wilt cast <em>all their sins</em> into the depths of the sea. <cite><b>Micah 7:19, KJV</b></cite>

            <p class="note">
              <b>Note: </b> God wants to free me from the power of sin because sin hurts me. He can also give me the power to be free because I cannot change myself, just like a leopard cannot change his spots, but He can! He promises to give a new heart and a new spirit to those who ask Him.

            <p>
              Now in the second year of Nebuchadnezzar’s reign, Nebuchadnezzar <em>had dreams</em>; and his spirit was so troubled that his sleep left him. <cite><b>Daniel 2:1</b></cite>

            <p>
              Then <em>the king gave the command</em> to call the magicians, the astrologers, the sorcerers, and the Chaldeans <em>to tell the king his dreams</em>. So they came and stood before the king. And the king said to them, “I have had a dream, and my spirit is anxious to know the dream.” Then the Chaldeans spoke to the king in Aramaic, “O king, live forever! Tell your servants the dream, and we will give the interpretation.”
              <br><br>
              The king answered and said to the Chaldeans, “My decision is firm: if you do not make known the dream to me, and its interpretation, you shall be cut in pieces, and your houses shall be made an ash heap. However, if you tell the dream and its interpretation, you shall receive from me gifts, rewards, and great honor. Therefore tell me the dream and its interpretation.” They answered again and said, “Let the king tell his servants the dream, and we will give its interpretation.”
              <br><br>
              The king answered and said, “I know for certain that you would gain time, because you see that my decision is firm: if you do not make known the dream to me, there is only one decree for you! For you have agreed to speak lying and corrupt words before me till the time has changed. Therefore tell me the dream, and I shall know that you can give me its interpretation.”
              <br><br>
              The Chaldeans answered the king, and said, “There is not a man on earth who can tell the king’s matter; therefore no king, lord, or ruler has ever asked such things of any magician, astrologer, or Chaldean. <em>It is a difficult thing that the king requests, and there is no other who can tell it to the king except the gods</em>, whose dwelling is not with flesh.”
              <br><br>
              For this reason <em>the king was angry and very furious, and gave the command to destroy all the wise men of Babylon</em>.  <cite><b>Daniel 2:2-12</b></cite>

              <b>Note:</b> After the Roman empire crumled in A.D. 476, it was divided by barbarian tribes into numerous kingdoms symbolized by the toes on the image, seven of which exist today: the Ostrogoths (gone), Visigoths (Spain), Franks (France), Vandals (gone), Alemannians (Germany), Sueves (Portugal), Anglo-Saxons (England), Heruli (gone), and Lombards (Italy).

              And in the days of these kings the God of heaven will set up <em>a kingdom which shall never be destroyed</em>; and the kingdom shall not be left to other people; it shall break in pieces and consume all these kingdoms, and <em>it shall stand forever</em>. Inasmuch as you saw that the stone was cut out of the mountain without hands, and that it broke in pieces the iron, the bronze, the clay, the silver, and the gold&mdash;the great God has made known to the king what will come to pass after this. The dream is certain, and its interpretation is sure. <cite><b>Daniel 2:44-45</b></cite>

            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> The stone cut without hands represents the kingdom of heaven, which will replace all the earthly kingdoms at the coming of Christ, and His reign will have no end. Since the stone strikes the image’s feet, Jesus will come during the time of the divided nations.

The enemy who sowed them is the devil, the harvest is the end of the age, and the reapers are the angels.

            <p>
              Now I saw heaven opened, and behold, a white horse. And He who sat on him was called Faithful and True, and in righteousness He judges and makes war. His eyes were like a flame of fire, and <em>on His head were many crowns</em>. He had a name written that no one knew except Himself. He was clothed with a robe dipped in blood, and His name is called The Word of God. And <em>the armies in heaven, clothed in fine linen, white and clean, followed Him</em> on white horses. Now out of His mouth goes a sharp sword, that with it He should strike the nations. And He Himself will rule them with a rod of iron. He Himself treads the winepress of the fierceness and wrath of Almighty God. And He has on His robe and on His thigh a name written: <em>KING OF KINGS AND LORD OF LORDS</em>. <cite><b>Revelation 19:11-16</b></cite>
            </p>

            <h2>What is the first sign Jesus mentions?</h2>
            <p>
              And as he sat upon the mount of Olives, the disciples came unto him privately, saying, Tell us, when shall these things be? and what shall be the sign of thy coming, and of the end of the world? And Jesus answered and said unto them, <em>Take heed that no man deceive you. For many shall come in my name, saying, I am Christ; and shall deceive many</em>. <cite><b>Matthew 24:3-5, KJV</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              For <em>false christs and false prophets will rise and show great signs and wonders to deceive</em>, if possible, even the elect. <cite><b>Matthew 24:24</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              For such are false apostles, deceitful workers, transforming themselves into apostles of Christ. And no wonder! For <em>Satan himself transforms himself into an angel of light</em>. <cite><b>2 Corinthians 11:13, 14</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> Jesus is emphasizing that deception will not only be prevelant in the lead-up to His coming, but it will also be powerful because it will be accompanied by signs and wonders. And it’s not just people who can pretend to be something they’re not, but Satan himself can appear as an angel of light.

              And you will hear of <em>wars and rumors of wars</em>. See that you are not troubled; for all these things must come to pass, but the end is not yet. For nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom. And <em>there will be famines, pestilences, and earthquakes in various places</em>. <cite><b>Matthew 24:6, 7</b></cite>

              For you yourselves know perfectly that the day of the Lord so comes as a thief in the night. <em>For when they say, “Peace and safety!” then sudden destruction comes upon them</em>, as labor pains upon a pregnant woman. And they shall not escape. <cite><b>1 Thessalonians 5:2, 3</b></cite>

            <p class="note">

              But know this, that in the last days perilous times will come: for men will be <em>lovers of themselves, lovers of money, boasters, proud, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy, unloving, unforgiving, slanderers, without self-control, brutal, despisers of good, traitors, headstrong, haughty, lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of God, having a form of godliness but denying its power</em>.

            </p>
            <p>
              But <em>as the days of Noah were, so also will the coming of the Son of Man be</em>. For as in the days before the flood, they were eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, until the day that Noah entered the ark, and did not know until the flood came and took them all away, so also will the coming of the Son of Man be. <cite><b>Matthew 24:37-39</b></cite>

            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> There’s nothing wrong with marriage as it was instituted and blessed by God, and it’s impossible to survive without nourishing our bodies. The point is in Noah’s days most people ignored him. Life is busy, and it’s easy to get preoccupied with temporal things and neglect spiritual things. Where do our own priorities stand?

Indeed <em>the wages of the laborers who mowed your fields, which you kept back by fraud, cry out</em>; and the cries of the reapers have reached the ears of the Lord of Sabaoth. You have lived on the earth in pleasure and luxury; you have fattened your hearts as in a day of slaughter. <cite><b>James 5:1-5</b></cite>

              <b>Note:</b> Rising wealth inequality and trouble between capital and labor will continue to be prominent until the coming of Christ.

            <h2>What advice and promise does the Bible give?</h2>
            <p>
              <em>Watch therefore</em>, for you do not know what hour your Lord is coming. But know this, that if the master of the house had known what hour the thief would come, he would have watched and not allowed his house to be broken into. Therefore you also <em>be ready</em>, for the Son of Man is coming at an hour you do not expect. <cite><b>Matthew 24:42-44</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              Watch therefore, and <em>pray always</em> that you may be counted worthy to escape all these things that will come to pass, and to stand before the Son of Man. <cite><b>Luke 21:36</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              I will say of the Lord, “<em>He is my refuge and my fortress; my God, in Him I will trust</em>.” Surely <em>He shall deliver you</em> from the snare of the fowler and from the perilous pestilence. He shall cover you with His feathers, and under His wings you shall take refuge; <em>His truth shall be your shield and buckler</em>. <cite><b>Psalm 91:2-4</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> Those who watch for signs of Christ’s coming and pray that He will help them to be ready to meet Him won’t be disappointed. His truth will protect them from deception, and God will be with them every step of the way, no matter what happens.

            <h2>Has the judgment already begun?</h2>
            <p>
              Then I saw another angel flying in the midst of heaven, having the everlasting gospel to preach to those who dwell on the earth&mdash;to every nation, tribe, tongue, and people&mdash;saying with a loud voice, “Fear God and give glory to Him, <em>for the hour of His judgment has come</em>; and worship Him who made heaven and earth, the sea and springs of water.” <cite><b>Revelation 14:6,7</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              And behold, I am coming quickly, and My reward is with Me, <em>to give to every one according to his work</em>. <cite><b>Revelation 22:12</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> In Revelation 14 there are three angels proclaiming a message to the people of the world in the last days, and the first angel’s message is that the judgment has begun. So the judgment begins in the last days, which we are living in. When Jesus comes back to Earth He’s bringing a reward with Him, which means the judgment has already taken place to decide who will be saved.

            </p>
            <p>
              So then <em>each of us shall give account of himself to God</em>. <cite><b>Romans 14:12</b></cite>

            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> Every person who has ever lived on planet Earth will be judged. Furthermore, each person will be responsible for his or her own actions; it will not be possible to hide behind another person’s decisions, actions, or ultimatums.

              I beheld till the thrones were cast down, and <em>the Ancient of Days did sit</em>, whose garment was white as snow, and the hair of his head like the pure wool: his throne was like the fiery flame, and his wheels as burning fire. A fiery stream issued and came forth from before him: thousand thousands ministered unto him, and ten thousand times ten thousand stood before him: the <em>judgment was set, and the books were opened</em>. <cite><b>Daniel 7:9, 10, KJV</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              For the Father judges no one, but has <em>committed all judgment to the Son</em>. <cite><b>John 5:22</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              My little children, these things I write to you, so that you may not sin. And if anyone sins, <em>we have an Advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous</em>. <cite><b>1 John 2:1</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              So the great dragon was cast out, that serpent of old, called <em>the Devil and Satan</em>, who deceives the whole world; he was cast to the earth ... for <em>the accuser of our brethren</em>, who accused them before our God day and night, has been cast down. <cite><b>Revelation 12:9, 10</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> God the Father, the Ancient of Days, presides over the judgment, while Jesus is the Judge, as well as our Advocate! Satan is our only accusser, declaring that we don’t deserve to be saved any more than he does.

            <p>
              Let us hear the conclusion of the whole matter: Fear God, and keep his commandments: for this is the whole duty of man. For <em>God shall bring every work into judgment, with every secret thing</em>, whether it be good, or whether it be evil. <cite><b>Ecclesiastes 12:13, 14, KJV</b></cite>

            </p>
            <p>
              And there is no creature hidden from His sight, but <em>all things are naked and open to the eyes of Him to whom we must give account</em>. <cite><b>Hebrews 4:13</b></cite>

            <h2>Does God keep a record of evidence for the judgment?</h2>
            <p>
              And I saw the dead, small and great, standing before God, and books were opened. And another book was opened, which is the Book of Life. And <em>the dead were judged according to their works, by the things which were written in the books</em>. <cite><b>Revelation 20:12</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              But there shall by no means enter it anything that defiles, or causes an abomination or a lie, but <em>only those who are written in the Lamb’s Book of Life</em>. <cite><b>Revelation 21:27</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              “For though you wash yourself with lye, and use much soap, yet <em>your iniquity is marked before Me</em>,” says the Lord God. <cite><b>Jeremiah 2:22</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              Then those who feared the Lord spoke to one another, and the Lord listened attentively and heard it, and a <em>book of remembrance was written before Him for those who fear the Lord and esteem His name</em>. <cite><b>Malachi 3:16, NASB</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> Evidence for the judgment comes from books containing every detail of a person’s life, including every sin. There is also a Book of Remembrance containing every kind word, unselfish act, or sacrifice made by those who follow Jesus as evidence of God’s transforming power in their lives. These people’s names are also written in the Book of Life.

            <h2>What is God’s standard in the judgment?</h2>
            <p>
              If you really fulfill the royal law according to the Scripture, “You shall love your neighbor as yourself,” you do well; but if you show partiality, you commit sin, and are <em>convicted by the law as transgressors</em>. For whoever shall keep the whole law, and yet stumble in one point, he is guilty of all. For He who said, “Do not commit adultery,” also said, “Do not murder.” Now if you do not commit adultery, but you do murder, you have become a transgressor of the law. So speak and so do as those who <em>will be judged by the law of liberty</em>. <cite><b>James 2:10-12</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              Whosoever committeth sin transgresseth also the law: for <em>sin is the transgression of the law</em>. <cite><b>1 John 3:4, KJV</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> If God keeps a record of our sins, and sin is the transgression of the law, then the Ten Commandment law is God’s standard by which we will be judged.

            <p>
              For <em>all have sinned</em> and fall short of the glory of God. <cite><b>Romans 3:23</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              Wherefore, as by one man sin entered into the world, and death by sin; and so <em>death passed upon all men</em>, for that all have sinned. <cite><b>Romans 5:12, KJV</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> Because all have sinned, everyone is under condemnation before the law. If nothing is done to remedy the situation, by default, every person sits on "death row" and simply waits for the judgment.

            <p>
              <em>Repent ye therefore, and be converted, that your sins may be blotted out</em>, when the times of refreshing shall come from the presence of the Lord. <cite><b>Acts 3:19, KJV</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              Seek the Lord while He may be found, call upon Him while He is near. <em>Let the wicked forsake his way, and the unrighteous man his thoughts</em>; let him return to the Lord, and He will have mercy on him; and to our God, for <em>He will abundantly pardon</em>. <cite><b>Isaiah 55:6-7</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> Even though all have sinned, every person has hope of forgiveness! God the Father offers forgiveness to all who come to Him in repentance and forsaking of sin.

            <h2>What role does Jesus play in this?</h2>
            <p>
              But He, because He continues forever, has an unchangeable priesthood. Therefore He is also able to save to the uttermost those who come to God through Him, since <em>He always lives to make intercession for them</em>. <cite><b>Hebrews 7:24, 25</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              For we do not have a High Priest who cannot sympathize with our weaknesses, but was <em>in all points tempted as we are, yet without sin</em>. Let us therefore come boldly to the throne of grace, that we may obtain mercy and find grace to help in time of need. <cite><b>Hebrews 4:15-16</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> Because Jesus understands us and can sympathize with our weaknesses, He also intercedes on our behalf when we come to God through Him asking for forgiveness.

            <h2>What role does the Holy Spirit play?</h2>
            <p>
              Nevertheless I tell you the truth. It is to your advantage that I go away; for if I do not go away, the Helper will not come to you; but if I depart, I will send Him to you. And when He has come, <em>He will convict the world of sin</em>, and of righteousness, and of judgment. <cite><b>John 16:7, 8</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              But the Helper, the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in My name, He will teach you all things, and <em>bring to your remembrance</em> all things that I said to you. <cite><b>John 14:26</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> The Holy Spirit plays a crucial role as well by convicting us of sin and bringing to remembrance sins we have not confessed yet so there isn’t a single unconfessed sin left in our heavenly record for Satan to point to as a witness against us in the judgment.

            <h2>What happens to those whose record of sin has been removed?</h2>
            <p>
              There is therefore now <em>no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus</em>, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit. For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus hath made me free from the law of sin and death. For what the law could not do, in that it was weak through the flesh, God sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh, and for sin, condemned sin in the flesh: <em>that the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit</em>. <cite><b>Romans 8:1-4, KJV</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              He who overcomes shall be <em>clothed in white garments</em>, and I will <em>not blot out his name from the Book of Life</em>; but I will confess his name before My Father and before His angels. <cite><b>Revelation 3:5</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              Nevertheless do not rejoice in this, that the spirits are subject to you, but rather <em>rejoice because your names are written in heaven</em>. <cite><b>Luke 10:20</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> Those whose record of sin has been blotted out are no longer under condemnation because they have been forgiven through Christ, who paid the penalty for their sin on the cross and who stands before the law on their behalf with His perfect character. The law can now be fulfilled in them through the abiding presence and enabling power of the Spirit, and their names will not be blotted out from the Book of Life!

            <p>
              Now as he reasoned about righteousness, self-control, and the judgment to come, Felix was afraid and answered, “<em>Go away for now; when I have a convenient time I will call for you</em>.” <cite><b>Acts 24:25</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              For He says: “In an acceptable time I have heard you, and in the day of salvation I have helped you.” Behold, now is the accepted time; behold, <em>now is the day of salvation</em>. <cite><b>2 Corinthians 6:2</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> When the Holy Spirit convicts it is not wise to ignore it or put it off to a more convenient time because that time may never come. Tomorrow is not guaranteed; we only have today. Today is the day to get right with God.

            <h2>How does the Bible describe the law of God?</h2>
            <p>
              The works of his hands are verity and judgment; all his commandments are sure. <em>They stand fast for ever and ever</em>, and are <em>done in truth and uprightness</em>. <cite><b>Psalm 111:7, 8, KJV</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              The law of the Lord is <em>perfect</em>, converting the soul; the testimony of the Lord is <em>sure</em>, making wise the simple. The statutes of the Lord are <em>right</em>, rejoicing the heart; the commandment of the Lord is <em>pure</em>, enlightening the eyes. <cite><b>Psalm 19:7, 8</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> Every government has laws to ensure order and protection for its citizens. It is no different with the King of the universe and His government, except His law is eternal, true, upright, perfect, sure, right, and pure. God’s dominion knows no bounds, and His law, therefore, is universal as well, so even though it’s mostly neglected on Earth, it is still binding.

            <h2>Does it have a role to play in my life?</h2>
            <p>
              The fear of the Lord is clean, enduring forever; the judgments of the Lord are true and righteous altogether. More to be desired are they than gold, yea, than much fine gold; sweeter also than honey and the honeycomb. Moreover <em>by them Your servant is warned, and in keeping them there is great reward</em>. <cite><b>Psalm 19:9-11</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              And the Lord commanded us to observe all these statutes, to fear the Lord our God, <em>for our good always, that He might preserve us alive</em>, as it is this day. <cite><b>Deuteronomy 6:24</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              My son, do not forget my law, but let your heart keep my commands; <em>for length of days and long life and peace they will add to you</em>. <cite><b>Proverbs 3:1, 2</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              Fear God, and keep his commandments: for <em>this is the whole duty of man</em>. <cite><b>Ecclesiastes 12:13</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> Satan rebelled against God’s law in heaven because he didn’t want to be restricted by it, and when Adam and Even believed his lie about defining good and evil for themselves (Genesis 3:5), his lawless kingdom took over Earth as well. Our Creator God defines good and evil for us in His law because He knows what’s best for us better than we will ever know ourselves. And His law is not a restriction; it’s there to be a blessing, to protect us from evils, such as murder, adultery, theft, and falsehood, ensuring a happy and harmonious existence for all.

              If you really fulfill the royal law according to the Scripture, “You shall love your neighbor as yourself,” you do well; but <em>if you show partiality, you commit sin, and are convicted by the law as transgressors</em>. For whoever shall keep the whole law, and yet stumble in one point, <em>he is guilty of all</em>. For He who said, “Do not commit adultery,” also said, “Do not murder.” Now if you do not commit adultery, but you do murder, you have become a transgressor of the law. So speak and so do as those who <em>will be judged by the law of liberty</em>. <cite><b>James 2:8-11</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              For as many as are of the works of the law are under the curse; for it is written, “<em>Cursed is everyone who does not continue in all things which are written in the book of the law</em>, to do them.” <cite><b>Galatians 3:10</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              But we are all like an unclean thing, and <em>all our righteousnesses are like filthy rags</em>; we all fade as a leaf, and our iniquities, like the wind, have taken us away. <cite><b>Isaiah 64:6</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> When James is talking about the law, he is referring to the Ten Commandments, and he actually says it’s not enough to keep some or even most of them. Breaking even one is breaking them all! Consequently, there is no human being who hasn’t been condemned by the law, which is the standard during the judgment (see “Judgment”).

            <p>
              But that no one is justified by the law in the sight of God is evident, for “<em>the just shall live by faith</em>.” <cite><b>Galatians 3:11</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              For sin shall not have dominion over you, for <em>you are not under law but under grace</em>. <cite><b>Romans 6:14</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              Being justified freely by his grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus: whom God hath set forth to be a propitiation through faith in his blood, to declare his righteousness for the remission of sins that are past, through the forbearance of God; to declare, I say, at this time his righteousness: that he might be just, and the justifier of him which believeth in Jesus. Where is boasting then? It is excluded. By what law? of works? Nay: but by the law of faith. Therefore we conclude that a <em>man is justified by faith without the deeds of the law</em>. <cite><b>Romans 3:24-28, KJV</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> Because Jesus is the Creator God, He was able to take the condemnation of the law on Himself at the cross, on behalf of all humanity, so that every person who accepts Him by faith in His substitutionary sacrifice could stand before the law clothed in His perfectly righteous life!

            <h2>Does that mean we are now free to break it?</h2>
            <p>
              Therefore we conclude that a man is justified by faith without the deeds of the law. Is he the God of the Jews only? Is he not also of the Gentiles? Yes, of the Gentiles also: seeing it is one God, which shall justify the circumcision by faith, and uncircumcision through faith. <em>Do we then make void the law through faith? God forbid: yea, we establish the law</em>. <cite><b>Romans 3:28-31, KJV</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              What then? Shall we sin because we are not under law but under grace? <em>Certainly not</em>! <cite><b>Romans 6:15</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              Do not think that I came to destroy the Law or the Prophets. <em>I did not come to destroy but to fulfill</em>. For assuredly, I say to you, till heaven and earth pass away, one jot or one tittle will by no means pass from the law till all is fulfilled. <cite><b>Matthew 5:17, 18</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> If you were caught speeding and the police officer wanted to give you a hefty fine, but decided to give you a warning instead, would you then go screeching out back on the highway to break the speed limit again? No, you would carefully watch your speed. Jesus’ death on the cross was an act of mercy and forgiveness for those who accept it, not a license to live lawlessly.

            <h2>What does sin do?</h2>
            <p>
              Behold, the Lord’s hand is not shortened, that it cannot save; nor His ear heavy, that it cannot hear. But <em>your iniquities have separated you from your God</em>; and your sins have hidden His face from you, so that He will not hear. <cite><b>Isaiah 59:1, 2</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              <em>For the wages of sin is death</em>; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord. <cite><b>Romans 6:23, KJV</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> Sin cannot exist in the presence of a holy God because at the root of sin is selfishness, which is abhorent to God’s character of love. As a result, sin creates separation between me and God, the Giver of life, and leads to eternal death if left untreated.

            <h2>What is the motivation for keeping His law?</h2>
            <p>
              <em>If you love Me</em>, keep My commandments. <cite><b>John 14:15</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              For <em>this is the love of God, that we keep His commandments</em>. And His commandments are not burdensome. <cite><b>1 John 5:3</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              Then one of them, a lawyer, asked Him a question, testing Him, and saying, “Teacher, which is the great commandment in the law?” Jesus said to him, “‘<em>You shall love the Lord your God</em> with all your heart, with all your soul, and with all your mind.’ This is the first and great commandment. And the second is like it: ‘<em>You shall love your neighbor</em> as yourself.’ <em>On these two commandments hang all the Law</em> and the Prophets.” <cite><b>Matthew 22:35-40</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              Love does no harm to a neighbor; therefore <em>love is the fulfillment of the law</em>. <cite><b>Romans 13:10</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> Since selfishness is at the root of sin, and sin is the breaking of His law, then the law is really a law of love, dealing with my relationship with God (the first four commandments) and my neighbor (the last six). That’s why Jesus said that the entire law hangs on loving God and loving my neighbor. When there is genuine love present in a relationship then pleasing that person ceases to become a burden.

            <h2>What is one of the purposes of the law?</h2>
            <p>
              He who says, “I know Him,” and does not keep His commandments, is a liar, and the truth is not in him. But whoever keeps His word, truly the love of God is perfected in him. <em>By this we know that we are in Him</em>. <cite><b>1 John 2:4, 5</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              Not everyone who says to Me, ‘Lord, Lord,’ shall enter the kingdom of heaven, but <em>he who does the will of My Father in heaven</em>. Many will say to Me in that day, ‘Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied in Your name, cast out demons in Your name, and done many wonders in Your name?’ And then I will declare to them, ‘I never knew you; <em>depart from Me, you who practice lawlessness</em>!’ <cite><b>Matthew 7:21-23</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              The <em>heart is deceitful above all things</em>, and desperately wicked; who can know it? <em>I, the Lord, search the heart</em>, I test the mind, even to give every man according to his ways, acording to the fruit of his doings. <cite><b>Jeremiah 17:9, 10</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              O Lord, <em>You have searched me and known me</em>. You know my sitting down and my rising up; You understand my thought afar off. You comprehend my path and my lying down, and <em>are acquainted with all my ways</em>. For there is not a word on my tongue, but behold, O Lord, You know it altogether. <cite><b>Psalm 139:1-4</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> God knows me better than I know myself, and He knows if I truly love Him. The Ten Commandments are really a mirror for me that shows my genuine condition; they provide evidence letting me know if I truly love Him because it can be easy to deceive myself. Jesus says there will be people who served Him and thought they loved Him, but their lawlessness will say otherwise.

            <h2>What promise does God give me?</h2>
            <p>
              For this is the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel after those days, says the Lord: <em>I will put My laws in their mind and write them on their hearts</em>; and I will be their God, and they shall be My people. <cite><b>Hebrews 8:10</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              Then I will sprinkle clean water on you, and you shall be clean; I will cleanse you from all your filthiness and from all your idols. I will give you a new heart and put a new spirit within you; I will take the heart of stone out of your flesh and give you a heart of flesh. <em>I will put My Spirit within you and cause you to walk in My statutes, and you will keep My judgments and do them</em>. <cite><b>Ezekiel 36:25-27</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              Until now you have asked nothing in My name. <em>Ask, and you will receive, that your joy may be full</em>. <cite><b>John 16:34</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              <em>I delight to do Your will</em>, O my God, and <em>Your law is within my heart</em>. <cite><b>Psalm 40:8</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> God promises to help me keep His commandments because He knows that I cannot overcome sin myself. But He does not force Himself on anyone, so I must ask, and the promise is He will write His law on my heart and mind, enabling me to walk in His commandments through the power of the Holy Spirit dwelling in me! Jesus does all the heavy lifting for me; I just have to cooperate with Him. That’s why the Psalmist was able to say he delighted to do God’s will because God wrote the law in his heart!

            <p>
              <em>First:</em> I am the Lord your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage. You shall have no other gods before Me. <cite><b>Exodus 20:2, 3</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              <em>Second:</em> You shall not make for yourself a carved image&mdash;any likeness of anything that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath, or that is in the water under the earth; you shall not bow down to them nor serve them. For I, the Lord your God, am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children to the third and fourth generations of those who hate Me, but showing mercy to thousands, to those who love Me and keep My commandments. <cite><b>Exodus 20:4-6</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              <em>Third:</em> You shall not take the name of the Lord your God in vain, for the Lord will not hold him guiltless who takes His name in vain. <cite><b>Exodus 20:7</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              <em>Fourth:</em> Remember the Sabbath day, to keep it holy. Six days you shall labor and do all your work, but the seventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord your God. In it you shall do no work: you, nor your son, nor your daughter, nor your male servant, nor your female servant, nor your cattle, nor your stranger who is within your gates. For in six days the Lord made the heavens and the earth, the sea, and all that is in them, and rested the seventh day. Therefore the Lord blessed the Sabbath day and hallowed it. <cite><b>Exodus 20:8-11</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              <em>Fifth:</em> Honor your father and your mother, that your days may be long upon the land which the Lord your God is giving you. <cite><b>Exodus 20:12</b></cite>

            <h2>How does the devil feel about keeping God’s law?</h2>
            <p>
              And <em>the dragon was enraged</em> with the woman, and he went to make war with the rest of her offspring, <em>who keep the commandments of God</em> and have the testimony of Jesus Christ. <cite><b>Revelation 12:17</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              He answered and said to them, “<em>Why do you also transgress the commandment of God because of your tradition</em>? ... Thus you have made the commandment of God of no effect by your tradition. Hypocrites! Well did Isaiah prophesy about you, saying: ‘These people draw near to Me with their mouth, and honor Me with their lips, but their heart is far from Me. And <em>in vain they worship Me, teaching as doctrines the commandments of men</em>.’” <cite><b>Matthew 15:3, 6-9</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              It is time for You to act, O Lord, for <em>they have regarded Your law as void</em>. <cite><b>Psalm 119:126</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> The devil’s war against God and His law started in the courts of heaven and has been raging ever since here on Earth. Is it any surprise that the devil would try to persuade people that God's law is no longer binding and even go as far as persecuting those who keep it?

            <p>
              Then I saw another angel flying in the midst of heaven, having the everlasting gospel to preach to those who dwell on the earth&mdash;to every nation, tribe, tongue, and people&mdash;saying with a loud voice, “Fear God and give glory to Him, for the hour of His judgment has come; and <em>worship Him who made heaven and earth, the sea and springs of water</em>.” <cite><b>Revelation 14:6, 7</b></cite>

              For by him [Jesus] were all things created, that are in heaven, and that are in earth, visible and invisible, whether they be thrones, or dominions, or principalities, or powers: <em>all things were created by him, and for him</em>: and he is before all things, and <em>by him all things consist</em>. <cite><b>Colossians 1:16, 17</b></cite>

            <h2>Which commandment identifies the Creator God?</h2>
            <p>
              Remember the Sabbath day, to keep it holy. Six days you shall labor and do all your work, but the seventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord your God. In it you shall do no work: you, nor your son, nor your daughter, nor your male servant, nor your female servant, nor your cattle, nor your stranger who is within your gates. <em>For in six days the Lord made the heavens and the earth, the sea, and all that is in them, and rested the seventh day</em>. Therefore the Lord blessed the Sabbath day and hallowed it. <cite><b>Exodus 20:8-11</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> The fourth commandment begins with the word “remember” because God knew His Sabbath would be forgotten. It also identifies God as the Creator of everything, and every created being is invited to show his or her acknowledgment of this by resting on the Sabbath day, just like He rested on the seventh day as an example for us.

            <h2>What else can I learn about the Sabbath from Genesis 2?</h2>
            <p>
              Thus the heavens and the earth, and all the host of them, were finished. And on the seventh day God ended His work which He had done, and He rested on the seventh day from all His work which He had done. Then <em>God blessed the seventh day and sanctified it</em>, because in it He rested from all His work which God had created and made. <cite><b>Genesis 2:1-3</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> The reason why the fourth commandment invites me to keep the Sabbath day holy is because God blessed this specific day and sanctified it. The word used in the original text is “qadash,” which means “to be set apart or consecrated.” In other words, the seventh day is special to God and unlike any of the other six days of the week.

Hallow My Sabbaths, and they will be a sign between Me and you, that you may <em>know that I am the Lord your God</em>. <cite><b>Ezekiel 20:12, 20</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> The Sabbath is a sign of my acknowledgment that 1) God is Lord of the universe because He created it in six literal days (Exodus 20:8, 11) and 2) He is Lord of my life because He’s the One who redeems and sanctifies me.

            <p>
              So He came to Nazareth, where He had been brought up. And <em>as His custom was, He went into the synagogue on the Sabbath day</em>, and stood up to read. <cite><b>Luke 4:16</b></cite>

            <p>
              That day was the Preparation, and <em>the Sabbath drew near</em>. And the women who had come with Him from Galilee followed after, and they observed the tomb and how His body was laid. Then they returned and prepared spices and fragrant oils. And <em>they rested on the Sabbath according to the commandment</em>. <cite><b>Luke 23:54-56</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              Now <em>on the first day of the week</em>, very early in the morning, they, and certain other women with them, <em>came to the tomb</em> bringing the spices which they had prepared. <cite><b>Luke 24:1</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> The Bible is clear that His followers kept the Sabbath. In fact, they even stopped their work of anointing His body in order to keep it according to the commandment. They ended up coming back on Sunday, the first day of the week, after the Sabbath was over, to finish their work.

            <p>
              So when the Jews went out of the synagogue, the <em>Gentiles begged that these words might be preached to them the next Sabbath</em>. Now when the congregation had broken up, many of the Jews and devout proselytes followed Paul and Barnabas, who, speaking to them, persuaded them to continue in the grace of God. <em>On the next Sabbath almost the whole city came together to hear the word of God</em>. <cite><b>Acts 13:42-44</b></cite>

              <b>Note:</b> God is Lord of the Sabbath, which is Saturday, the seventh day (Exodus 8:11). Notice that He calls these days “My Sabbaths,” meaning it’s His special day that He blessed and sanctified to be a sign between Him and me of His creative, redeeming, and sanctifying power! The Sabbath is a day of rest from works, and as such, it is a beautiful symbol of righteousness by faith as we are saved by the righteousness of Jesus, not our works.

            <p>
              Wherefore the children of Israel shall keep the sabbath, to observe the sabbath throughout their generations, for a <em>perpetual covenant</em>. It is a sign between me and the children of Israel <em>for ever</em>: for in six days the LORD made heaven and earth, and on the seventh day he rested, and was refreshed. And he gave unto Moses, when he had made an end of communing with him upon mount Sinai, two tables of testimony, <em>tables of stone</em>, written with the finger of God. <cite><b>Exodus 31:16-18</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> The Ten Commandments, which the Sabbath is a part of, were written by the finger of God on tablets of stone, instead of a material subject to decay, like wood or clay, as a testament to their timelessness. This is in contrast to Jesus writing the sins of the woman caught in adultery in the dust (John 8:1-11), as a beautiful testament to God’s willingness to forgive anyone who repents.

            <p>
              For he spake in a certain place of the seventh day on this wise, and God did rest the seventh day from all his works. And in this place again, If they shall enter into my rest. Seeing therefore it remaineth that some must enter therein, and <em>they to whom it was first preached entered not in because of unbelief</em> ... There remaineth therefore a rest to the people of God. For he that is entered into his rest, he also hath ceased from his own works, as God did from his. <em>Let us labour therefore to enter into that rest, lest any man fall after the same example of unbelief</em>. <cite><b>Hebrews 4:4-6, 9-11</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> The book of Hebrews says there was unbelief about resting on the seventh day, but to deny this day is to deny salvation by faith. Because I cannot sanctify myself, I am invited to cease from trying to be saved by my own works and rest in the righteous life of Jesus on my behalf. Resting on the seventh day of the week, as God did in Genesis 2, is an acknowledgment of this sublime truth.

            <h2>What happened as the Sabbath approached after Jesus died?</h2>
            <p>
              And that day was the preparation, and the sabbath drew on. And the women also, which came with him from Galilee, followed after, and beheld the sepulchre, and how his body was laid. And they returned, and prepared spices and ointments; and <em>rested the sabbath day according to the commandment</em>. <cite><b>Luke 23:54-56</b></cite>

            <h2>What happened once the Sabbath was over?</h2>
            <p>
              Now upon the <em>first day of the week</em>, very early in the morning, <em>they came unto the sepulchre</em>, bringing the spices which they had prepared, and certain others with them. <cite><b>Luke 24:1</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              In the end of the sabbath, as it began to dawn toward the <em>first day of the week, came Mary Magdalene and the other Mary to see the sepulchre</em>. <cite><b>Matthew 28:1</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              And very early in the morning the <em>first day of the week, they came unto the sepulchre</em> at the rising of the sun. <cite><b>Mark 16:2</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              The <em>first day of the week cometh Mary Magdalene early, when it was yet dark, unto the sepulchre</em>, and seeth the stone taken away from the sepulchre. <cite><b>John 20:1</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              Now when Jesus was risen early the <em>first day of the week, he appeared first to Mary Magdalene</em>, out of whom he had cast seven devils. <cite><b>Mark 16:9</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> Jesus’ followers were so concerned about the Sabbath that they even stopped their labor of love in preparing His body for burial, kept the Sabbath, and returned to resume their unfinished work early Sunday morning. Notice there is no mention of them keeping the first day, Sunday, holy in honor of Jesus’ resurrection, nor is there a command by Jesus to do so. When He appeared to Mary Magdalene that morning there was no talk of Sunday keeping at all.

            <h2>What was instituted in honor of Jesus’ resurrection?</h2>
            <p>
              Know ye not, that so many of us as were baptized into Jesus Christ were baptized into his death? Therefore <em>we are buried with him by baptism into death: that like as Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the Father, even so we also should walk in newness of life</em>. For if we have been planted together in the likeness of his death, we shall be also in the likeness of his resurrection: knowing this, <em>that our old man is crucified with him, that the body of sin might be destroyed, that henceforth we should not serve sin</em>. <cite><b>Romans 6:3-5</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> Jesus instituted baptism in honor of His resurrection, which serves as a symbol of death to sin and the start of a new life in and for Christ.

            <h2>Didn’t the disciples break bread on the first day?</h2>
            <p>
              And upon the <em>first day of the week, when the disciples came together to break bread</em>, Paul preached unto them, ready to depart on the morrow; and continued his speech until midnight. <cite><b>Acts 20:7</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              And they, <em>continuing daily with one accord in the temple, and breaking bread from house to house</em>, did eat their meat with gladness and singleness of heart. <cite><b>Acts 2:46</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> There is no significance to the breaking of bread in Acts 20:7 because in Acts 2:46 we learn that the early Christians broke break daily. Nothing in these passages indicates that they considered the first day holy. The meeting in Acts 20:7 was taking place because Paul was leaving the next day.

            <p>
              Then the same day at evening, <em>being the first day of the week</em>, when the doors were shut where the disciples were assembled for fear of the Jews, <em>came Jesus and stood in the midst</em>, and saith unto them, Peace be unto you. And when he had so said, he shewed unto them his hands and his side. Then were the disciples glad, when they saw the Lord. Then said Jesus to them again, Peace be unto you: as my Father hath sent me, even so send I you. <cite><b>John 20:19-21</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> Here Jesus appears to His disciples in person, but once again, He makes no mention of the need to gather together on Sunday in honor of His resurrection.

            <h2>What about 1 Corinthians 16:2?</h2>
            <p>
              Now concerning the collection for the saints, as I have given order to the churches of Galatia, even so do ye. Upon the <em>first day of the week let every one of you lay by him in store</em>, as God hath prospered him, that there be no gatherings when I come. And when I come, whomsoever ye shall approve by your letters, them will I send to bring your liberality unto Jerusalem. <cite><b>1 Corinthians 16:1-3</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> Here Paul is asking each person to put money aside for the needy, privately, once the Sabbath is over, so it would be ready when he comes. There is no mention of Sunday as a holy day.

            <h2>What did Jesus say about the law?</h2>
            <p>
              Think not that I am come to destroy the law, or the prophets: <em>I am not come to destroy, but to fulfil</em>. For verily I say unto you, till heaven and earth pass, <em>one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law</em>, till all be fulfilled. <cite><b>Matthew 5:17, 18</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> There are no verses in the Bible of Jesus changing the fourth commandment to mean observing Sunday instead of Saturday, nor did He tell others to do so later on. On the contrary, His mission was to fulfill the law, to uphold and expand it beyond the “letter” of the law to include the “spirit” of the law, as well. (For example, He expanded the sin of adultery to also include lust of the heart, see Matthew 5:28.)

            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> It was a heart filled with love for His Father that enabled Jesus to fulfill the law in His life.

            <p>
              That the righteousness of the law <em>might be fulfilled in us</em>, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit. <cite><b>Romans 8:4</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              <em>Ask, and it shall be given you</em>; seek, and ye shall find; knock, and it shall be opened unto you: <em>For every one that asketh receiveth</em>; and he that seeketh findeth; and to him that knocketh it shall be opened. <cite><b>Matthew 7:7, 8</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> If my heart is actuated by love for Jesus and filled with the Holy Spirit then the law can be fulfilled in my life too. I just have to ask Him.
