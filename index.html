            <h2>1. How much of the Bible is inspired and by whom? For what purpose?</h2>
            <p>
              <em>All</em> Scripture is given by inspiration of <em>God</em>, and is profitable <em>for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness</em>, that the man of God may be complete, thoroughly equipped for every good work. <cite><span>2 Timothy 3:16, 17</span></cite>
            </p>
          </section>
          <section>
            <h2>2. How did it maintain its miraculous unity?</h2>
            <p>
              Knowing this first, that no prophecy of Scripture is of any private interpretation, for prophecy never came by the will of man, but holy men of God spoke as they were moved by the <em>Holy Spirit</em>. <cite><span>2 Peter 1:20, 21</span></cite>
            </p>
          </section>
          <section>
            <h2>3. Can the Bible be trusted?</h2>
            <p>
              The entirety of Your word is <em>truth</em>, and every one of Your righteous judgments endures forever. <cite><span>Psalm 119:160</span></cite>
            </p>
          </section>
          <section>
            <h2>4. But hasn’t it been corrupted over the ages?</h2>
            <p>
              The words of the Lord are <em>pure words</em>, like silver tried in a furnace of earth, purified seven times. You shall keep them, O Lord, You shall <em>preserve them</em> from this generation forever. <cite><span>Psalm 12:6, 7</span></cite>
            </p>
          </section>
          <section>
            <h2>5. Can God’s Words be changed or done away with?</h2>
            <p>
              Heaven and earth will pass away, but <em>My words will by no means pass away</em>. <cite><span>Matthew 24:35</span></cite>
            </p>
          </section>
          <section>
            <h2>6. What’s one of the reasons God gave us the Scriptures?</h2>
            <p>
              For whatever things were written before were written for our learning, that we through the patience and comfort of the Scriptures might <em>have hope</em>. <cite><span>Romans 15:4</span></cite>
            </p>
          </section>
          <section>
            <h2>7. What is another important reason?</h2>
            <p>
              And that from childhood you have known the Holy Scriptures, which are able to make you wise for <em>salvation</em> through faith which is in Christ Jesus. <cite><span>2 Timothy 3:15</span></cite>
            </p>
          </section>
          <section>
            <h2>8. Who do the Scriptures point us to?</h2>
            <p>
              You search the Scriptures, for in them you think you have eternal life; and these are they which <em>testify of Me</em>. <cite><span>John 5:39</span></cite>
            </p>
          </section>
          <section>
            <h2>9. What should we do with the Bible?</h2>
            <p>
              <em>Study</em> to shew thyself approved unto God, a workman that needeth not to be ashamed, rightly dividing the word of truth. <cite><span>2 Timothy 2:15, KJV</span></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              These were more noble than those in Thessalonica, in that they received the word with all readiness of mind, and <em>searched the scriptures daily</em>, whether those things were so. <cite><span>Acts 17:11, KJV</span></cite>
            </p>
          </section>
          <section>
            <h2>10. Could God’s Word be as important as physical food?</h2>
            <p>
              Man shall not live by bread alone, but by <em>every word that proceeds from the mouth of God</em>. <cite><span>Matthew 4:4</span></cite>
            </p>
          </section>
          <section>
            <h2>11. Are we promised any help when studying the Bible?</h2>
            <p>
              However, when He, the Spirit of truth, has come, <em>He will guide you into all truth</em>; for He will not speak on His own authority, but whatever He hears He will speak; and He will tell you things to come. <cite><span>John 16:13</span></cite>
            </p>
          </section>
          <section>
            <h2>12. Why should we ask for the Holy Spirit’s guidance?</h2>
            <p>
              These things we also speak, not in words which man’s wisdom teaches but which the Holy Spirit teaches, comparing spiritual things with spiritual. But the natural man does not receive the things of the Spirit of God, for they are foolishness to him; nor can he know them, because they are <em>spiritually discerned</em>. <cite><span>1 Corinthians 2:13</span></cite>
            </p>
          </section>
          <section>
            <h2>13. How should we study the Bible?</h2>
            <p>
              Whom will he teach knowledge? And whom will he make to understand the message? Those just weaned from milk? Those just drawn from the breasts? For precept must be upon precept, <em>precept upon precept, line upon line</em>, line upon line, <em>here a little, there a little</em>. <cite><span>Isaiah 28:9, 10</span></cite>
            </p>
          </section>
          <section>
            <h2>14. What does the truth in God’s Word do to us?</h2>
            <p>
              <em>Sanctify them</em> through thy truth: thy word is truth. <cite><span>John 17:17, KJV</span></cite>
            </p>
          </section>
          <section>
            <h2>15. If I’m willing to follow God’s will, what promise do I have?</h2>
            <p>
              If anyone wills to do His will, <em>he shall know concerning the doctrine</em>, whether it is from God or whether I speak on My own authority. <cite><span>John 7:17</span></cite>

The workmanship of your timbrels and pipes was prepared for you on the day you were created. You were the anointed cherub who covers; I established you; you were on the holy mountain of God; you walked back and forth in the midst of fiery stones. <em>You were perfect in your ways from the day you were created, till iniquity was found in you</em>. <cite><span>Ezekiel 28:12-15</span></cite>

Then God blessed them, and God said to them, “Be fruitful and multiply; fill the earth and subdue it; have dominion over the fish of the sea, over the birds of the air, and over every living thing that moves on the earth.” And God said, “See, I have given you every herb that yields seed which is on the face of all the earth, and every tree whose fruit yields seed; to you it shall be for food. Also, to every beast of the earth, to every bird of the air, and to everything that creeps on the earth, in which there is life, I have given every green herb for food”; and it was so.

For God knows that in the day you eat of it your eyes will be opened, and you will be like God, knowing good and evil.” So when the woman saw that the tree was good for food, that it was pleasant to the eyes, and a tree desirable to make one wise, <em>she took of its fruit and ate</em>. She also gave to her husband with her, and he ate. Then the eyes of both of them were opened, and they knew that they were naked; and they sewed fig leaves together and made themselves coverings. <cite><span>Genesis 3:1-7</span></cite>

              Inasmuch then as the children have partaken of flesh and blood, He Himself likewise shared in the same, that <em>through death He might destroy him who had the power of death</em>, that is, the devil, and release those who through fear of death were all their lifetime subject to bondage. For indeed He does not give aid to angels, but He does give aid to the seed of Abraham. Therefore, in all things He had to be made like His brethren, that He might be a merciful and faithful High Priest in things pertaining to God, <em>to make propitiation for the sins of the people</em>. <cite><span>Hebrews 2:14-17</span></cite>

              For if by the one man’s offense death reigned through the one, much more those who receive abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness will reign in life through the One, Jesus Christ. Therefore, as through one man’s offense judgment came to all men, resulting in condemnation, even so through one Man’s righteous act <em>the free gift came to all men, resulting in justification of life</em>. For as by one man’s disobedience many were made sinners, so also <em>by one Man’s obedience many will be made righteous</em>. <cite><span>Romans 5:17-19</span></cite>

              Now I saw <em>a new heaven and a new earth</em>, for the first heaven and the first earth had passed away. Also there was no more sea. Then I, John, saw the holy city, New Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband. And I heard a loud voice from heaven saying, “Behold, the tabernacle of God is with men, and He will dwell with them, and they shall be His people. <em>God Himself will be with them and be their God</em>. And God will wipe away every tear from their eyes; there shall be <em>no more death, nor sorrow, nor crying</em>. There shall be <em>no more pain, for the former things have passed away</em>.” Then He who sat on the throne said, “Behold, I make all things new.” And He said to me, “Write, for these words are true and faithful.” <cite><span>Revelation 21:1-5</span></cite>
