            <h2>How much of the Bible is inspired by God? For what purpose?</h2>
            <p>
              <em>All</em> Scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable <em>for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness</em>, that the man of God may be perfect, throughly furnished unto all good works. <cite><b>2 Timothy 3:16, 17</b></cite>
            </p>
          </section>
          <section>
            <div>2</div>
            <h2>How did it maintain its miraculous unity?</h2>
            <p>
              Knowing this first, that no prophecy of the scripture is of any private interpretation. For the prophecy came not in old time by the will of man: but holy men of God spake <em>as they were moved by the Holy Ghost</em>. <cite><b>2 Peter 1:20, 21</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> The Bible was written over a period of 1,500 years by about 40 different authors whose education and background varied greatly. The Bible’s unity under these circumstances is astonishing and can only be explained by divine inspiration.

            <h2>Can the Bible be trusted?</h2>
            <p>
              <em>Thy word is true from the beginning</em>, and every one of thy righteous judgments endureth for ever. <cite><b>Psalm 119:160</b></cite>
            </p>
          </section>
          <section>
            <div>4</div>
            <h2>But hasn’t it been corrupted over the ages?</h2>
            <p>

              The words of the LORD are <em>pure words</em>, as silver tried in a furnace of earth, purified seven times. Thou shalt keep them, O LORD, thou shalt <em>preserve them</em> from this generation for ever. <cite><b>Psalm 12:6, 7</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> God’s word is truth, and He will ensure it stays that way.

            <div>5</div>
            <h2>Can God’s Word be changed or done away with?</h2>
            <p>
              Heaven and earth shall pass away, but <em>my words shall not pass away</em>. <cite><b>Matthew 24:35</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              For all flesh is as grass, and all the glory of man as the flower of grass. The grass withereth, and the flower thereof falleth away: but <em>the word of the LORD endureth for ever</em>. And this is the word which by the gospel is preached unto you. <cite><b>1 Peter 1:24, 25</b></cite>
            </p>
          </section>

            <h2>Why did God give us the Scriptures?</h2>
            <p>
              For whatsoever things were written aforetime were written <em>for our learning</em>, that we through patience and comfort of the scriptures <em>might have hope</em>. <cite><b>Romans 15:4</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              For this is good and acceptable in the sight of God our Savior, <em>who will have all men to be saved, and to come unto the knowledge of the truth</em>. <cite><b>1 Timothy 2:3, 4</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              And that from a child thou hast known the holy scriptures, which are able <em>to make thee wise unto salvation</em> through faith which is in Christ Jesus. <cite><b>2 Timothy 3:15</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> God gave us the Scriptures so we can learn about His character and be grounded in His truth while navigating a world of deception, so that through it we might be saved from sin and have hope of eternal life.

            <div>7</div>
            <h2>Who do the Scriptures point me to?</h2>
            <p>
              Search the scriptures; for in them ye think ye have eternal life: and they are they which <em>testify of me</em>. <cite><b>John 5:39</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              Looking unto Jesus the <em>author and finisher of our faith</em>; who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross, despising the shame, and is set down at the right hand of the throne of God. <cite><b>Hebrews 12:2</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              Jesus saith unto him, <em>I am the way, the truth, and the life</em>: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me. <cite><b>John 14:6</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> All the stories of the Bible point me to Jesus, the Author and Finisher of my faith.

            <h2>How can I be blessed by the Bible?</h2>
            <p>
              <em>Study</em> to shew thyself approved unto God, a workman that needeth not to be ashamed, rightly dividing the word of truth. <cite><b>2 Timothy 2:15</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              These were more noble than those in Thessalonica, in that they received the word with all readiness of mind, and <em>searched the scriptures daily</em>, whether those things were so. <cite><b>Acts 17:11</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> The Bible is unlike any other book because it is my Creator and Redeemer’s special gift to me. He speaks to me through it, and it is my privilege to read it daily because by doing so I’ll draw closer to Him. Every relationship is built on spending quality time together, and my relationship with Jesus is no different.

            <h2>Is God’s Word as important as physical food?</h2>
            <p>
              But he answered and said, It is written, Man shall not live by bread alone, but by <em>every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God</em>. <cite><b>Matthew 4:4</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              Neither have I gone back from the commandment of his lips; I have esteemed the words of his mouth <em>more than my necessary food</em>. <cite><b>Job 23:12</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that believeth on me hath everlasting life. <em>I am that bread of life</em>. Your fathers did eat manna in the wilderness, and are dead. This is the bread which cometh down from heaven, that a man may eat thereof, and not die. I am the living bread which came down from heaven: <em>if any man eat of this bread, he shall live for ever</em>: and the bread that I will give is my flesh, which I will give for the life of the world. <cite><b>John 6:47-51</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> Jesus is the spiritual bread that brings everlasting life, and we “eat” it whenever we read His Word. Our need for Him is actually greater than our need for physical food.

            <div>10</div>
            <h2>Who did Jesus say will help me understand the Bible?</h2>
            <p>
              Howbeit when he, <em>the Spirit of truth</em>, is come, he <em>will guide you into all truth</em>: for he shall not speak of himself; but whatsoever he shall hear, that shall he speak: and he will shew you things to come. <cite><b>John 16:13</b></cite>
            </p>
          </section>
          <section>
            <div>11</div>
            <h2>Why should I ask for the Holy Spirit’s guidance?</h2>
            <p>
              Which things also we speak, not in the words which man's wisdom teacheth, but which the Holy Ghost teacheth; comparing spiritual things with spiritual. But the natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God: for they are foolishness unto him: neither can he know them, <em>because they are spiritually discerned</em>. <cite><b>1 Corinthians 2:13, 14</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> Because spiritual things are spiritually discerned and because the Bible is full of stories with symbolism, I need the Holy Spirit to open my spiritual eyes and help me bring these stories to life. Humility and a teachable attitude is also a crucial part of it.
            </p>

          <section>
            <div>12</div>
            <h2>How should I study the Bible?</h2>
            <p>
              Whom shall he teach knowledge? and whom shall he make to understand doctrine? them that are weaned from the milk, and drawn from the breasts. For precept must be upon precept, <em>precept upon precept; line upon line</em>, line upon line; <em>here a little, and there a little</em>. <cite><b>Isaiah 28:9, 10</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> God is not a God of contradiction or confusion, so it’s important to not take verses out of context and build a doctrine based on a verse or two. When studying a particular topic, it’s critical to identify as many verses as possible dealing with the topic and to let the Bible clarify itself on what seem, due to our misunderstanding, like contradictory ones.
            </p>
          </section>
          <section>
            <div>13</div>
            <h2>What will the truth in God’s Word do to me?</h2>
            <p>
              <em>Sanctify them</em> through thy truth: thy word is truth. <cite><b>John 17:17</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              But we all, with open face <em>beholding as in a glass the glory of the LORD, are changed into the same image</em> from glory to glory, even as by the Spirit of the LORD. <cite><b>2 Corinthians 3:18</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              For <em>the word of God is living and powerful</em>, and sharper than any two-edged sword, piercing even to the division of soul and spirit, and of joints and marrow, and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart. <cite><b>Hebrews 4:12, NKJV</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> Reading the Bible brings me into contact with God’s divine mind and holy character, and by beholding it daily, I become more like Him through the work of the Holy Spirit. There is a reason the book of Hebrews calls the word of God living and powerful!

            <p>
              If anyone wills to do His will, <em>he shall know concerning the doctrine</em>, whether it is from God or whether I speak on My own authority. <cite><b>John 7:17, NKJV</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> If I’m willing to follow it, the promise is God will reveal His truth to me.

            </p>
            <p>
              I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the ending, saith the LORD, <em>which is, and which was, and which is to come</em>, the Almighty. <cite><b>Revelation 1:8</b></cite>

            </p>

            <p>
              Remember the former things of old: for I am God, and there is none else; I am God, and there is none like me, <em>declaring the end from the beginning</em>, and from ancient times the things that are not yet done, saying, My counsel shall stand, and I will do all my pleasure. <cite><b>Isaiah 46:9, 10</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              My frame was not hidden from You, when I was made in secret, and skillfully wrought in the lowest parts of the earth. Your eyes saw my substance, being yet unformed. And <em>in Your book they all were written, the days fashioned for me, when as yet there were none of them</em>. <cite><b>Psalm 139:15, 16, NKJV</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              Surely the Lord GOD will do nothing, but <em>he revealeth his secret unto his servants the prophets</em>. <cite><b>Amos 3:7</b></cite>

            <p class="note">

But when the blade was sprung up, and brought forth fruit, then appeared the tares also. So the servants of the householder came and said unto him, Sir, didst not thou sow good seed in thy field? from whence then hath it tares? He said unto them, <em>An enemy hath done this</em>. <cite><b>Matthew 13:24-28</b></cite>

            <p>
              Thou sealest up the sum, full of wisdom, and perfect in beauty. Thou hast been in Eden the garden of God; every precious stone was thy covering, the sardius, topaz, and the diamond, the beryl, the onyx, and the jasper, the sapphire, the emerald, and the carbuncle, and gold: the workmanship of thy tabrets and of thy pipes was prepared in thee in the day that thou wast created. <em>Thou art the anointed cherub that covereth</em>; and I have set thee so: thou wast upon the holy mountain of God; thou hast walked up and down in the midst of the stones of fire. <em>Thou wast perfect in thy ways from the day that thou wast created, till iniquity was found in thee</em>. <cite><b>Ezekiel 28:12-15</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              The Lord reigneth; let the people tremble: <em>he sitteth between the cherubims</em>; let the earth be moved. <cite><b>Psalm 99:1</b></cite>

            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> In Ezekiel 28 Lucifer is symbolized as the “prince of Tyre,” and we learn that he was created perfect. He was also a covering cherub, which means he had a high position in heaven and was next to God’s very presence. It’s unknown how long perfection existed in heaven, but eventually evil was born in Lucifer’s heart because he aall of God’s angels had freedom of choice. This is a risk God willingly took because genuine love cannot exist without a free will.

            <p>
              How art thou fallen from heaven, O Lucifer, son of the morning! how art thou cut down to the ground, which didst weaken the nations!

            <p>
              So <em>God created man in his own image</em>, in the image of God created he him; male and female created he them. And God blessed them, and God said unto them, <em>Be fruitful, and multiply</em>, and replenish the earth, and subdue it: and have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth.
              <br><br>
              And God said, Behold, I have given you every herb bearing seed, which is upon the face of all the earth, and every tree, in the which is the fruit of a tree yielding seed; to you it shall be for meat. And to every beast of the earth, and to every fowl of the air, and to every thing that creepeth upon the earth, wherein there is life, I have given every green herb for meat: and it was so. And God saw every thing that he had made, and, behold, <em>it was very good</em>. And the evening and the morning were the sixth day. <cite><b>Genesis 1:27-31</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              And the LORD God took the man, and put him into the garden of Eden to dress it and to keep it. And the LORD God commanded the man, saying, Of every tree of the garden thou mayest freely eat: But <em>of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not eat of it</em>: for in the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die. <cite><b>Genesis 2:15-17</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> After losing some of His angels, God created a new order of beings after His own image. Adam and Eve were to be independent judges between the government of God and that of Satan since they did not witness the conflict in heaven. God gave them a perfect start, everything they needed for happiness and prosperity, but like His angels, they also had free will, and in order to be fair to Satan, God gave him access to them at the tree.

            <p>
              Now the serpent was more subtil than any beast of the field which the LORD God had made. And he said unto the woman, Yea, hath God said, Ye shall not eat of every tree of the garden? And the woman said unto the serpent, We may eat of the fruit of the trees of the garden: But of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden, God hath said, Ye shall not eat of it, neither shall ye touch it, lest ye die. And the serpent said unto the woman, Ye shall not surely die: For God doth know that in the day ye eat thereof, then <em>your eyes shall be opened, and ye shall be as gods, knowing good and evil</em>. <cite><b>Genesis 3:1-5</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> Satan used a serpent to deceive Eve and contradict God by telling her that not only would she not die if she ate the fruit, but she would also become like God, which is exactly what Satan himself desired in heaven. The implication was that God was holding her back from reaching her fullest potential, and Satan was actually the one who had her best interests in mind, not God.

            <p>
              And when the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that it was pleasant to the eyes, and a tree to be desired to make one wise, she took of the fruit thereof, and did eat, and gave also unto her husband with her; and he did eat. And <em>the eyes of them both were opened, and they knew that they were naked</em>; and they sewed fig leaves together, and made themselves aprons. <cite><b>Genesis 3:6-7</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> In order to deceive Eve, Satan mixed in some truth with his lie when he said she would know good and evil because now that they had sinned against God, Adam and Eve lost their innocence, and their eyes were indeed opened to shame, grief, suffering, pain, and death, but they did not ascend to a higher state of existence, as Satan had promised. It was not God’s will for them to know evil, but because Adam and Eve had chosen to believe Satan’s version of reality, he was now free to proceed with establishing his form of government on Earth.

            </p>
            <p>
              Behold, the LORD'S hand is not shortened, that it cannot save; neither his ear heavy, that it cannot hear: But <em>your iniquities have separated between you and your God</em>, and your sins have hid his face from you, that he will not hear. <cite><b>Isaiah 59:1, 2</b></cite>

            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> As soon as Adam and Eve sinned, they hid from God for the first time.

              And I will put enmity between you and the woman, and between your seed and her Seed; <em>He shall bruise your head</em>, and you shall bruise His heel. <cite><b>Genesis 3:15, NKJV</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              Forasmuch then as the children are partakers of flesh and blood, he also himself likewise took part of the same; that <em>through death he might destroy him that had the power of death</em>, that is, the devil; And <em>deliver them who through fear of death were all their lifetime subject to bondage</em>. For verily he took not on him the nature of angels; but he took on him the seed of Abraham.Wherefore in all things it behoved him to be made like unto his brethren, that he might be a merciful and faithful high priest in things pertaining to God, <em>to make reconciliation for the sins of the people</em>. <cite><b>Hebrews 2:14-17</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> Once Adam and Eve fell, God did not leave them in their hopeless condition but gave them a promise that sin would not reign on earth forever. A Redeemer would come who would crush the head of Satan and break the power of sin and death over the human race by paying for their sins Himself.

            <h2>How can I go from death to justification of life?</h2>
            <p>
              For if by one man's offence death reigned by one; much more <em>they which receive abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness shall reign in life by one, Jesus Christ</em>. Therefore as by the offence of one judgment came upon all men to condemnation; even so by the righteousness of one the <em>free gift came upon all men unto justification of life</em>. For as by one man's disobedience many were made sinners, so <em>by the obedience of one shall many be made righteous</em>. <cite><b>Romans 5:17-19</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              Being justified freely by his grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus: Whom God hath set forth to be a propitiation through faith in his blood, <em>to declare his righteousness for the remission of sins</em> that are past, through the forbearance of God. <cite><b>Romans 3:24, 25</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> Christ’s perfect life gives us the ability to be free from the bondage of sin and it’s penalty of death! By paying for our sins, Jesus made it possible for anyone who receives this free gift by faith through repentance of sins to be forgiven and declared righteous before God!

Wherefore God also hath highly exalted him, and given him a name which is above every name: that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of things in heaven, and things in earth, and things under the earth; and that <em>every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord</em>, to the glory of God the Father.

And <em>God blessed them</em>, and God said unto them, Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it: and have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth. And God said, Behold, I have given you every herb bearing seed, which is upon the face of all the earth, and every tree, in the which is the fruit of a tree yielding seed; to you it shall be for meat. And to every beast of the earth, and to every fowl of the air, and to every thing that creepeth upon the earth, wherein there is life, I have given every green herb for meat: and it was so. And <em>God saw every thing that he had made, and, behold, it was very good</em>. And the evening and the morning were the sixth day. <cite><b>Genesis 1:27-31</b></cite>

              <b>Note:</b> Sin started the process of decay and death on the earth that would affect not just Adam and Eve, but every other living thing on it.

            <h2>What role does choice play in salvation?</h2>
            <p>
              And if it seem evil unto you to serve the LORD, <em>choose you this day whom ye will serve</em>; whether the gods which your fathers served that were on the other side of the flood, or the gods of the Amorites, in whose land ye dwell: but as for me and my house, we will serve the LORD. <cite><b>Joshua 24:15</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              I call heaven and earth to record this day against you, that I have set before you life and death, blessing and cursing: <em>therefore choose life</em>, that both thou and thy seed may live. <cite><b>Deuteronomy 30:19</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              Behold, I stand at the door, and knock: <em>if any man hear my voice, and open the door</em>, I will come in to him, and will sup with him, and he with me. <cite><b>Revelation 3:20</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> God’s way of salvation has always been about respecting freedom of choice. He gave Satan the option to rebel, and He did not immediately destroy him when he did. God permitted Adam and Eve to rebel too. Likewise, I am free to choose whether I want to serve Him or not. Jesus wants to save every person (<a>1 Timothy 2:3, 4</a>)&mdash;He wants me to choose Him (<a>Matthew 11:28-30</a>)&mdash;but He will not force Himself on anyone. In fact, this is a daily choice; I can choose, anytime, to leave Christ and go in another direction, which is why it’s imperative to reaffirm my decision and recommit myself to Him on a daily basis (<a>Luke 9:23</a>). Every single day is a gift from my Creator, and it’s my privilege to give it back to Him.

            <h2>What does it mean to accept Jesus as Savior and as Lord?</h2>
            <p>
              But grow in grace, and in the knowledge of <em>our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ</em>. To him be glory both now and for ever. Amen. <cite><b>2 Peter 3:18</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> Both are a fundamental aspect of salvation, but there is a difference between the two. Accepting Jesus as Savior means being saved from the penalty of sin (death) because He offers forgiveness for every sin that I’ve genuinely confessed and decided to forsake. Once forgiven, He credits me with His own righteousness so that my imperfect life is covered by His perfect life.
              <br><br>
              Accepting Jesus as Lord, on the other hand, means surrendering my will to Him, thereby making Him the ruler of my life. This is a decision that takes place daily (<a>Luke 9:23</a>) because our natural desire is to do and live as we please, but the Bible calls this way of life sin (<a>Isaiah 53:6</a>) because our human nature, by default, is contrary the law of God (<a>1 John 3:4</a>). The truth is God knows what is best for us better than we know ourselves, and He wants us to trust Him enough to allow Him to rule our lives, which, in turn, gives Him permission to mold us into Him image (<a>Ephesians 4:13)</a>. This surrender is crucial, because without it He does not have the right to transform our characters to reflect the beauty of His character.

            </p>
            <p>
              Let the wicked <em>forsake his way</em>, and the unrighteous man his thoughts: and let him return unto the LORD, and he will have mercy upon him; and to our God, for he will abundantly pardon. <cite><b>Isaiah 55:7</b></cite>

            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> Forsaking my way implies turning around and going in the opposite direction. I go from running away from God toward sin to running away from sin toward God. If I repent and have a desire to leave my sins behind, the promise is I will receive forgiveness.

              <em>Ask, and it shall be given you</em>; seek, and ye shall find; knock, and it shall be opened unto you: <em>for every one that asketh receiveth</em>; and he that seeketh findeth; and to him that knocketh it shall be opened. <cite><b>Matthew 7:7, 8</b></cite>

            </p>
            <p>
              What shall we then say to these things? <em>If God be for us, who can be against us</em>? He that spared not His own Son, but delivered Him up for us all, <em>how shall He not with Him also freely give us all things</em>? <cite><b>Romans 8:31, 32</b></cite>

            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> There is no sin too powerful for God, but He cannot do anything against my will either. If I confess my sins and ask Him to give me victory over them, believing that He is powerful enough to do it, He will do it according to my faith.

A new heart also will I give you, and a new spirit will I put within you</em>: and I will take away the stony heart out of your flesh, and I will give you an heart of flesh. And <em>I will put my spirit within you, and cause you to walk in my statutes, and ye shall keep my judgments, and do them</em>. <cite><b>Ezekiel 36:25-27</b></cite>

              <b>Note: </b> God wants to free me from the power of sin because sin hurts me. He can also give me the power to be free because I cannot change myself, just like a leopard cannot change his spots, but He can! He promises to give a new heart and a new spirit to those who ask Him.

          <section>
            <div>1</div>
            <h2>What is faith?</h2>
            <p>
              Now faith is the <em>substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen</em>. <cite><b>Hebrews 11:1</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> Faith is what reaches out and grasps things not seen that are backed up by evidence. In <a>Isaiah 1:18</a> God says, “Come now, and let us reason together,” which means He does not want anyone to blindly follow Him; on the contrary, He wants faith to be informed by evidence.
            </p>
          </section>
          <section>
            <div>2</div>
            <h2>Why is faith necessary?</h2>
            <p>
              But without faith it is impossible to please him: for <em>he that cometh to God must believe that he is</em>, and <em>that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him</em>. <cite><b>Hebrews 11:6</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> Faith is the means by which my journey with Jesus starts. It is the hand of faith that reaches out to grasp the outstretched hand of God. He is always ready and eager to help those who come to Him, but I must first believe in Him and His goodness. This faith is based on plentiful evidence, but the evidence does not remove the need for faith altogether. There will always be room for doubt for those who want to doubt simply because the finite human mind cannot fully grasp an everlasting, infinite God. Thus the need for faith: God said it&mdash;I believe it.
            </p>
          </section>
          <section>
            <div>3</div>
            <h2>How many have faith?</h2>
            <p>
              For I say, through the grace given unto me, to every man that is among you, not to think of himself more highly than he ought to think; but to think soberly, according as <em>God hath dealt to every man the measure of faith</em>. <cite><b>Romans 12:3</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> Fatih is like a muscle; every person has been given a measure of it. Some neglect it, never use it, and it grows weak. Others act on what they have, reaching out to God, and He meets them where they are, revealing Himself to them, which in turn makes their faith stronger, and then they act on that, and it continues to grow each time it is used.

            <h2>What if my faith is weak?</h2>
            <p>
              And the apostles said unto the Lord, <em>Increase our faith</em>. <cite><b>Luke 17:5</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              Jesus said unto him, If thou canst believe, all things are possible to him that believeth. And straightway the father of the child cried out, and said with tears, <em>Lord, I believe; help thou mine unbelief</em>. <cite><b>Mark 9:23, 24</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              Then came the disciples to Jesus apart, and said, Why could not we cast him out? And Jesus said unto them, Because of your unbelief: for verily I say unto you, <em>If ye have faith as a grain of mustard seed</em>, ye shall say unto this mountain, Remove hence to yonder place; and it shall remove; and nothing shall be impossible unto you. <cite><b>Matthew 17:19, 20</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> Even if my faith is weak and small as a tiny seed, I can exercise the faith that I do have, and ask God to increase it, believing in His power to do so, and it will be done.

            <h2>What is faith based on?</h2>
            <p>
              So then faith cometh by hearing, and hearing <em>by the word of God</em>. <cite><b>Romans 10:17</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              Another parable put he forth unto them, saying, The kingdom of heaven is <em>like to a grain of mustard seed</eM>, which a man took, and sowed in his field: which indeed is the least of all seeds: but <em>when it is grown, it is the greatest among herbs, and becometh a tree</em>, so that the birds of the air come and lodge in the branches thereof. <cite><b>Matthew 13:31, 32</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> Faith is primarily based on the evidence of truth revealed in the Word of God, the Bible. Like a seed that is watered by the rain, faith grows whenever it is watered with the truth of His Word and that truth is then internalized&mdash;received and allowed to take root in the heart. With my cooperation, God can take the small seed of faith and make it grow into a tall tree.

            <p>
              And Jesus answering saith unto them, Have faith in God. For verily I say unto you, That whosoever shall say unto this mountain, Be thou removed, and be thou cast into the sea; and shall not doubt in his heart, but shall believe that those things which he saith shall come to pass; he shall have whatsoever he saith. Therefore I say unto you, What things soever ye desire, <em>when ye pray, believe that ye receive them, and ye shall have them</em>. <cite><b>Mark 11:22-24</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              And when he was come into the house, the blind men came to him: and Jesus saith unto them, Believe ye that I am able to do this? They said unto him, Yea, Lord. Then touched he their eyes, saying, <em>According to your faith be it unto you</em>. And their eyes were opened. <cite><b>Matthew 9:28-30</b></cite>
            </p>

            <h2>What is the power of the gospel dependent on?</h2>
            <p>
              For unto us was the gospel preached, as well as unto them: but the word preached did not profit them, not <em>being mixed with faith in them that heard it</em>. <cite><b>Hebrews 4:2</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> The gospel is the good news of God’s desire and power to save humanity from the misery of sin. When the gospel is mingled with faith, it is acted on and received into the mind and heart, starting a marvelous process of transformation in the life of the receiver through the power of God.

            <p>
              That ye be not slothful, but followers of them who <em>through faith and patience inherit the promises</em>. <cite><b>Hebrews 6:12</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              <em>These all died in faith, not having received the promises, but having seen them afar off, and were persuaded of them, and embraced them</em>, and confessed that they were strangers and pilgrims on the earth. For they that say such things declare plainly that they seek a country. And truly, if they had been mindful of that country from whence they came out, they might have had opportunity to have returned. But now they desire a better country, that is, an heavenly: wherefore God is not ashamed to be called their God: for he hath prepared for them a city. <cite><b>Hebrews 11:13-16</b></cite>

              And <em>when he saw their faith</em>, he said unto him, Man, <em>thy sins are forgiven thee</em>. <cite><b>Luke 5:20</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> The Bible shows God is willing to forgive anyone who is truly repentant. When this evidence is acted on by faith, when I take God at His Word, He will forgive me too, just like He forgave the paralytic according to his faith.

            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> Salvation is only through faith. I am made righteous by faith in Jesus’ love as expressed in His willingness to forgive my sins and clothe me with His righteousness. I am also sanctified by faith in His power to save me from my sins. Salvation is completely of God; it is a gift. Faith is the means by which I reach out to Him and recieve that gift.

            <h2>What is evident in those who are saved by faith?</h2>
            <p>
              By whom [Jesus] we have received grace and apostleship, <em>for obedience to the faith</em> among all nations, for his name. <cite><b>Romans 1:5</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              Here is the patience of the saints: here are they that <em>keep the commandments of God, and the faith of Jesus</em>. <cite><b>Revelation 14:12</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> Those who have the faith of Jesus also keep the commandments of God because Jesus Himself kept them. In the book of Romans Paul says Jesus gives us grace for obedience to the faith. Now it is true that I am saved by faith alone, but it is also true that once I am saved by Jesus, my love for Him leads me to obey Him. Obedience is the result of salvation, not the means to it. It can only be born out of love for the One who died for me, and it is made possible by His grace working in me.

            <h2>Is there more evidence of this?</h2>
            <p>
              Even so <em>faith, if it hath not works, is dead</em>, being alone. Yea, a man may say, Thou hast faith, and I have works: shew me thy faith without thy works, and I will shew thee my faith by my works. Thou believest that there is one God; thou doest well: the devils also believe, and tremble. But wilt thou know, O vain man, that <em>faith without works is dead</em>?<cite><b>James 2:17-20</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              Do men gather grapes of thorns, or figs of thistles? Even so <em>every good tree bringeth forth good fruit; but a corrupt tree bringeth forth evil fruit</em>. ... Wherefore <em>by their fruits ye shall know them</em>. Not every one that saith unto me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of heaven; but <em>he that doeth the will of my Father</em> which is in heaven. Many will say to me in that day, Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied in thy name? and in thy name have cast out devils? and in thy name done many wonderful works? And then will I profess unto them, I never knew you: depart from me, ye that work iniquity.<cite><b>Matthew 7:16, 17, 20-23</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> Obedience shows the genuineness of my faith. Put another way, my faith is confirmed, or justified, to me by my works. They are evidence for me, not God, since He already knows my genuine heart (<a>Psalm 139:1-4</a>), but I do need the evidence because it’s easy to deceive myself about my true condition (<a>Jeremiah 17:9, 10</a>).

              Then the <em>king commanded to call the magicians, and the astrologers, and the sorcerers, and the Chaldeans, for to shew the king his dreams</em>. So they came and stood before the king. And the king said unto them, I have dreamed a dream, and my spirit was troubled to know the dream. Then spake the Chaldeans to the king in Syriack, O king, live for ever: tell thy servants the dream, and we will shew the interpretation.
              <br><br>
              The king answered and said to the Chaldeans, The thing is gone from me: if ye will not make known unto me the dream, with the interpretation thereof, ye shall be cut in pieces, and your houses shall be made a dunghill. But if ye shew the dream, and the interpretation thereof, ye shall receive of me gifts and rewards and great honour: therefore shew me the dream, and the interpretation thereof. They answered again and said, Let the king tell his servants the dream, and we will shew the interpretation of it.
              <br><br>
              The king answered and said, I know of certainty that ye would gain the time, because ye see the thing is gone from me. But if ye will not make known unto me the dream, there is but one decree for you: for ye have prepared lying and corrupt words to speak before me, till the time be changed: therefore tell me the dream, and I shall know that ye can shew me the interpretation thereof.
              <br><br>
              The Chaldeans answered before the king, and said, There is not a man upon the earth that can shew the king's matter: therefore there is no king, lord, nor ruler, that asked such things at any magician, or astrologer, or Chaldean. And <em>it is a rare thing that the king requireth, and there is none other that can shew it before the king, except the gods</em>, whose dwelling is not with flesh.

              And whereas thou sawest the feet and toes, part of potters' clay, and part of iron, the <em>kingdom shall be divided</em>; but there shall be in it of the strength of the iron, forasmuch as thou sawest the iron mixed with miry clay. And as the toes of the feet were part of iron, and part of clay, so the <em>kingdom shall be partly strong, and partly broken</em>. <cite><b>Daniel 2:41, 42</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> After the Roman empire crumled in A.D. 476, it was divided by barbarian tribes into numerous kingdoms symbolized by the toes on the image, seven of which exist today: the Ostrogoths (gone), Visigoths (Spain), Franks (France), Vandals (gone), Alemannians (Germany), Sueves (Portugal), Anglo-Saxons (England), Heruli (gone), and Lombards (Italy). The toes being partly of iron and partly of clay means some would be stronger than others.

            <h2>What would come after it?</h2>
            <p>
              And in the days of these kings shall the God of heaven set up <em>a kingdom, which shall never be destroyed</em>: and the kingdom shall not be left to other people, but it shall break in pieces and consume all these kingdoms, and <em>it shall stand for ever</em>. Forasmuch as thou sawest that the stone was cut out of the mountain without hands, and that it brake in pieces the iron, the brass, the clay, the silver, and the gold; the great God hath made known to the king what shall come to pass hereafter: and the dream is certain, and the interpretation thereof sure. <cite><b>Daniel 2:44-45</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> The stone cut without hands represents the kingdom of heaven, which will replace all the earthly kingdoms at the coming of Christ, and His reign will have no end. Since the stone strikes the image’s feet, Jesus will come during the time of the divided nations.

            <h2>What is the first sign Jesus mentions?</h2>
            <p>
              And as he sat upon the mount of Olives, the disciples came unto him privately, saying, Tell us, when shall these things be? and what shall be the sign of thy coming, and of the end of the world? And Jesus answered and said unto them, <em>Take heed that no man deceive you. For many shall come in my name, saying, I am Christ; and shall deceive many</em>. <cite><b>Matthew 24:3-5</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              For there <em>shall arise false Christs, and false prophets, and shall shew great signs and wonders</em>; insomuch that, if it were possible, they shall deceive the very elect. <cite><b>Matthew 24:24</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              For such are false apostles, deceitful workers, transforming themselves into the apostles of Christ. And no marvel; for <em>Satan himself is transformed into an angel of light</em>. <cite><b>2 Corinthians 11:13, 14</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> Jesus is emphasizing that deception will not only be prevelant in the lead-up to His coming, but it will also be powerful because it will be accompanied by signs and wonders. And it’s not just people who can pretend to be something they’re not, but Satan himself can appear as an angel of light.

            <p>
              And ye shall hear of <em>wars and rumours of wars</em>: see that ye be not troubled: for all these things must come to pass, but the end is not yet. For nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom: and <em>there shall be famines, and pestilences, and earthquakes, in divers places</em>. <cite><b>Matthew 24:6, 7</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              All these are the <em>beginning of birth pains</em>. <cite><b>Matthew 24:8, NIV</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> While wars, rumors of wars, famines, epidemics, and earthquakes have always been around, Jesus compares them to birth pains, which get more frequent and more intense with time.

            <h2>What sign does Paul give in one of his letters?</h2>
            <p>
              For yourselves know perfectly that the day of the Lord so cometh as a thief in the night. <em>For when they shall say, Peace and safety; then sudden destruction cometh upon them</em>, as travail upon a woman with child; and they shall not escape. <cite><b>1 Thessalonians 5:2, 3</b></cite>

            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> This is related to the previous sign of fear about the future because when there will be talk of peace and safety, the reality that follows will be the opposite.

            <p>
              This know also, that in the last days perilous times shall come. For men shall be <em>lovers of their own selves, covetous, boasters, proud, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy, Without natural affection, trucebreakers, false accusers, incontinent, fierce, despisers of those that are good, traitors, heady, highminded, lovers of pleasures more than lovers of God; having a form of godliness, but denying the power thereof</em>: from such turn away. <cite><b>2 Timothy 3:1-5</b></cite>

            <h2>What will people be preoccupied with?</h2>
            <p>
              And take heed to yourselves, lest at any time your hearts be overcharged with <em>surfeiting, and drunkenness, and cares of this life</em>, and so that day come upon you unawares. <cite><b>Luke 21:34</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              But <em>as the days of Noe were, so shall also the coming of the Son of man be</em>. For as in the days that were before the flood they were eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, until the day that Noe entered into the ark, and knew not until the flood came, and took them all away; so shall also the coming of the Son of man be. <cite><b>Matthew 24:37-39</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> There’s nothing wrong with marriage as it was instituted and blessed by God, and it’s impossible to survive without nourishing our bodies. The point is in Noah’s days most people ignored him. Life is busy, and it’s easy to get preoccupied with temporal things and neglect spiritual things. Where do our own priorities stand?

              Go to now, ye rich men, weep and howl for your miseries that shall come upon you. <em>Your riches are corrupted</em>, and your garments are motheaten. Your gold and silver is cankered; and the rust of them shall be a witness against you, and shall eat your flesh as it were fire. Ye have heaped treasure together for the last days. Behold, the <em>hire of the labourers who have reaped down your fields, which is of you kept back by fraud, crieth</em>: and the cries of them which have reaped are entered into the ears of the Lord of sabaoth. Ye have lived in pleasure on the earth, and been wanton; ye have nourished your hearts, as in a day of slaughter. <cite><b>James 5:1-5</b></cite>

              <em>Watch therefore</em>: for ye know not what hour your Lord doth come. But know this, that if the goodman of the house had known in what watch the thief would come, he would have watched, and would not have suffered his house to be broken up. Therefore <em>be ye also ready</em>: for in such an hour as ye think not the Son of man cometh. <cite><b>Matthew 24:42-44</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              Watch ye therefore, and <em>pray always</em>, that ye may be accounted worthy to escape all these things that shall come to pass, and to stand before the Son of man. <cite><b>Luke 21:36</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              I will say of the LORD, <em>He is my refuge and my fortress: my God; in him will I trust</em>. Surely <em>he shall deliver thee</em> from the snare of the fowler, and from the noisome pestilence. He shall cover thee with his feathers, and under his wings shalt thou trust: <em>his truth shall be thy shield and buckler</em>. <cite><b>Psalm 91:2-4</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> Those who watch for signs of Christ’s coming and pray that He will help them to be ready to meet Him won’t be disappointed. His truth will protect them from deception, and God will be with them every step of the way, no matter what happens.

            <h2>But why must they be kept out of heaven?</h2>
            <p>
              He answered and said unto them, He that soweth the good seed is the Son of man; the field is the world; the good seed are the children of the kingdom; but the tares are the children of the wicked one; the enemy that sowed them is the devil; the harvest is the end of the world; and the reapers are the angels. As therefore the tares are gathered and burned in the fire; so shall it be in the end of this world. The Son of man shall send forth his angels, and <em>they shall gather out of his kingdom all things that offend, and them which do iniquity</em>; and shall cast them into a furnace of fire: there shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth. Then shall the righteous shine forth as the sun in the kingdom of their Father. Who hath ears to hear, let him hear. <cite><b>Matthew 13:37-43</b></cite>

            <p class="note">

            <p>
              He that is unjust, let him be unjust still: and <em>he which is filthy, let him be filthy still: and he that is righteous, let him be righteous still</em>: and he that is holy, let him be holy still. And, behold, I come quickly; and my reward is with me, to give every man according as his work shall be. <cite><b>Revelation 22:11, 12</b></cite>

              <b>Note:</b> When Jesus returns there will be only two groups of people&mdash;the saved and the lost. It will also be too late to change sides because He returns with His reward, meaning the judgment has already happened and every person’s case has been decided.

            <h2>How does Revelation portray Jesus when He returns?</h2>
            <p>
              And I saw heaven opened, and behold a white horse; and he that sat upon him was called Faithful and True, and in righteousness he doth judge and make war. His eyes were as a flame of fire, and <em>on his head were many crowns</em>; and he had a name written, that no man knew, but he himself. And he was clothed with a vesture dipped in blood: and his name is called The Word of God. And <em>the armies which were in heaven followed him upon white horses</em>, clothed in fine linen, white and clean. And out of his mouth goeth a sharp sword, that with it he should smite the nations: and he shall rule them with a rod of iron: and he treadeth the winepress of the fierceness and wrath of Almighty God. And he hath on his vesture and on his thigh a name written, <em>KING OF KINGS, AND LORD OF LORDS</em>. <cite><b>Revelation 19:11-16</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> Because He has won the war with Satan, Jesus comes back as a victorious King surrounded by His angelic army.

            <h2>Why did God tell Moses to build a sanctuary?</h2>
            <p>
              And let them make me a sanctuary; <em>that I may dwell among them</em>. <cite><b>Exodus 25:8</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> The sanctuary was built so that God could dwell among His people. When Adam and Eve sinned, they lost the closeness they had with their Creator because sin separates us from Him (<a>Isaiah 59:1, 2</a>). Our Creator God is holy, and He cannot dwell in the presence of sin because His holiness is a consuming fire to sin and anyone who cherishes it (<a>Deuteronomy 4:24</a>). In order to remove this barrier created by sin, God told Moses to build a sanctuary so He could again live with His people. His permanent presence in the sanctuary would be a source of comfort to the Israelites as He guided, protected, and provided for them in their journey through life.

            <p>
              <em>Thy way</em>, O God, is in the sanctuary: who is so great a God as our God? <cite><b>Psalm 77:13</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> The sanctuary reveals God’s way of dealing with sin and its consequences; it’s His marvelous plan of salvation, the good news, outlined in detail through a variety of symbols and ceremonies.

            <h2>What was the central concept taught by the sanctuary?</h2>
            <p>
              And almost all things are by the law purged with blood; and <em>without shedding of blood is no remission</em>. <cite><b>Hebrews 9:22</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              For <em>the life of the flesh is in the blood</em>: and I have given it to you upon the altar to make an atonement for your souls: for <em>it is the blood that maketh an atonement for the soul</em>. <cite><b>Leviticus 17:11</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> The sanctuary service revolved around the sacrifice of animals, and this taught that blood, a symbol of life, had to be shed to obtain forgiveness of sin. But it wasn’t the blood of the sacrificed animals that provided forgiveness: theirs was merely a symbol that pointed to the only blood that could&mdash;the blood, and life, of the One who was sinned against. Jesus, the Creator of heaven and earth, is the Lamb of God slain from the foundation of the world (<a>Revelation 13:8</a>) who takes away my sins (<a>John 1:29</a>). The sanctuary thus provides a vivid portrayal of the high price of sin. It may seem insignificant to us, but sin ended up costing the very life Jesus, and if it wasn’t for His death on our behalf, it would’ve cost us our lives. Satan makes it look attractive, perhaps even life-giving at times, but the truth is sin always takes life away, while bringing pain, suffering, and, ultimately, death (<a>Romans 6:23</a>).

            <h2>Where did Moses get the sanctuary blueprint?</h2>
            <p>
              <em>According to all that I shew thee</em>, after the pattern of the tabernacle, and the pattern of all the instruments thereof, even so shall ye make it. <cite><b>Exodus 25:9</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> The blueprint for the sanctuary came from God Himself because, through it, He wanted to teach important lessons about the plan of salvation. Originally it was a portable, tent-like structure made of acacia wood, goat hair, animal skins, silver, and gold, consisting of three areas: the courtyard, the Holy Place, and the Most Holy Place.
              <br><br>
              The courtyard, the area around the sanctuary, was 75 feet by 150 feet (<a>Exodus 27:18</a>) and fenced with linen cloth attached to 60 evenly spaced pillars of brass (<a>Exodus 27:9-16</a>). This perimiter had only one opening through which the sinner would enter the courtyard. Upon entry, the sinner would walk toward the altar of burnt offering (<a>Exodus 40:6</a>), where his or her animal sacrifice would be consumed by fire. Past the altar, but before the sanctuary entrance, was a laver (basin) for the priests to wash their hands and feet.
              <br><br>
              The sanctuary itself was made up of two rooms, the Holy Place and the Most Holy Place, and the two were separated by a thick veil (curtain). The sanctuary walls were made of wooden boards overlaid in gold and set in silver sockets (<a>Exodus 26:15-19, 29</a>), while the roof consisted of four coverings: linen, goat hair, ram skin, and badger skin (<a>Exodus 26:1, 7-14</a>). Upon entry into the sanctuary, the first room was the Holy Place, containing a seven-branched candlestick that was kept burning at all times (<a>Exodus 25:31-40</a>), an altar of incense that was also kept consistently burning (<a>Exodus 30:7, 8</a>), and a table of showbread with loaves of bread on it (<a>Exodus 25:30; Leviticus 24:5-9</a>). Past the thick veil was the Most Holy Place, the room where the presence of God resided. It contained the Ark of the Covenant (<a>Exodus 40:3</a>), which had the mercy seat on top of it and two angels, made of pure gold, on top of the mercy seat (<a>Exodus 25:17-22</a>). Inside the ark were the Ten Commandments written with the finger of God (<a>Deuteronomy 10:4, 5</a>).

            <h2>Of what was the sanctuary a copy?</h2>
            <p>
              Now this is the main point of the things we are saying: We have such a High Priest, who is seated at the right hand of the throne of the Majesty in the heavens, a Minister <em>of the sanctuary and of the true tabernacle which the Lord erected, and not man</em>. For every high priest is appointed to offer both gifts and sacrifices. Therefore it is necessary that this One also have something to offer. For if He were on earth, He would not be a priest, since there are priests who offer the gifts according to the law; <em>who serve the copy and shadow of the heavenly things</em>, as Moses was divinely instructed when he was about to make the tabernacle. For He said, “See that you make all things according to the pattern shown you on the mountain.” <cite><b>Hebrews 8:1-5</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> The Hebrew sanctuary was a copy, a “shadow,” of the sanctuary in heaven of which Jesus is the High Priest, offering forgiveness of sins to the repenting sinner. In other words, God’s true sanctuary is the heavenly one, not the earthly one.

            <h2>How did a sinner receive forgiveness of sins?</h2>
            <p>
              And he shall lay his hand upon the head of the sin offering, and <em>slay it for a sin offering</em> in the place where they kill the burnt offering. <cite><b>Leviticus 4:33</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> A sinner would walk into the courtyard with a sacrificial lamb and approach the altar of burnt offering. Then he would confess his sins onto the lamb by placing his hand on its head (<a>Leviticus 4:29; 5:5</a>), symbolically transferring his sins to the lamb. Because the lamb was now symbolically guilty, it had to pay the penalty of sin&mdash;death, and the sinner would then slay the lamb with his own hand. Obviously, this was not an easy process, but it was intended to show the seriousness of sin. Afterward, the priest either ate part of the animal sacrifice (<a>Leviticus 6:26</a>) or sprinkled some of its blood inside the sanctuary (<a>Leviticus 4:16, 17</a>), depending on the sacrifice offered. This meant the sin was then transferred from the lamb to the priest and then into the sanctuary, and the sinner walked away free from the penalty of sin.

            <h2>How do I receive forgiveness of sins?</h2>
            <p>
              The next day John seeth Jesus coming unto him, and saith, <em>Behold the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the world</em>. <cite><b>John 1:29</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> The animal sacrifices pointed to the Lamb of God sacrificed in the “courtyard” of this earth on the “altar” of a hill called Calvary. While the Hebrews were forgiven by looking forward, in faith, to the future sacrifice of Jesus, I am forgiven by looking backward, in faith, to what is now a completed sacrifice on the cross on my behalf. When Jesus died, the veil separating the Holy Place from the Most Holy Place in the earthly sanctuary was torn from top to bottom (<a>Matthew 27:51</a>), a divine indication that its services were obsolete from that moment on because the One true and great sacrifice they were all pointing to had been accomplished (<a>Daniel 9:27</a>). Any talk of building a new temple in Jerusalem to reinstitute those services is a denial of Jesus’ sacrificial death on behalf of and for all.

            <h2>What did the sanctuary furniture represent?</h2>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> Every piece of furniture points to Jesus and represents an aspect of His work on my behalf to save me from sin: <br>
              &emsp;&bull; The altar of burnt offering represents the cross, while the animal represents Jesus, the ultimate sacrifice (<a>John 1:29</a>).<br>
              &emsp;&bull; The laver points to Jesus as the Living Water cleansing me from sin and giving me a new birth through the Holy Spirit (<a>John 4:10; Titus 3:5</a>). <br>
              &emsp;&bull; The candlestick points to Jesus as the Light of the world (<a>John 1:9; 9:5</a>), while its oil represents the Holy Spirit (<a>Zechariah 4:1-6; Revelation 4:5</a>). <br>
              &emsp;&bull; The showbread is a symbol of Jesus being the Bread of Life (<a>John 6:48, 51</a>), which I an invited to internalize by reading His Word&mdash;the Bible (<a>Matthew 4:4</a>). The altar of incense represents the righteousness of Jesus mixed with the prayers of God’s people (<a>Revelation 5:8; 8:3</a>). <br>
              &emsp;&bull; The ark of the covenant represents God’s throne in heaven (<a>Psalm 80:1</a>), but there is more to it. Because God’s Ten Commandments were inside the ark, it shows how His law of love (see “God’s Law of Love”), which is a reflection of His character, is the foundation of His government. But since the mercy seat was over the Ten Commandments, it also represents His mercy being extended, through the blood that was sprinkled on the seat by the priest (<a>Leviticus 16:15, 16</a>), to those who confess and forsake sin after breaking His law. It’s beautiful! And of course, the sprinkled blood was a symbol of Jesus’ blood shed on behalf of all people (<a>Matthew 26:28</a>).

            <h2>Do I have a High Priest today?</h2>
            <p>
              But <em>Christ being come an high priest</em> of good things to come, by a greater and more perfect tabernacle, not made with hands, that is to say, not of this building; neither by the blood of goats and calves, but <em>by his own blood he entered in once into the holy place, having obtained eternal redemption for us</em>. <cite><b>Hebrews 9:11, 12</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              For there is one God, and <em>one mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus</em>. <cite><b>1 Timothy 2:15</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> The sprinkling of blood by the priest foreshadowed Jesus’ current ministry in the heavenly sanctuary that He started after rising from the dead and returning to heaven. He is now my High Priest, presenting His own blood for my sins so they can be forgiven when I confess them in His name (<a>1 John 1:9</a>). In other words, the salvation process did not end at the cross but continues to this day in the heavenly sanctuary. Just like the priest was the mediator between God and sinners in the earthly sanctuary, Jesus is now our Mediator, the link between our human weakness and God’s divine power, reconciling us to God.

            <h2>What does this reconciliation entail?</h2>
            <p>
              Seeing then that <em>we have a great high priest, that is passed into the heavens, Jesus the Son of God</em>, let us hold fast our profession. <cite><b>Hebrews 4:14</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              Wherefore he is able also to save them to the uttermost that come unto God by him, seeing <em>he ever liveth to make intercession for them</em>. <cite><b>Hebrews 7:25</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              Being justified freely by his grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus: whom God hath set forth to be a propitiation through faith in his blood, <em>to declare his righteousness for the remission of sins that are past</em>, through the forbearance of God. <cite><b>Romans 3:24, 25</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              Who gave himself for us, that he might <em>redeem us from all iniquity, and purify unto himself a peculiar people</em>, zealous of good works. <cite><b>Titus 2:14</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              For it is <em>God which worketh in you both to will and to do</em> of his good pleasure. <cite><b>Philippians 2:13</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> As my High Priest, Jesus accomplishes two amazing miracles when I genuinely confess my sins against Him and fully surrender my heart to Him: His perfect life is first imputed to me (I receive credit for it), allowing Him to wipe my sinful record clean, then its imparted to me (becomes a part of me) through a new birth, enabling me to live a life of victory in the present (<a>John 3:3-6</a>)! These two miracles make me righteous before God, which is something I can never accomplish through my own efforts (<a>Acts 4:12</a>). This is righteousness by faith&mdash;trusting my Savior to do for me and in me what I can never do for and in myself.

            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> There are several promises God gives me: <br>
              &emsp;&bull; If I confess my sins, He promises to forgive them by ascribing Jesus’ sinless life and atoning death to me, thereby removing the death sentence from me and counting me as guiltless (<a>1 John 1:9; Isaiah 1:18; 44:22; 2 Corinthians 5:21</a>). <br>
              &emsp;&bull; He promises to restore His image in me that was lost in Eden by giving me in a new heart (<a>Romans 8:29; Genesis 1:26, 27; Ezekiel 36:25-27</a>). <br>
              &emsp;&bull; He promises to give me the desire and the power to live righteously (<a>Philippians 2:13; Hebrews 13:20, 21</a>). <br>
              &emsp;&bull; He will remain faithful to His work of restoring His image in me until I stand before His throne in heaven (<a>Philippians 1:6; Jude 1:24</a>). <br>

          <section>
            <div>12</div>
            <h2>Do I have a role to play in this?</h2>
            <p>
              Not every one that saith unto me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of heaven; but <em>he that doeth the will of my Father</em> which is in heaven. <cite><b>Matthew 7:21</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> The promises mentioned above can become a reality only if I give Jesus the permission to perform them by making Him the Ruler of my life, and this commitment needs to be renewed every day (<a>1 Corinthians 15:31; Luke 9:23</a>) because He can continue His work in me only if I continue to cooperate with and remain fully surrendered to Him. This involves choosing to die to self daily because my carnal, selfish nature is naturally in enmity against God (<a>Romans 8:5-9</a>), but Jesus’ life was one of selflessness, so He calls me to follow Him (<a>John 12:26; 1 Peter 2:21</a>) even though the natural desire is to go my own way (<a>Isaiah 53:6</a>).
              <br><br>
              He compares the surrender of self to getting an eye plucked out or a hand cut off (<a>Matthew 5:29, 30</a>) because sin is addictive and selfishness is natural, but it can and will be overcome, by God’s power (<a>Mark 10:26, 27</a>), in the lives of those whom Jesus calls His own. In another place, He compares His life of self denial to a narrow path (<a>Matthew 7:13, 14</a>), so clearly this is not the path chosen by the majority. This is why a mere profession of faith in a life of conscious rebellion against His law is, ultimately, a shallow profession (<a>1 John 2:3-6</a>). Jesus shares heaven with those who share His selfless character, and this is a miracle only He can perform, but only if I give Him full control of my life (<a>Matthew 19:27</a>).

            <h2>What was the Day of Atonement?</h2>
            <p>
              Also on the tenth day of this seventh month there shall be a day of atonement: <em>it shall be an holy convocation unto you; and ye shall afflict your souls</em>, and offer an offering made by fire unto the LORD. <cite><b>Leviticus 23:27</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> The Day of Atonement (Yom Kippur) was a yearly occurance and the only time the High Priest entered the Most Holy Place. It was a solemn day of judgment, introspection, and repentance to ensure there was no unconfessed sin in one’s life. Anyone who refused to separate from sin was cut off from the camp of Israel (<a>Leviticus 23:29</a>). During this day the sanctuary was cleansed from the sins that had been trasferred there throughout the year because as the people offered sacrifices for sin, their sin was then symbolically transferred to the lamb, from the lamb to the priest, and, finally, from the priest to the sanctuary itself (see question 6).

            <h2>How was the sanctuary cleansed?</h2>
            <p>
              And he shall <em>take the two goats, and present them before the LORD</em> at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation. And Aaron shall cast lots upon the two goats; one lot for the LORD, and the other lot for the scapegoat. And Aaron <em>shall bring the goat upon which the LORD'S lot fell, and offer him for a sin offering. But the goat, on which the lot fell to be the scapegoat, shall be presented alive before the LORD</em>, to make an atonement with him, and to let him go for a scapegoat into the wilderness. <cite><b>Leviticus 16:7-10</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              And this shall be a statute for ever unto you: that in the seventh month, on the tenth day of the month, <em>ye shall afflict your souls, and do no work at all</em>, whether it be one of your own country, or a stranger that sojourneth among you: For <em>on that day shall the priest make an atonement for you, to cleanse you, that ye may be clean from all your sins before the LORD</em>. <cite><b>Leviticus 16:29, 30</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> Once a year, on the Day of Atonement, two goats were selected. The Lord’s goat was killed as a sacrifice for the sins of God’s people (<a>Leviticus 16:9</a>), and the blood was taken by the high priest into the Most Holy Place and sprinkled upon and before the mercy seat (<a>Leviticus 16:14</a>). This represented the blood of Jesus and the mercy of God available to anyone who chooses to confess and forsake sin. God accepted the sprinkled blood, and the confessed sins of the people were then transferred from the sanctuary to the high priest, who then transferred them to the second goat&mdash;the scapegoat, which represented Satan (<a>Leviticus 16:8</a>). In this manner the sanctuary was cleansed from the sins of the people transferred there throughout the year (<a>Leviticus 16:30</a>).
              <br><br>
              The scapegoat was then led into the wilderness (<a>Leviticus 16:21, 22</a>) where it died, representing Satan’s punishment for the sins of the world because after Jesus’ Second Coming, Satan will be confined to the uninhabited, desolate wilderness of earth for 1,000 years (<a>Revelation 20:1-3</a>; see “1,000 Years of Peace”), and at the end of this period, he will perish in the lake of fire (<a>Revelation 20:10</a>; see “Is Hell Forever?”).

            <h2>What did the Day of Atonement foreshadow?</h2>
            <p>
              It was therefore necessary that <em>the patterns of things in the heavens should be purified</em> with these; but the heavenly things themselves with better sacrifices than these. <cite><b>Hebrews 9:23</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> Since the earthly sanctuary and it’s services were a foreshadow of the heavenly sanctuary, the Day of Atonement was pointing to the cleansing of the heavenly sanctuary (see “2,300 Day Prophecy”) by the real High Priest, Jesus Christ, the real Mediator between God and man (<a>1 Timothy 2:5</a>) who offers forgiveness and cleansing from sin to anyone who exercises faith in His substitutionary sacrifice.
              <br><br>
              In the broadest aspect, the Day of Atonement lead to sin being eradicated from the camp of Israel, which pointed to a future time when sin would be eradicated from the universe forever. Then and only then will the atonement be completed and the universe restored to its pre-sin state. The story of the sanctuary, therefore, is far reaching and all-encompassing, covering the entire history of the human race, from the fall of Adam and Eve in Eden to the restoration of the fallen race in the new heavenly Eden!

            <h2>What makes Jesus the perfect High Priest?</h2>
            <p>
              Therefore, <em>in all things He had to be made like His brethren</em>, that He might be a merciful and faithful High Priest in things pertaining to God, to make propitiation for the sins of the people. <em>For in that He Himself has suffered, being tempted, He is able to aid those who are tempted</em>. <cite><b>Hebrews 2:17, 18, NKJV</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              For we do not have a High Priest who cannot sympathize with our weaknesses, but <em>was in all points tempted as we are</em>, yet without sin. Let us therefore come boldly to the throne of grace, that we may obtain mercy and find grace to help in time of need. <cite><b>Hebrews 4:15, 16</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> Because Jesus was born in human flesh, He experienced all of the temptations that we experience, and because He knows what it feels like to wrestle with sin, He is full of mercy and compassion toward anyone who comes to Him in confession and repentence. Because He successfully resisted temptation (<a>1 John 3:5</a>) and gained victory over sin, He is ever ready to help me overcome sin in my own life. He wants me to experience an abundant life (<a>John 10:10</a>) that is free from the power of sin (<a>John 8:31, 31</a>).
              <br><br>
              The pain, misery, and suffering of sin was never a part of His plan for us. The human race brought it into the world, and the sanctuary shows that God takes it very seriously. His justice cannot excuse it, but, in His mercy, He also takes the burden of providing a way out of it entirely upon Himself, and He gives the remedy&mdash;freely&mdash;to anyone willing to take it. He is our merciful High Priest who shed His own blood so our record of sin could be blotted out. The only question is have you accepted His offer of mercy? Have your sins been covered by the blood of the Lamb?

            <h2>Has the judgment already begun?</h2>
            <p>
              And I saw another angel fly in the midst of heaven, having the everlasting gospel to preach unto them that dwell on the earth, and to every nation, and kindred, and tongue, and people, saying with a loud voice, Fear God, and give glory to him; <em>for the hour of his judgment is come</em>: and worship him that made heaven, and earth, and the sea, and the fountains of waters. <cite><b>Revelation 14:6, 7</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              And, behold, I come quickly; and my reward is with me, <em>to give every man according as his work shall be</em>. <cite><b>Revelation 22:12</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> In <a>Acts 24:25</a> Paul talks about a coming judgment, meaning it had not happened yet. In Revelation 14, on the other hand, there are three angels proclaiming a message to the people of the world in the last days, and the first angel’s message is that the judgment has begun. So the judgment begins in the last days, which we are living in (see “2,300 Day Prophecy”). When Jesus comes back to earth He’s bringing a reward with Him, which means the judgment has already taken place to decide who will be saved and what their reward will be.

            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> Every person who has ever lived on planet earth will be judged. Furthermore, each person will be responsible for his or her own actions; it will not be possible to hide behind another person’s decisions, actions, or ultimatums.

            <p>
              I beheld till the thrones were cast down, and <em>the Ancient of Days did sit</em>, whose garment was white as snow, and the hair of his head like the pure wool: his throne was like the fiery flame, and his wheels as burning fire. A fiery stream issued and came forth from before him: thousand thousands ministered unto him, and ten thousand times ten thousand stood before him: the <em>judgment was set, and the books were opened</em>. <cite><b>Daniel 7:9, 10</b></cite>
            </p>

            </p>
            <p>
              My little children, these things write I unto you, that ye sin not. And if any man sin, <em>we have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous</em>. <cite><b>1 John 2:1</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              And the great dragon was cast out, that old serpent, called <em>the Devil, and Satan</em>, which deceiveth the whole world: he was cast out into the earth ... for <em>the accuser of our brethren</em> is cast down, which accused them before our God day and night. <cite><b>Revelation 12:9, 10</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> God the Father, the Ancient of Days, presides over the judgment, while Jesus is the Judge, as well as our Advocate! Satan is our only accusser, declaring that we don’t deserve to be saved any more than he does.

            <p>
              Let us hear the conclusion of the whole matter: Fear God, and keep his commandments: for this is the whole duty of man. For <em>God shall bring every work into judgment, with every secret thing</em>, whether it be good, or whether it be evil. <cite><b>Ecclesiastes 12:13, 14</b></cite>
            </p>

            </p>
            <p>
              Therefore judge nothing before the time, until the Lord come, who both will <em>bring to light the hidden things of darkness, and will make manifest the counsels of the hearts</em>: and then shall every man have praise of God. <cite><b>1 Corinthians 4:5</b></cite>

            <h2>Does God keep a record of evidence for the judgment?</h2>
            <p>
              And I saw the dead, small and great, stand before God; and the books were opened: and another book was opened, which is the book of life: and <em>the dead were judged out of those things which were written in the books, according to their works</em>. <cite><b>Revelation 20:12</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              And there shall in no wise enter into it any thing that defileth, neither whatsoever worketh abomination, or maketh a lie: <em>but they which are written in the Lamb's book of life</em>. <cite><b>Revelation 21:27</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              For though thou wash thee with nitre, and take thee much soap, yet <em>thine iniquity is marked before me</em>, saith the Lord GOD. <cite><b>Jeremiah 2:22</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              Then those who feared the Lord spoke to one another, and the Lord listened attentively and heard it, and a <em>book of remembrance was written before Him for those who fear the Lord and esteem His name</em>. <cite><b>Malachi 3:16, NASB</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> Evidence for the judgment comes from books containing every detail of a person’s life, including every sin. There is also a Book of Remembrance containing every kind word, unselfish act, or sacrifice made by those who follow Jesus as evidence of God’s transforming power in their lives. These people’s names are also written in the Book of Life.

            <h2>What is God’s standard in the judgment?</h2>
            <p>
              If ye fulfil the royal law according to the scripture, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself, ye do well: But if ye have respect to persons, ye commit sin, and are <em>convinced of the law as transgressors</em>. For whosoever shall keep the whole law, and yet offend in one point, he is guilty of all. For he that said, Do not commit adultery, said also, Do not kill. Now if thou commit no adultery, yet if thou kill, thou art become a transgressor of the law. So speak ye, and so do, as they that <em>shall be judged by the law of liberty</em>. <cite><b>James 2:10-12</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              Whosoever committeth sin transgresseth also the law: for <em>sin is the transgression of the law</em>. <cite><b>1 John 3:4</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> If God keeps a record of our sins, and sin is the transgression of the law, then the Ten Commandment law is God’s standard by which we will be judged.

            </p>
            <p>
              Wherefore, as by one man sin entered into the world, and death by sin; and so <em>death passed upon all men</em>, for that all have sinned. <cite><b>Romans 5:12</b></cite>

            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> Because all have sinned, everyone is under condemnation before the law. If nothing is done to remedy the situation, by default, every person sits on "death row" and simply waits for the judgment.

              But this man, because he continueth ever, hath an unchangeable priesthood. Wherefore he is able also to save them to the uttermost that come unto God by him, seeing <em>he ever liveth to make intercession for them</em>. <cite><b>Hebrews 7:24, 25</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              For we have not an high priest which cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities; but was <em>in all points tempted like as we are, yet without sin</em>. Let us therefore come boldly unto the throne of grace, that we may obtain mercy, and find grace to help in time of need. <cite><b>Hebrews 4:15-16</b></cite>

            <p class="note">

              Nevertheless I tell you the truth; It is expedient for you that I go away: for if I go not away, the Comforter will not come unto you; but if I depart, I will send him unto you. And when he is come, <em>he will reprove the world of sin</em>, and of righteousness, and of judgment. <cite><b>John 16:7, 8</b></cite>
            </p>

            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> The Holy Spirit plays a crucial role as well by convicting us of sin and bringing to remembrance sins we have not confessed yet so there isn’t a single unconfessed sin left in our heavenly record for Satan to point to as a witness against us in the judgment.

            <p>
              There is therefore now <em>no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus</em>, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit. For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus hath made me free from the law of sin and death. For what the law could not do, in that it was weak through the flesh, God sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh, and for sin, condemned sin in the flesh: <em>that the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit</em>. <cite><b>Romans 8:1-4</b></cite>

              He that overcometh, the same shall be <em>clothed in white raiment</em>; and I will <em>not blot out his name out of the book of life</em>, but I will confess his name before my Father, and before his angels. <cite><b>Revelation 3:5</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>

            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> Those whose record of sin has been blotted out are no longer under condemnation because they have been forgiven through Christ, who paid the penalty for their sin on the cross and who stands before the law on their behalf with His perfect character.

            <h2>What warning did Jesus give to Christians?</h2>
            <p>
              And take heed to yourselves, lest at any time your hearts be overcharged with <em>surfeiting, and drunkenness, and cares of this life</em>, and so that day come upon you unawares. <cite><b>Luke 21:34</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              For the Son of man is as a man taking a far journey, who left his house, and gave authority to his servants, and to every man his work, and commanded the porter to watch. Watch ye therefore: for ye know not when the master of the house cometh, at even, or at midnight, or at the cockcrowing, or in the morning: <em>Lest coming suddenly he find you sleeping</em>. <cite><b>Mark 13:34-36</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> Jesus warned about four specific things: <br>
              &emsp; &bull; <em>Surfeiting</em>: This means “excess,” and it can be anything that disturbs balance and violates the principle of temperance (<a>Galatians 5:22-25</a>), such as overeating, overwork, or even recreation, which is very beneficial when done it moderation. <br>
              &emsp; &bull; <em>Drunkenness</em>: This is anything that brings about a spiritual stupor, destroys clear thinking, and removes our desire for heavenly things. Examples include pornography, alcoholism, illicit sex, worldly entertainment, and so on, because they lead to living in a dream world. <br>
              &emsp; &bull; <em>Cares of this life</em>: These are perfectly fine activities that are a part of life, but when they take over our lives they take time away from Jesus and shift our focus away from eternal realities, leading to less time spent in prayer, studying His word, and being an active member of His church. <br>
              &emsp; &bull; <em>Sleeping</em>: Jesus is referring to spiritually asleep here, and this involves taking the Bible and the truth it reveals about Him for granted. It’s being indifferent about our relationship with Jesus and neglecting the principles of His kingdom (<a>2 Timothy 3:5</a>). In <a>Revelation 3:15-19</a> it’s described as being lukewarm&mdash;being falsely satisfied with one’s own spiritual condition and not being actively involved in the work of Jesus. Perhaps the biggest problem with sleep is being unaware that one is asleep! But the good news is Jesus still patiently knocks at the door of the heart. Have you let Him in?

            <h2>What did Felix do when he was convicted?</h2>
            <p>
              And as he reasoned of righteousness, temperance, and judgment to come, Felix trembled, and answered, <em>Go thy way for this time; when I have a convenient season, I will call for thee</em>. <cite><b>Acts 24:25</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              For he saith, I have heard thee in a time accepted, and in the day of salvation have I succoured thee: behold, now is the accepted time; behold, <em>now is the day of salvation</em>. <cite><b>2 Corinthians 6:2</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> When the Holy Spirit convicts it is not wise to ignore it or put it off to a more convenient time because that time may never come. Tomorrow is not guaranteed; today is the day to get right with God.

            <h2>What does Daniel see in chapter eight?</h2>
            <p>
              Then I lifted up mine eyes, and saw, and, behold, there stood before the river <em>a ram which had two horns</em>: and the two horns were high; but one was higher than the other, and the higher came up last. I saw the ram pushing westward, and northward, and southward; so that no beasts might stand before him, neither was there any that could deliver out of his hand; but he did according to his will, and became great. <cite><b>Daniel 8:3, 4</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              The ram which thou sawest having two horns are <em>the kings of Media and Persia</em>. <cite><b>Daniel 8:20</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> Daniel sees a two-horned lamb, which we later learn represents the kingdom of Medo-Persia. This same kingdom was represented by a bear in <a>Daniel 7:5</a> since the Bible operates on the principle of “repeat and expand” where the prophecy is repeated and more detail is added.

            <h2>What does he see next?</h2>
            <p>
              And as I was considering, behold, <em>an he goat came from the west</em> on the face of the whole earth, and touched not the ground: and the goat had a notable horn between his eyes. And he came to the ram that had two horns, which I had seen standing before the river, and ran unto him in the fury of his power. And I saw him come close unto the ram, and he was moved with choler against him, and smote the ram, and brake his two horns: and there was no power in the ram to stand before him, but he cast him down to the ground, and stamped upon him: and there was none that could deliver the ram out of his hand. Therefore the he goat waxed very great: and when he was strong, the great horn was broken; and for it came up four notable ones toward the four winds of heaven. <cite><b>Daniel 8:5-8</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              And the <em>rough goat is the king of Grecia</em>: and the great horn that is between his eyes is the first king. Now that being broken, whereas four stood up for it, four kingdoms shall stand up out of the nation, but not in his power. <cite><b>Daniel 8:21, 22</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> Daniel then sees a goat with a large horn moving so swiftly that its feet never touch the ground. The goat attacks the ram, conquers it, and the goat’s horn is then broken off and replaced with four other horns. We later learn this goat represents the kingdom of Greece. The great horn is none other than Alexander the Great, while the four horns it’s replaced by represent the four kingdoms into which his empire was divided. In <a>Daniel 7:6</a> this same kingdom is represented by a leopard with four heads.

            <h2>What happens next?</h2>
            <p>
              And out of one of them <em>came forth a little horn, which waxed exceeding great</em>, toward the south, and toward the east, and toward the pleasant land. And it waxed great, even to the host of heaven; and it cast down some of the host and of the stars to the ground, and stamped upon them. Yea, <em>he magnified himself even to the prince of the host</em>, and by him the daily sacrifice was taken away, and <em>the place of his sanctuary was cast down</em>. And an host was given him against the daily sacrifice by reason of transgression, and <em>it cast down the truth to the ground</em>; and it practised, and prospered. <cite><b>Daniel 8:9-12</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> Next, Daniel sees a little horn emerge. Using the principle of “repeat and expand” this can be none other than Rome in both its pagan and papal forms because Daniel chapters 2 (see “Europe’s Future Revealed”) and 7 (see “Who Is the Antichrist?”) both point to Rome as the next kingdom after Greece. Later, this little horn is “broken without hand” (<a>Daniel 8:25</a>), meaning destroyed supernaturally by the coming of Christ, which is an echo of <a>Daniel 2:34</a> where a stone “cut out without hands” puts an end to human civilization. This also fits with <a>Daniel 7:24-27</a> where it says that papal Rome will be overcome by the kingdom of Christ.
              <br><br>
              <a>Daniel 8:9</a> gives another clue when it describes the direction of little horn’s expansion, which fits the expansion of Rome perfectly: toward the south (Egypt), toward the east (Macedonia), and the “pleasant land” (Palestine). Furthermore, <a>Daniel 8:4</a> describes Medo-Persia as becoming “great,” Greece becomes “very great” (<a>Daniel 8:8</a>), and the little horn becomes “exceeding great.” Rome is the only power following Greece that became “exceeding great.”
              <br><br>
              The little horn also “magnified himself even to the prince of the host” (<a>Daniel 8:11</a>), and verse 25 says it will “stand up against the Prince of princes” (<a>Daniel 8:25</a>). These are clear references to Jesus Christ, and once again, pagan Rome, being the power that crucified Him, fits these points. Papal Rome, on the other hand, effectively tries to replace Jesus’ ministry, as our High Priest in the heavenly sanctuary (<a>Hebrews 8:1, 2</a>), with an earthly priesthood claiming to forgive sins even though the Bible teaches Jesus is our only Mediator (<a>1 Timothy 2:5</a>), and only God can forgive sins (<a>Luke 5:21</a>). This casts the truth of the heavenly sanctuary to the ground (<a>Daniel 8:11</a>), trampling it underfoot (<a>Daniel 8:13</a>), thereby fulfilling those points as well.

            <h2>How long would the sanctuary be trampled underfoot?</h2>
            <p>
              Then I heard one saint speaking, and another saint said unto that certain saint which spake, How long shall be the vision concerning the daily sacrifice, and the transgression of desolation, to give both the sanctuary and the host to be trodden under foot? And he said unto me, <em>Unto two thousand and three hundred days; then shall the sanctuary be cleansed</em>. <cite><b>Daniel 8:13, 14</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> The reply was that the sanctuary would be cleansed after 2,300 days, which is 2,300 literal years in Bible prophecy (<a>Ezekiel 4:6; Numbers 14:34</a>). We’ve already learned that in the time of ancient Israel the earthly sanctuary was cleansed on the Day of Atonement (see “Finding Hope in the Sanctuary”). This was a day when the camp of Israel was cleansed from sin because God’s true followers were identified and their sins removed, while those who clung to sin were separated from the camp. In the same manner, Daniel is shown here that sin and the little horn power would not control and oppress the world forever; instead, God would intervene after 2,300 years with the heavenly Day of Atonement during which the process of removing sin would begin.

            <h2>To what time does this prophecy apply?</h2>
            <p>
              So he came near where I stood: and when he came, I was afraid, and fell upon my face: but he said unto me, Understand, O son of man: for <em>at the time of the end shall be the vision</em>. <cite><b>Daniel 8:17</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              And the vision of the evening and the morning which was told is true: wherefore <em>shut thou up the vision; for it shall be for many days</em>. <cite><b>Daniel 8:26</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> The angel made it clear that this prophecy dealt with end time events, which means it’s particularly relevant for us. Daniel was perplexed by the vision and actually fell ill after receiving it (<a>Daniel 8:27</a>), but in the next chapter God sent the angel Gabriel to explain the vision to him (<a>Daniel 9:21-23</a>).

            <h2>How much time was alloted to Daniel’s people?</h2>
            <p>
              <em>Seventy weeks are determined upon thy people and upon thy holy city</em>, to finish the transgression, and to make an end of sins, and <em>to make reconciliation for iniquity</em>, and to bring in everlasting righteousness, and to seal up the vision and prophecy, and to anoint the most Holy. <cite><b>Daniel 9:24</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> The angel says that seventy weeks were alloted to the Jewish people, which would equal 490 days (70 * 7), which represent 490 years in Bible prophecy. At the time of the vision God’s people were in captivity in Medo-Persia, but soon they were to return home, and God was giving them 490 years out of the 2,300 as another opportunity to repent from their sins and be reconciled to Him.

            <h2>What was the starting point for the prophecy?</h2>
            <p>
              Know therefore and understand, <em>that from the going forth of the command to restore and build Jerusalem</em> until Messiah the Prince, there shall be seven weeks and sixty-two weeks; the street shall be built again, and the wall, even in troublesome times. <cite><b>Daniel 9:25, NKJV</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              And there went up some of the children of Israel, and of the priests, and the Levites, and the singers, and the porters, and the Nethinims, unto Jerusalem, <em>in the seventh year of Artaxerxes the king</em>. <cite><b>Ezra 7:7</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> The starting point was a decree giving authorization to God’s people to rebuild Jerusalem. The decree was issued by King Artaxerxes in 457 B.C. on the seventh year of his reign and implemented in autumn of that year. The story is described in <a>Ezra 7:7-26</a>.

            <h2>How many weeks were there until the Messiah?</h2>
            <p>
              Know therefore and understand, that from the going forth of the command to restore and build Jerusalem <em>until Messiah the Prince, there shall be seven weeks and sixty-two weeks</em>; the street shall be built again, and the wall, even in troublesome times. <cite><b>Daniel 9:25, NKJV</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> The angel said that from 457 B.C. there would be 69 weeks or 483 days (69 * 7), which represent 483 literal years. So starting with -457 and adding 483 gives us 26, but since there is no year 0, we add one year, which brings us to the year A.D. 27, the baptism of Jesus (<a>Luke 3:21, 22</a>). The word “Messiah” means “anointed,” and it was during His baptism that He was anointed with the Holy Spirit (<a>Acts 10:38</a>). The baptism year is confirmed in <a>Luke 3:1</a> as the fifteenth year of Tiberius Caesar’s reign (A.D. 27), which is remarkable considering the prophecy was made over 500 years before! After His baptism Jesus began to preach that “the time is fulfilled” (<a>Mark 1:14, 15</a>), a clear reference to the 2,300 year prophecy and an indication of its importance. The prophecy, therefore, not only makes it plain that Jesus is the Messiah, but it also testifies that the Bible is divinely inspired!

            <h2>When was the Messiah to be “cut off”?</h2>
            <p>
              And after the sixty-two weeks <em>Messiah shall be cut off, but not for Himself</em>; and the people of the prince who is to come shall destroy the city and the sanctuary. The end of it shall be with a flood, and till the end of the war desolations are determined. Then He shall confirm a covenant with many for one week; but <em>in the middle of the week He shall bring an end to sacrifice and offering</em>. And on the wing of abominations shall be one who makes desolate, even until the consummation, which is determined, is poured out on the desolate. <cite><b>Daniel 9:26, 27, NKJV</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              But <em>He was wounded for our transgressions, He was bruised for our iniquities</em>: the chastisement of our peace was upon Him; and with His stripes we are healed. <cite><b>Isaiah 53:5</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> Since there are 69 weeks from 457 B.C. to A.D. 27, there is one week left (7 days, that is, 7 years) in the 490 year prophecy (see question 6). In the middle of that last week in A.D. 31, three and a half years after His baptism, Jesus was “cut off” (crucified) not for Himself, since He was sinless (<a>1 Peter 2:22</a>), but for us, thereby bringing an end to the system of animal sacrifices, which was confirmed by the veil in the temple being miraculously torn from top to bottom (<a>Matthew 27:50, 51</a>). The One to whom all the sacrifices pointed gave Himself, as the great and true sacrifice, for the remission of our sins (<a>Romans 3:25; 1 Corinthians 15:3</a>), to heal us from the wound of sin!
              <br><br>
              By the way, the Passover lamb was sacrificed every year on the 14th day of the Hebrew month of Nisan, and Jesus, our Passover Lamb, died exactly on that day. The priests were getting ready to sacrifice the Passover lamb as the true Lamb was hanging on the cross, about to be sacrificed for the sins of the world (<a>1 Corinthians 5:7</a>). And all of this was predicted before it even happened by a God who sees the end from the beginning (<a>Isaiah 46:10</a>)!

              How shall we escape, if we neglect so great salvation; which at the first began to be spoken by the Lord, and was <em>confirmed unto us by them that heard him</em>. <cite><b>Hebrews 2:3</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> Once Jesus died and ascended to heaven, His earthly ministry ended, but He confirmed the covenant, to save His people from their sins (<a>Hebrews 10:16, 17</a>), through His disciples, whom He sent to preach to the Jewish nation first (<a>Matthew 10:5, 6</a>) because they still had three and a half years remaining as part of their 490-year opportunity to repent from their sins. This period came to an end in A.D. 34, three and a half years after Jesus’ death, when the testimony of Stephen was rejected by the Jewish religious leaders, and he ended up being stoned to death (<a>Acts 7:54-60</a>). This final, collective rejection of God’s plan to save them meant that the Jews could no longer be His exclusive people, and from A.D. 34, the disciples started preaching the gospel to all the nations of the world (<a>Matthew 21:43; Acts 8:4; 13:46</a>).

            <p>
              And he said unto me, Unto two thousand and three hundred days; <em>then shall the sanctuary be cleansed</em>. <cite><b>Daniel 8:14</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              It was therefore necessary that <em>the patterns of things in the heavens should be purified with these</em>; but the heavenly things themselves with better sacrifices than these. <cite><b>Hebrews 9:23</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> After the 490 year prophecy ended in A.D. 34, there were 1,810 years remaining in the 2,300 year one (2,300 minus 490), which means it ended in 1844. According to Daniel, this was the year when the cleansing of the sanctuary began. We’ve already learned that when the system of animal sacrifices was made obsolete by the death of Jesus, the veil of the temple was torn by the divine hand of God. Shortly after, the temple itself was destroyed by the Romans in A.D. 70 and never rebuilt, so the sanctuary that is cleansed can only be the heavenly one, of which the earthly one was a symbol.
              <br><br>
              The cleansing of the earthly sanctuary always occured on the Day of Atonement (to “atone” means to be “at one” with God), which was a time of judgment during which God’s people examined their souls to make sure all of their sins were confessed, forsaken, and symbolically “blotted out” from the sanctuary (see question 13 of “Finding Hope in the Sanctuary”); likewise, the heavenly judgment began in 1844 and the sins of God’s people began to be removed from the books of heaven (<a>Daniel 7:10</a>). In other words, prior to 1844, confessed and forsaken sins were forgiven by God because of Jesus’ substitutionary sacrifice on the sinners behalf, but they remained on the books. After 1844, when the heavenly judgment began, God started to blot out even the very record of those confessed sins (<a>Acts 3:19</a>)!

            <h2>What happens at the end of the 2,300 year prophecy?</h2>
            <p>
              And I saw another angel fly in the midst of heaven, having the everlasting gospel to preach unto them that dwell on the earth, and to every nation, and kindred, and tongue, and people, saying with a loud voice, Fear God, and give glory to him; <em>for the hour of his judgment is come</em>: and worship him that made heaven, and earth, and the sea, and the fountains of waters. <cite><b>Revelation 14:6, 7</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              For the time is come that <em>judgment must begin at the house of God</em>: and if it first begin at us, what shall the end be of them that obey not the gospel of God? <cite><b>1 Peter 4:17</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> The heavenly judgment that began in 1844 is the “pre-advent judgment,” the first phase, since it occurs before the second coming of Christ. Jesus returns with His reward (<a>Revelation 22:11, 12</a>), which means those who are saved have been identified and their reward determined. Just like in the earthly Day of Atonement judgment there was a separation of the unrepentant from the camp of Israel before sin was removed from the sanctuary (<a>Leviticus 23:29</a>), so in the heavenly sanctuary there is an identification of who is saved and who is lost during the pre-advent judgment before sin is removed from the universe (see question 15).
              <br><br>
              This is why Peter says the judgment begins with the “house of God,” meaning the people of God. Anyone who has claimed to be a Christian, alive or dead, will be examined during this judgment. And it’s already in session, which is why we are called to put away our sins and be “at one” with God. We are the temple of God now that there is no longer an earthly sanctuary. It’s us that God wants to cleanse from sin because His desire is to abide in us through His Holy Spirit (<a>1 Corinthians 6:19, 20</a>).

              Do ye not know that <em>the saints shall judge the world</em>? and if the world shall be judged by you, are ye unworthy to judge the smallest matters? Know ye not that <em>we shall judge angels</em>? how much more things that pertain to this life? <cite><b>1 Corinthians 6:3</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              And I saw thrones, and they sat upon them, and <em>judgment was given unto them</em>: and I saw the souls of them that were beheaded for the witness of Jesus, and for the word of God, and which had not worshipped the beast, neither his image, neither had received his mark upon their foreheads, or in their hands; and they lived and reigned with Christ a thousand years. <cite><b>Revelation 20:4</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> After Jesus takes the saved to heaven, they will participate in the second phase of the judgment (see “1,000 Years of Peace”), during which the life of every lost person, including Satan and his angels, will be examined and all questions will be answered. Ultimately, the saved will agree that Jesus’ judgments were not arbitrary, but just and true (<a>Revelation 15:3</a>). They will see that Jesus only confirms the decision that has already been made in a person’s heart to either serve Him or another (<a>Revelation 22:11, 12</a>).

            <h2>When is the third phase of the judgment?</h2>
            <p>
              And I saw a great white throne, and him that sat on it, from whose face the earth and the heaven fled away; and there was found no place for them. And I<em> saw the dead, small and great, stand before God</em>; and the books were opened: and another book was opened, which is the book of life: and <em>the dead were judged out of those things which were written in the books, according to their works</em>. <cite><b>Revelation 20:11, 12</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              For <em>we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ</em>; that every one may receive the things done in his body, according to that he hath done, whether it be good or bad. <cite><b>2 Corinthians 5:10</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              But why dost thou judge thy brother? or why dost thou set at nought thy brother? for <em>we shall all stand before the judgment seat of Christ</em>. For it is written, As I live, saith the Lord, every knee shall bow to me, and every tongue shall confess to God. So then <em>every one of us shall give account of himself to God</em>. <cite><b>Romans 14:10-12</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> The third phase of the judgment is for the lost of all ages, and it takes place after the 1,000 years (see questions 12-14 of “1,000 Years of Peace”). Every lost soul will look back on his or her life and remember God’s patient calls to repentance&mdash;the numerous convictions of the Holy Spirit that were repeatedly refused. The books will be opened and God’s attempts to save every person will be made plain. The lost will understand that God did everything He could to save them, and every person will fall on their knees, including Satan and his angels, in confession that God has been just and fair in His dealing with every soul (<a>Philippians 2:10, 11; Romans 14:11</a>). The lost will realize they can only blame their own resistance to God’s pleadings of mercy (<a>Hosea 13:9</a>), and they acknowledge His love, mercy, and justice, clearing Him of all false accusations.

            <h2>What happens next?</h2>
            <p>
               And they went up on the breadth of the earth, and compassed the camp of the saints about, and the beloved city: and <em>fire came down from God out of heaven, and devoured them</em>. And the <em>devil that deceived them was cast into the lake of fire</em> and brimstone, where the beast and the false prophet are, and shall be tormented day and night for ever and ever. <cite><b>Revelation 20:9, 10</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> In the end, God will honor the choices of Satan, his angels, and all people who joined his rebellion and rejected His mercy (<a>Revelation 22:11, 12</a>). In order to cleanse the universe from sin, and because life cannot exist apart from the Life-Giver, the lives of those who chose to cling to sin, despite receiving numerous opportunities to be cleansed from it, will come to an end in the fire that will fall from heaven.
              <br><br>
              Ultimately, this is an act of mercy because sin only leads to pain, suffering, and sorrow; nevertheless, the act will bring immeasurable anguish to the heart of God (<a>Ezekiel 33:11</a>) because these are people whom He loved so much that He sent His only Son to die for them (<a>John 3:16</a>). No doubt Jesus will weep over those whom He wanted to save. Guardian angels will likely weep over the ones they served to protect. It will be a time of immense sorrow for the saved as well because it’s likely many will have a loved one in the fire. The good news is the fire does not burn forever (see “Is Hell Forever?”). The pain and suffering will come to an end, and God will create a new earth on which He will dwell with His people (<a>Revelation 21:1-5</a>). The harmony that existed between Adam, Eve, and their Creator will be restored, and sin will never rise up again (<a>Nahum 1:9</a>)!

            <h2>What is the good news about the judgment?</h2>
            <p>
              There is therefore now <em>no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus</em>, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit. <cite><b>Romans 8:1</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              <em>If we confess our sins</em>, he is faithful and just to <em>forgive us</em> our sins, and to <em>cleanse us</em> from all unrighteousness. <cite><b>1 John 1:9</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> The judgment has been in session since 1844, and even though it may seem like a dreadful thing to many, it’s actually full of good news: <br>
              &emsp; &bull; The central purpose of the judgment is to vindicate God’s character and government before the universe, because Lucifer, in his rebellion, suggested that, if given the chance, he would establish a better form of government than God (see “Origin of Evil”), but in the end, every human and angel, including Satan, will bow in confession that God’s ways are love, mercy, and justice (<a>Philippians 2:10, 11; Revelation 15:3</a>). <br>
              &emsp; &bull; The judgment is declared in favor of God’s people (<a>Daniel 7:21, 22</a>) because all of their sins have been confessed, forgiven, and cleansed by Jesus (<a>1 John 1:9</a>); there is no condemnation to those who are in Christ (<a>Romans 8:1</a>). <br>
              &emsp; &bull; Those who rejected God’s mercy will not be tortured in hell endlessly (<a>Malachi 4:1</a>). <br>
              &emsp; &bull; Jesus presides as Judge (<a>John 5:22</a>); He is also the Advocate and the Witness for the saved (<a>1 John 2:1; Revelation 3:14</a>). With Jesus on my side, I have nothing to fear. <br>
              &emsp; &bull; The Father and the Son want every person to be saved (<a>John 3:16; 13:1; 1 Timothy 2:3, 4</a>); Satan is our only accusser (<a>Revelation 12:10</a>).
              <br><br>
              The judgment revolves around the atonement, being “at one” or reconciled with God, and Jesus is in the center of it all! He is the only One who can remove sin from our lives (<a>Acts 4:12</a>). If you haven’t done so, now is the time to get right with God and accept Jesus as Lord and Savior (<a>2 Corinthians 6:2</a>). God is still offering forgiveness and mercy to those who come to His throne (<a>Hebrews 4:14-16; 7:25</a>), and Jesus is still knocking (<a>Revelation 3:20</a>).

            <h2>How does the Bible describe the law of God?</h2>
            <p>
              The works of his hands are verity and judgment; all his commandments are sure. <em>They stand fast for ever and ever</em>, and are <em>done in truth and uprightness</em>. <cite><b>Psalm 111:7, 8</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              The law of the LORD is <em>perfect</em>, converting the soul: the testimony of the LORD is <em>sure</em>, making wise the simple. The statutes of the LORD are <em>right</em>, rejoicing the heart: the commandment of the LORD is <em>pure</em>, enlightening the eyes. <cite><b>Psalm 19:7, 8</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> Every government has laws to ensure order and protection for its citizens. It is no different with the King of the universe and His government, except His law is eternal, true, upright, perfect, sure, right, and pure. God’s dominion knows no bounds, and His law, therefore, is universal as well, so even though it’s mostly neglected on earth, it is still binding.

            <h2>Does it have a role to play in my life?</h2>
            <p>
              The fear of the LORD is clean, enduring for ever: the judgments of the LORD are true and righteous altogether. More to be desired are they than gold, yea, than much fine gold: sweeter also than honey and the honeycomb. Moreover <em>by them is thy servant warned: and in keeping of them there is great reward</em>. <cite><b>Psalm 19:9-11</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              And the LORD commanded us to do all these statutes, to fear the LORD our God, <em>for our good always, that he might preserve us alive</em>, as it is at this day. <cite><b>Deuteronomy 6:24</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              My son, forget not my law; but let thine heart keep my commandments: <em>for length of days, and long life, and peace, shall they add to thee</em>. <cite><b>Proverbs 3:1, 2</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              Let us hear the conclusion of the whole matter: <em>fear God, and keep his commandments: for this is the whole duty of man</em>. <cite><b>Ecclesiastes 12:13</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> Satan rebelled against God’s law in heaven because he didn’t want to be restricted by it, and when Adam and Even believed his lie about defining good and evil for themselves (<a>Genesis 3:5</a>), his lawless kingdom took over earth as well. Our Creator God defines good and evil for us in His law because He knows what’s best for us better than we will ever know ourselves. And His law is not a restriction; it’s there to be a blessing, to protect us from evils, such as murder, adultery, theft, and falsehood, ensuring a happy and harmonious existence for all.

            <h2>How else does the law affect me?</h2>
            <p>
              If ye fulfil the royal law according to the scripture, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself, ye do well: But if ye have respect to persons, ye commit sin, and are convinced of the law as transgressors. <em>For whosoever shall keep the whole law, and yet offend in one point, he is guilty of all</em>. For he that said, Do not commit adultery, said also, Do not kill. Now if thou commit no adultery, yet if thou kill, <em>thou art become a transgressor of the law</em>. So speak ye, and so do, as they that shall be judged by the law of liberty. <cite><b>James 2:8-12</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              For as many as are of the works of the law are under the curse: for it is written, <em>Cursed is every one that continueth not in all things which are written in the book of the law to do them</em>. <cite><b>Galatians 3:10</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              But we are all as an unclean thing, and <em>all our righteousnesses are as filthy rags</em>; and we all do fade as a leaf; and our iniquities, like the wind, have taken us away. <cite><b>Isaiah 64:6</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> When James is talking about the law, he is referring to the Ten Commandments, and he actually says it’s not enough to keep some or even most of them. Breaking even one is breaking them all. Consequently, there is no human being who hasn’t been condemned by the law, which is the standard during the judgment (see “Is There a Judgment?”).

            <h2>Does God leave me in my condemned state?</h2>
            <p>
              But that no man is justified by the law in the sight of God, it is evident: for, <em>The just shall live by faith</em>.  <cite><b>Galatians 3:11</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              For sin shall not have dominion over you: for <em>ye are not under the law, but under grace</em>. <cite><b>Romans 6:14</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              Being justified freely by his grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus: whom God hath set forth to be a propitiation through faith in his blood, to declare his righteousness for the remission of sins that are past, through the forbearance of God; to declare, I say, at this time his righteousness: that he might be just, and the justifier of him which believeth in Jesus. Where is boasting then? It is excluded. By what law? of works? Nay: but by the law of faith. Therefore we conclude that a <em>man is justified by faith without the deeds of the law</em>. <cite><b>Romans 3:24-28</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> Because Jesus is the Creator God, He was able to take the condemnation of the law on Himself at the cross, on behalf of all humanity, so that every person who accepts Him by faith in His substitutionary sacrifice could stand before the law clothed in His perfectly righteous life!

          <section>
            <div>5</div>
            <h2>Does that mean we are now free to break it?</h2>
            <p>
              Therefore we conclude that a man is justified by faith without the deeds of the law. Is he the God of the Jews only? Is he not also of the Gentiles? Yes, of the Gentiles also: seeing it is one God, which shall justify the circumcision by faith, and uncircumcision through faith. <em>Do we then make void the law through faith? God forbid: yea, we establish the law</em>. <cite><b>Romans 3:28-31</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              What then? shall we sin, because we are not under the law, but under grace? <em>God forbid</em>. <cite><b>Romans 6:15</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              Think not that I am come to destroy the law, or the prophets: <em>I am not come to destroy, but to fulfil</em>. For verily I say unto you, Till heaven and earth pass, one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law, till all be fulfilled. <cite><b>Matthew 5:17, 18</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> If you were caught speeding and the police officer wanted to give you a hefty fine, but decided to give you a warning instead, would you then go screeching out back on the highway to break the speed limit again? No, you would carefully watch your speed. Jesus’ death on the cross was an act of mercy and forgiveness for those who accept it, not a license to live lawlessly.

            </p>
            <p>
              Therefore by the deeds of the law there shall no flesh be justified in his sight: for <em>by the law is the knowledge of sin</em>. <cite><b>Romans 3:20</b></cite>

            <h2>What does sin do?</h2>
            <p>
              Behold, the LORD'S hand is not shortened, that it cannot save; neither his ear heavy, that it cannot hear: But <em>your iniquities have separated between you and your God</em>, and your sins have hid his face from you, that he will not hear. <cite><b>Isaiah 59:1, 2</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              <em>For the wages of sin is death</em>; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord. <cite><b>Romans 6:23</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> Sin cannot exist in the presence of a holy God because at the root of sin is selfishness, which is abhorent to God’s character of love. As a result, sin creates separation between me and God, the Giver of life, and leads to eternal death if left untreated.

            <h2>What is the motivation for keeping His law?</h2>
            <p>
              <em>If ye love me</em>, keep my commandments. <cite><b>John 14:15</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              For <em>this is the love of God, that we keep his commandments</em>: and his commandments are not grievous. <cite><b>1 John 5:3</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              Then one of them, which was a lawyer, asked him a question, tempting him, and saying, Master, which is the great commandment in the law? Jesus said unto him, <em>Thou shalt love the Lord thy God</em> with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind. This is the first and great commandment. And the second is like unto it, <em>Thou shalt love thy neighbour</em> as thyself. <em>On these two commandments hang all the law</em> and the prophets. <cite><b>Matthew 22:35-40</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              Love worketh no ill to his neighbour: therefore <em>love is the fulfilling of the law</em>. <cite><b>Romans 13:10</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> Since selfishness is at the root of sin, and sin is the breaking of His law, then the law is really a law of love, dealing with my relationship with God (the first four commandments) and my neighbor (the last six). That’s why Jesus said that the entire law hangs on loving God and loving my neighbor. When there is genuine love present in a relationship then pleasing that person ceases to become a burden; in fact, without love for Jesus it’s not possible to keep His law.

            <h2>What is one of the purposes of the law?</h2>
            <p>
              He who says, “I know Him,” and does not keep His commandments, is a liar, and the truth is not in him. But whoever keeps His word, truly the love of God is perfected in him. <em>By this we know that we are in Him</em>. <cite><b>1 John 2:4, 5, NKJV</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              Not every one that saith unto me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of heaven; but <em>he that doeth the will of my Father which is in heaven</em>. Many will say to me in that day, Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied in thy name? and in thy name have cast out devils? and in thy name done many wonderful works? And then will I profess unto them, <em>I never knew you: depart from me, ye that work iniquity</em>. <cite><b>Matthew 7:21-23</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              The <em>heart is deceitful above all things</em>, and desperately wicked: who can know it? <em>I the LORD search the heart</em>, I try the reins, even to give every man according to his ways, and according to the fruit of his doings. <cite><b>Jeremiah 17:9, 10</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              O LORD, <em>thou hast searched me, and known me</em>. Thou knowest my downsitting and mine uprising, thou understandest my thought afar off. Thou compassest my path and my lying down, and <em>art acquainted with all my ways</em>. For there is not a word in my tongue, but, lo, O LORD, thou knowest it altogether. <cite><b>Psalm 139:1-4</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> God knows me better than I know myself, and He knows if I truly love Him. The Ten Commandments are really a mirror for me that shows my genuine condition; they provide evidence letting me know if I truly love Him because it can be easy to deceive myself. Jesus says there will be people who served Him and thought they loved Him, but their lawlessness will say otherwise.

A new heart also will I give you, and a new spirit will I put within you: and I will take away the stony heart out of your flesh, and I will give you an heart of flesh. <em>And I will put my spirit within you, and cause you to walk in my statutes, and ye shall keep my judgments, and do them</em>. <cite><b>Ezekiel 36:25-27</b></cite>

              <b>Note:</b> God promises to help me keep His commandments because He knows that I cannot overcome sin myself. But He does not force Himself on anyone, so I must ask, and the promise is He will write His law in my heart and mind, enabling me to walk in His commandments through the power of the Holy Spirit dwelling in me! If I believe that He will keep this promise, He will do it according to my faith, and He will make it a delight to do His will because He will write the law in my heart! The only one who can create a new heart in me is the One who created the world in Eden.

            </p>
            <p>
              Jesus replied, “And <em>why do you break the command of God for the sake of your tradition</em>? ... Thus you nullify the word of God for the sake of your tradition. You hypocrites! Isaiah prophesied correctly about you: ‘These people honor Me with their lips, but their hearts are far from Me. <em>They worship Me in vain; they teach as doctrine the precepts of men</em>.’ <cite><b>Matthew 15:3, 6-9</b></cite>
            </p>

              <b>Note:</b> The devil’s war against God and His law started in the courts of heaven and has been raging ever since here on Earth. Is it any surprise that the devil would try to persuade people that God's law is no longer binding and even go as far as persecuting those who keep it?

            <h2>Which commandment identifies the Creator God?</h2>
            <p>
              Remember the sabbath day, to keep it holy. Six days shalt thou labour, and do all thy work: but the seventh day is the sabbath of the LORD thy God: in it thou shalt not do any work, thou, nor thy son, nor thy daughter, thy manservant, nor thy maidservant, nor thy cattle, nor thy stranger that is within thy gates: <em>for in six days the LORD made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that in them is, and rested the seventh day</em>: wherefore the LORD blessed the sabbath day, and hallowed it. <cite><b>Exodus 20:8-11</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> The fourth commandment begins with the word “remember” because God knew His Sabbath would be forgotten. It also identifies God as the Creator of everything, and every created human being is invited to show his or her acknowledgment of this by resting on the Sabbath day, just like He rested on the seventh day as an example for us. The fourth commandment also identifies God as the author of the other nine and gives the reason for His authority&mdash;Creator of heaven and earth. In other words, the whole Decalogue gets its authority from the fourth commandment; remove it, and anyone could have given the other nine. Without the fourth commandment the entire Decalogue loses its authority over human life.

            <h2>What else can I learn about the Sabbath from Genesis 2?</h2>
            <p>
              Thus the heavens and the earth were finished, and all the host of them. And on the seventh day God ended his work which he had made; and he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had made. And <em>God blessed the seventh day, and sanctified it</em>: because that in it he had rested from all his work which God created and made. <cite><b>Genesis 2:1-3</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> The reason why the fourth commandment invites me to keep the Sabbath day holy is because God blessed this specific day and sanctified it. The word used in the original text is “qadash,” which means “to be set apart or consecrated.” In other words, the seventh day, is special to God and unlike any of the other six days of the week.

            <h2>Why was it given to us?</h2>
            <p>
              Moreover also I gave them my sabbaths, <em>to be a sign</em> between me and them, that they <em>might know that I am the LORD that sanctify them</em>. ... And hallow my sabbaths; and they shall be a sign between me and you, <em>that ye may know that I am the LORD your God</em>. <cite><b>Ezekiel 20:12, 20</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> The Sabbath is a sign of my acknowledgment that 1) God is Lord of the universe because He created it in six literal days (<a>Exodus 20:8, 11</a>) and 2) He is Lord of my life because He’s the One who redeems and sanctifies me. In Eden God rested on the seventh day from His word of creation, and in the tomb Jesus rested on the same day from His work of redemption. Thus the Sabbath is a memorial of these two things, a weekly rest in Jesus where despite having a plethora of things to do, I still put them aside to connect with and honor Him. The Sabbath is also a beautiful weekly reminder that I am saved by faith in His completed work on the cross, instead of my own works.

              And that day was the preparation, and <em>the sabbath drew on</em>. And the women also, which came with him from Galilee, followed after, and beheld the sepulchre, and how his body was laid.

            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> The Bible is clear that His followers kept the Sabbath. In fact, they even stopped their work of anointing His body in order to keep it according to the commandment. They ended up coming back on Sunday, the first day of the week, after the Sabbath was over, to finish their work.

The Sabbath is a day of rest from works, and as such, it is a beautiful symbol of righteousness by faith as we are saved by the righteousness of Jesus, not our works.

            <h2>What does Isaiah say about those who keep the Sabbath?</h2>
            <p>
              <em>Blessed is the man</em> that doeth this, and the son of man that layeth hold on it; that keepeth the sabbath from polluting it, and keepeth his hand from doing any evil. <cite><b>Isaiah 56:2</b></cite>

            <h2>Is this confirmed elsewhere?</h2>
            <p>
              For in six days the LORD made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that in them is, and rested the seventh day: wherefore <em>the LORD blessed the sabbath day</em>, and hallowed it. <cite><b>Exodus 20:11</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              And it shall come to pass, if thou shalt hearken diligently unto the voice of the LORD thy God, to observe and to do all his commandments which I command thee this day, that the LORD thy God will set thee on high above all nations of the earth: and <em>all these blessings shall come on thee, and overtake thee</em>, if thou shalt hearken unto the voice of the LORD thy God. ... But it shall come to pass, if thou wilt not hearken unto the voice of the LORD thy God, to observe to do all his commandments and his statutes which I command thee this day; that all these curses shall come upon thee, and overtake thee. <cite><b>Deuteronomy 28:1, 2, 15</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> The Sabbath was not made to be a burden, but a blessing to the human race, and those who keep it partake in the blessing on a weekly basis. In Deuteronomy 28 God also pronounces other blessings on those who keep His commandments, including the fourth.

            <h2>How is the Sabbath to be kept?</h2>
            <p>
              Remember the sabbath day, to keep it holy. Six days shalt thou labour, and do all thy work: but the seventh day is the sabbath of the LORD thy God: in it <em>thou shalt not do any work, thou, nor thy son, nor thy daughter, thy manservant, nor thy maidservant, nor thy cattle, nor thy stranger that is within thy gates</em>: for in six days the LORD made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that in them is, and rested the seventh day: wherefore the LORD blessed the sabbath day, and hallowed it. <cite><b>Exodus 20:8-11</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> The Sabbath was instituted to provide rest and refuge in and through Christ. It’s a special weekly blessing to everyone who chooses to rest from their works by trusting in Him. We may have a long list of things to do, but we can still put them aside in order to have time to connect with God and acknowledge His supremacy in our lives. This rest from work extends to everyone “within our gates” or under our authority.

            <p class="note">

            <p>
              It is to be a Sabbath of complete rest for you, and you shall humble yourselves; on the ninth of the month at evening, <em>from evening until evening</em>, you shall keep your Sabbath. <cite><b>Leviticus 23:32, NASB</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              And God called the light Day, and the darkness he called Night. And <em>the evening and the morning were the first day</em>. <cite><b>Genesis 1:5</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> In the Bible, the day does not actually start and end at midnight; it starts from sunset and lasts until the next day’s sunset. In the Genesis account each day includes the prior evening as well, so since the Sabbath is the seventh day of the week, it would start from sunset on Friday and last until sunset on Saturday.

            <h2>What insight does Isaiah give?</h2>
            <p>
              If thou turn away thy foot from the sabbath, from doing thy pleasure on my holy day; and <em>call the sabbath a delight</em>, the holy of the LORD, honourable; and <em>shalt honour him, not doing thine own ways, nor finding thine own pleasure, nor speaking thine own words</em>: then shalt thou <em>delight thyself in the LORD</em>; and I will cause thee to ride upon the high places of the earth, and feed thee with the heritage of Jacob thy father: for the mouth of the LORD hath spoken it. <cite><b>Isaiah 58:13, 14</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> The Sabbath becomes a delight when it is centered around Jesus&mdash;when we put away our own pursuits and rest from the cares of life in order to focus on the eternal things of God. It’s a special day to reflect on, honor, and connect with Him. Simply put, it’s a day to delight in Him.

            <h2>What can we learn from the experience of Nehemiah?</h2>
            <p>
              In those days <em>saw I in Judah some treading wine presses on the sabbath, and bringing in sheaves, and lading asses; as also wine, grapes, and figs, and all manner of burdens, which they brought into Jerusalem on the sabbath day</em>: and I testified against them in the day wherein they sold victuals. There dwelt men of Tyre also therein, which brought fish, and all manner of ware, and <em>sold on the sabbath</em> unto the children of Judah, and in Jerusalem. Then I contended with the nobles of Judah, and said unto them, What evil thing is this that ye do, and profane the sabbath day? Did not your fathers thus, and did not our God bring all this evil upon us, and upon this city? yet ye bring more wrath upon Israel by profaning the sabbath.
              <br><br>
              And it came to pass, that when the gates of Jerusalem began to be dark before the sabbath, I commanded that the gates should be shut, and charged that they should not be opened till after the sabbath: and some of my servants set I at the gates, that there should no burden be brought in on the sabbath day. So the merchants and sellers of all kind of ware lodged without Jerusalem once or twice. Then I testified against them, and said unto them, Why lodge ye about the wall? if ye do so again, I will lay hands on you. <em>From that time forth came they no more on the sabbath. And I commanded the Levites that they should cleanse themselves, and that they should come and keep the gates, to sanctify the sabbath day</em>.<cite><b>Nehemiah 13:15-22</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> We can clearly see that buying, selling, and conducting business to generate income are activities that profane the Sabbath day. Now this can pose a challenge for some professions; it wouldn’t be right to abandon people requiring medical care on the Sabbath, for example, but as far as it is possible, we should seek to rest from income-generating work in order to honor our Creator.

            <h2>What activities are encouraged on the Sabbath?</h2>
            <p>
              And he said unto them, What man shall there be among you, that shall have one sheep, and if it fall into a pit on the sabbath day, will he not lay hold on it, and lift it out? How much then is a man better than a sheep? Wherefore <em>it is lawful to do well on the sabbath days</em>. Then saith he to the man, Stretch forth thine hand. And he stretched it forth; and it was restored whole, like as the other. <cite><b>Matthew 12:11-13</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> Jesus continued to heal people on the Sabbath, contrary to the tradition of the religious leaders of that day. Ministering to the sick, the needy, and the discouraged by relieving their suffering, whether physical, emotional, or spiritual, is what makes the Sabbath a delight.

            <h2>For whom was the Sabbath instituted?</h2>
            <p>
              And it came to pass, that he went through the corn fields on the sabbath day; and his disciples began, as they went, to pluck the ears of corn. And the Pharisees said unto him, Behold, why do they on the sabbath day that which is not lawful? And he said unto them, Have ye never read what David did, when he had need, and was an hungred, he, and they that were with him? How he went into the house of God in the days of Abiathar the high priest, and did eat the shewbread, which is not lawful to eat but for the priests, and gave also to them which were with him? And he said unto them, <em>The sabbath was made for man, and not man for the sabbath</em>: therefore the Son of man is Lord also of the sabbath. <cite><b>Mark 2:23-28</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> The Pharisees had so many additional man-made rules to ensure the Sabbath was kept holy that they turned it into a burden, but Jesus did not follow these rules. He only followed God’s rules, which are there to ensure the Sabbath is a delight. In fact, He made it quite clear that the Sabbath was made for us, and not the other way around.

            <p>
              And the LORD said unto Moses, How long refuse ye to keep my commandments and my laws? See, for that the LORD hath given you the sabbath, therefore <em>he giveth you on the sixth day the bread of two days</em>; abide ye every man in his place, let no man go out of his place on the seventh day. So the people rested on the seventh day. <cite><b>Exodus 16:28-30</b></cite>

            <p>
              Wherefore the LORD God of Israel saith, I said indeed that thy house, and the house of thy father, should walk before me for ever: but now the LORD saith, Be it far from me; <em>for them that honour me I will honour</em>, and they that despise me shall be lightly esteemed. <cite><b>1 Samuel 2:30</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> It may be tempting to worry about lost income on the Sabbath, but just as God miraculously provided a double portion of bread for the Israelites on Friday to ensure they had enough for Saturday, He will also provide for our needs today when we choose to honor Him by resting on His holy day.

It is a sign between me and the children of Israel <em>for ever</em>: for in six days the LORD made heaven and earth, and on the seventh day he rested, and was refreshed.

              <b>Note:</b> The Ten Commandments, which the Sabbath is a part of, were written by the finger of God on tablets of stone, instead of a material subject to decay, like wood or clay, as a testament to their timelessness. This is in contrast to Jesus writing the sins of the woman caught in adultery in the dust (<a>John 8:1-11</a>), as a beautiful testament to God’s willingness to forgive anyone who repents.

            <p>
              Thus the heavens and the earth were finished, and all the host of them. And on the seventh day God ended his work which he had made; and <em>he rested on the seventh day</em> from all his work which he had made. And <em>God blessed the seventh day, and sanctified it</em>: because that in it he had rested from all his work which God created and made. <cite><b>Genesis 2:1-3</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              For as the new heavens and the new earth, which I will make, shall remain before me, saith the LORD, so shall your seed and your name remain. And it shall come to pass, that from one new moon to another, and <em>from one sabbath to another, shall all flesh come to worship before me</em>, saith the LORD. <cite><b>Isaiah 66:22, 23</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> The seventh day Sabbath, from Friday sunset to Saturday sunset, was set apart, blessed, and sanctified on the very first week of creation, long before there was a Jewish nation, and it will be kept even in heaven.

            <h2>What does the Bible say about unbelief and the seventh day?</h2>
            <p>
              For he spake in a certain place of the seventh day on this wise, and God did rest the seventh day from all his works. And in this place again, If they shall enter into my rest. Seeing therefore it remaineth that some must enter therein, and <em>they to whom it was first preached entered not in because of unbelief</em> ... There remaineth therefore a rest to the people of God. For he that is entered into his rest, he also hath ceased from his own works, as God did from his. <em>Let us labour therefore to enter into that rest, lest any man fall after the same example of unbelief</em>. <cite><b>Hebrews 4:4-6, 9-11</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> The book of Hebrews says there was unbelief about resting on the seventh day, but to deny this day is to deny salvation by faith. Because I cannot sanctify or save myself, I am invited to cease from trying to be saved by my own works and rest in the righteous life of Jesus on my behalf. Resting on the seventh day of the week, as God did in <a>Genesis 2:1-3</a>, is an acknowledgment of this sublime truth.

            </p>
            <p>
              In the end of the sabbath, as it began to dawn toward the <em>first day of the week, came Mary Magdalene and the other Mary to see the sepulchre</em>. <cite><b>Matthew 28:1</b></cite>
            </p>

            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> Jesus’ followers were so concerned about the Sabbath that they even stopped their labor of love in preparing His body for burial, kept the Sabbath, and returned to resume their unfinished work early Sunday morning. Notice there is no mention of them keeping the first day, Sunday, holy in honor of Jesus’ resurrection, nor is there a command by Jesus to do so. When He appeared to Mary Magdalene that morning there was no talk of Sunday keeping at all.

There is only one commandment that is both a time and a law: the fourth one. The first seeds for its change were planted during Constantine’s conversion to Christianity in 312 A.D. when he passed a law declaring Sunday, which was the pagan day of sun worship, as the day of rest across the Roman Empire. That seed took root in 363 A.D. when the Council of Laodicea urged Christians to keep Sunday as their rest day, while prohibiting them from resting on Saturday, the seventh day Sabbath, and the rest is history.

            <h2>Did Jesus warn about this?</h2>
            <p>
              Thus have <em>ye made the commandment of God of none effect by your tradition</em>. Ye hypocrites, well did Esaias prophesy of you, saying, This people draweth nigh unto me with their mouth, and honoureth me with their lips; but their heart is far from me. But in vain they do worship me, <em>teaching for doctrines the commandments of men</em>. <cite><b>Matthew 15:6-9</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> The elevation of human-made commandments and tradition above the truth of the Bible was already a problem in Jesus’ time, and He warned against such hypocrisy.

            <h2>What role will the law play in the last days?</h2>
            <p>
              And after these things I saw four angels standing on the four corners of the earth, holding the four winds of the earth, that the wind should not blow on the earth, nor on the sea, nor on any tree. And I saw another angel ascending from the east, having the seal of the living God: and he cried with a loud voice to the four angels, to whom it was given to hurt the earth and the sea, saying, Hurt not the earth, neither the sea, nor the trees, <em>till we have sealed the servants of our God in their foreheads</em>. <cite><b>Revelation 7:1-3</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              Bind up the testimony, <em>seal the law</em> among my disciples. <cite><b>Isaiah 8:16</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> In the last days there will be a sealing of God’s people in their foreheads, and Isaiah says it’s the law that’s sealed among His people. The sealing of the law in the forehead is God’s people making an unwavering decision in their mind to honor the authority of God’s law in their life as supreme and above the laws of men, no matter the cost.

            <h2>What is said about the saints?</h2>
            <p>
              Saying with a loud voice, Fear God, and give glory to him; for the hour of his judgment is come: and <em>worship him that made heaven, and earth, and the sea, and the fountains of waters</em>. ... Here is the patience of the saints: here are <em>they that keep the commandments of God, and the faith of Jesus</em>. <cite><b>Revelation 14:7, 12</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> There will be a call in the last days to worship God, the Creator of the universe, which implies there will be another power vying to be worshiped as well. This call is a reference to the last part of the fourth commandment where keeping the Sabbath is identified as a sign and an acknowledgment that God is the Creator of all. Could the worship of God by keeping His seventh day Sabbath constitute the seal of God in the last days? Verse 12 leaves no room for doubt when it says the saints will be keeping the faith of Jesus, who kept the seventh day Sabbath, and the commandments of God, which include the fourth. May we be found faithful in our stand for Jesus.

            </p>
            <p>
              And the very God of peace <em>sanctify you wholly</em>; and I pray God <em>your whole spirit and soul and body be preserved blameless</em> unto the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ. <cite><b>1 Thessalonians 5:23</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              And when he saw their faith, he said unto him, Man, <em>thy sins are forgiven thee</em>. ... But that ye may know that the Son of man hath power upon earth to forgive sins, (he said unto the sick of the palsy,) <em>I say unto thee, Arise, and take up thy couch</em>, and go into thine house. <cite><b>Luke 5:20, 24</b></cite>

            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> Jesus wants to sanctify me wholly, including mind, body, and spirit. He did not just forgive the sins of the paralytic, but He also healed him from the disease, and He wants the same complete healing for me as well.

For ye are bought with a price</em>: therefore glorify God in your body, and in your spirit, which are God's. <cite><b>1 Corinthians 6:19, 20</b></cite>

            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> My body belongs to God because 1) He created it, and 2) He redeemed it at the cross. It is to be a temple of the Holy Spirit, enabling me to bring Him glory in my body and spirit!

              I beseech you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God, <em>that ye present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God</em>, which is your reasonable service. And be not conformed to this world: but <em>be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind</em>, that ye may prove what is that good, and acceptable, and perfect, will of God. <cite><b>Romans 12:1, 2</b></cite>

              Whether therefore ye eat, or drink, or <em>whatsoever ye do, do all to the glory of God</em>. <cite><b>1 Corinthians 10:31</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              But <em>my God shall supply all your need</em> according to his riches in glory by Christ Jesus. <cite><b>Philippians 3:19</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              <em>Ask, and it shall be given you</em>; seek, and ye shall find; knock, and it shall be opened unto you: for every one that asketh receiveth; and he that seeketh findeth; and to him that knocketh it shall be opened. <cite><b>Matthew 7:7, 8</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> Paul invites me to bring God glory in everything that I do, including the things I eat and drink. This is a high standard that I cannot reach in my own power, but God has made ample provision for this to become a reality in my life by the grace and power of Christ, as long as I do not frustrate His grace with a perverse will. If I ask Jesus to help me live a life that glorifies Him then He will gladly answer that prayer. And because God is love (<a>1 John 4:8</a>), His glory is my good.

            <h2>What does the Bible say about alcohol?</h2>
            <p>
              <em>Wine is a mocker, strong drink is raging</em>: and whosoever is deceived thereby is not wise. <cite><b>Proverbs 20:1</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              Who hath woe? who hath sorrow? who hath contentions? who hath babbling? who hath wounds without cause? who hath redness of eyes? They that tarry long at the wine; they that go to seek mixed wine. <em>Look not thou upon the wine</em> when it is red, when it giveth his colour in the cup, when it moveth itself aright. <em>At the last it biteth like a serpent, and stingeth like an adder</em>. <cite><b>Proverbs 23:29-32</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              <em>Woe unto them</em> that rise up early in the morning, <em>that they may follow strong drink</em>; that continue until night, till wine inflame them! <cite><b>Isaiah 5:11</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              For they eat the bread of wickedness, and <em>drink the wine of violence</em>. <cite><b>Proverbs 4:17</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> The Bible is clear and direct in its condemnation of wine and other alcoholic beverages, and science is now agreeing too. Studies have shown that alcohol is toxic to the cells and no amount is actually safe. Wine does contain beneficial flavonoids that help fight free radicals in the body, but so does grape juice!

            <h2>Why should I not consume alcohol?</h2>
            <p>
              It is not for kings, O Lemuel, <em>it is not for kings to drink wine; nor for princes strong drink</em>: lest they drink, and forget the law, and pervert the judgment of any of the afflicted. <cite><b>Proverbs 31:4, 5</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              And they sung a new song, saying, Thou art worthy to take the book, and to open the seals thereof: for thou wast slain, and hast redeemed us to God by thy blood out of every kindred, and tongue, and people, and nation; and hast <em>made us unto our God kings and priests</em>: and we shall reign on the earth. <cite><b>Revelation 5:9, 10</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              Wherefore <em>gird up the loins of your mind, be sober</em>, and hope to the end for the grace that is to be brought unto you at the revelation of Jesus Christ. <cite><b>1 Peter 1:13</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              Finally, my brethren, be strong in the Lord, and in the power of his might. Put on the whole armour of God, that ye may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil. <em>For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places</em>. <cite><b>Ephesians 6:10-12</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> Proverbs plainly says that alcoholic drinks pervert the judgment, and as such, they are not suitable for kings and princes. In Revelation we learn that we are made to be kings and priests to God, which is why Peter calls us to be sober, to bind the mind for action, like a soldier binds his belt in preparation for battle, because our battle is not with flesh and blood; it’s a battle with spiritual forces, and the outcome has eternal consequences.

            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> Meat was added to the diet after the flood because when Noah stepped off the ark all the vegetation had been destroyed. But God made a distinction between clean and unclean animals because seven pairs of every clean animal came onto the ark and only two pairs of the unclean, so Noah and his family were allowed to eat every clean animal, as long as the blood was drained.

              And the LORD spake unto Moses and to Aaron, saying unto them, Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, These are the beasts which ye shall eat among all the beasts that are on the earth. <em>Whatsoever parteth the hoof, and is clovenfooted, and cheweth the cud, among the beasts, that shall ye eat</em>. Nevertheless these shall ye not eat of them that chew the cud, or of them that divide the hoof: as the camel, because he cheweth the cud, but divideth not the hoof; he is unclean unto you. And the coney, because he cheweth the cud, but divideth not the hoof; he is unclean unto you. And the hare, because he cheweth the cud, but divideth not the hoof; he is unclean unto you. And the swine, though he divide the hoof, and be clovenfooted, yet he cheweth not the cud; he is unclean to you. Of their flesh shall ye not eat, and their carcase shall ye not touch; they are unclean to you.
              <br><br>
              These shall ye eat of all that are in the waters: <em>whatsoever hath fins and scales in the waters, in the seas, and in the rivers, them shall ye eat</em>. And all that have not fins and scales in the seas, and in the rivers, of all that move in the waters, and of any living thing which is in the waters, they shall be an abomination unto you: they shall be even an abomination unto you; ye shall not eat of their flesh, but ye shall have their carcases in abomination. Whatsoever hath no fins nor scales in the waters, that shall be an abomination unto you. <cite><b>Leviticus 11:1-12</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> The unclean animals are scavengers and bottom feeders; some examples include cats, dogs, horses, camels, eagles, vultures, hogs, squirrels, rabbits, catfish, eels, lobsters, clams, crabs, shrimp, oysters, and frogs. These laws are not just for the Jewish nation because Noah was not Jewish, and they were not done away with at the cross because our physiology did not change at the cross. If these were unfit for human consumption before the cross then they are still unfit today.

              For the LORD God is a sun and shield: the LORD will give grace and glory: <em>no good thing will he withhold from them that walk uprightly</em>. <cite><b>Psalm 84:11</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              And said, If thou wilt diligently hearken to the voice of the LORD thy God, and wilt do that which is right in his sight, and wilt give ear to his commandments, and keep all his statutes, I will put none of these diseases upon thee, which I have brought upon the Egyptians: <em>for I am the LORD that healeth thee</em>. <cite><b>Exodus 15:26</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              If ye know these things, <em>happy are ye if ye do them</em>. <cite><b>John 13:17</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              Thou wilt shew me the path of life: <em>in thy presence is fulness of joy; at thy right hand there are pleasures for evermore</em>. <cite><b>Psalm 16:11</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> We are not to consume unclean animals because they are detrimental to our health. God’s mission is to bring healing into our bodies and minds, so He never withholds anything that is good for us. He is also far better at pleasure and happiness than Satan because His way does not lead to a crash after the high, or desensitization that requires increasingly higher doses, or addiction. It may seem difficult, overwhelming, or even impossible to make these dietary changes, but when I don’t have the willpower myself, I can give Him my will, and He will give me the power.

            <p>
              On the morrow, as they went on their journey, and drew nigh unto the city, Peter went up upon the housetop to pray about the sixth hour: and he became very hungry, and would have eaten: but while they made ready, he fell into a trance, and saw heaven opened, and a certain vessel descending unto him, as it had been a great sheet knit at the four corners, and let down to the earth: wherein were all manner of fourfooted beasts of the earth, and wild beasts, and creeping things, and fowls of the air. And there came a voice to him, Rise, Peter; kill, and eat. But Peter said, <em>Not so, Lord; for I have never eaten any thing that is common or unclean</em>. And the voice spake unto him again the second time, What God hath cleansed, that call not thou common. This was done thrice: and the vessel was received up again into heaven. <cite><b>Acts 10:9-16</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              And he said unto them, Ye know how that it is an unlawful thing for a man that is a Jew to keep company, or come unto one of another nation; but <em>God hath shewed me that I should not call any man common or unclean</em>. <cite><b>Acts 10:28</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> The subject of Peter’s vision was people, not animals. God was telling him that he should not view Gentiles as unclean because he was about to have Gentile visitors, whom he would have refused to see, as Jewish law forbade associating with Gentiles (<a>Acts 10:28</a>), but after receiving this vision, Peter welcomed them.

              I am sought of them that asked not for me; I am found of them that sought me not: I said, Behold me, behold me, unto a nation that was not called by my name. <em>I have spread out my hands all the day unto a rebellious people, which walketh in a way that was not good, after their own thoughts</em>; a people that provoketh me to anger continually to my face; that sacrificeth in gardens, and burneth incense upon altars of brick; which remain among the graves, and lodge in the monuments, <em>which eat swine's flesh, and broth of abominable things is in their vessels</em>; which say, Stand by thyself, come not near to me; for I am holier than thou. These are a smoke in my nose, a fire that burneth all the day. <cite><b>Isaiah 65:1-5</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              For, behold, the LORD will come with fire, and with his chariots like a whirlwind, to render his anger with fury, and his rebuke with flames of fire. For by fire and by his sword will the LORD plead with all flesh: and the slain of the LORD shall be many. They that sanctify themselves, and purify themselves in the gardens behind one tree in the midst, <em>eating swine's flesh, and the abomination, and the mouse, shall be consumed together</em>, saith the LORD. <cite><b>Isaiah 66:15-17</b></cite>

            <p>
              Say unto them, As I live, saith the Lord GOD, <em>I have no pleasure in the death of the wicked</em>; but that the wicked turn from his way and live: <em>turn ye, turn ye from your evil ways; for why will ye die, O house of Israel</em>? <cite><b>Ezekiel 33:11</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">

Let us therefore <em>come boldly unto the throne of grace, that we may obtain mercy, and find grace</em> to help in time of need. <cite><b>Hebrews 4:15, 16</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> Jesus knows my struggles because He experienced them Himself, and so He bids me to come to His throne that I may receive mercy and grace to meet them with boldness and overcome.

            <h2>What is God’s will regarding sin?</h2>
            <p>
              But <em>your iniquities have separated between you and your God</em>, and your sins have hid his face from you, that he will not hear. <cite><b>Isaiah 59:2</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              And she shall bring forth a son, and thou shalt call his name JESUS: for <em>he shall save his people from their sins</em>. <cite><b>Matthew 1:21</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just <em>to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness</em>. <cite><b>1 John 1:9</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              Who his own self bare our sins in his own body on the tree, that we, <em>being dead to sins, should live unto righteousness</em>: by whose stripes ye were healed. <cite><b>1 Peter 2:24</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> Before sin entered the world, Adam and Eve communicated with God face to face. Once they allowed sin to enter their hearts, it separated them from their Creator because sin cannot exist in the presence of a holy God&mdash;His presence is a consuming fire to those who cherish sin (<a>Deuteronomy 4:24</a>). The Father then sent His Son not only to pay the penalty for sin on our behalf, but also to save us from our sins. He wants to forgive and cleanse us from any and all unrighteousness so that we may be dead to sin and alive to righteousness!

            <h2>What is the first step to victory over sin?</h2>
            <p>
               And if it seem evil unto you to serve the LORD, <em>choose you this day whom ye will serve</em>; whether the gods which your fathers served that were on the other side of the flood, or the gods of the Amorites, in whose land ye dwell: but as for me and my house, we will serve the LORD. <cite><b>Joshua 24:15</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> Sin is a choice, an act of the will because the devil cannot force anyone to sin. I get to choose whom I will serve every single day. Now it’s true that will power without God is my own power, but an act of the will is the first step on the road to victory. Sin can be defeated only if I cooperate with God; He will do for me what I cannot do for myself, but I need to do my part by making a firm choice to serve Him. Jesus raised Lazarus from the dead, but He didn’t roll away the stone because people were capable of doing that themselves. There is also a huge difference between desiring to overcome and choosing to overcome. God is powerless to help me until I make that choice, so whenever temptation comes, my first response can be “No, I choose to serve Christ.”

            <h2>What is the second step?</h2>
            <p>
               But <em>thanks be to God, which giveth us the victory</em> through our Lord Jesus Christ. <cite><b>1 Corinthians 15:57</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
               And Jesus answering saith unto them, <em>Have faith in God</em>. For verily I say unto you, That whosoever shall say unto this mountain, Be thou removed, and be thou cast into the sea; and shall not doubt in his heart, but shall believe that those things which he saith shall come to pass; he shall have whatsoever he saith. Therefore I say unto you, What things soever ye desire, when ye pray, <em>believe that ye receive them</em>, and ye shall have them. <cite><b>Mark 11:22-24</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
               And this is the confidence that we have in him, that, <em>if we ask any thing according to his will, he heareth us</em>. And if we know that he hear us, whatsoever we ask, we know that we have the petitions that we desired of him.  <cite><b>1 John 5:14, 15</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> The Bible is clear that it’s God will for me to have victory over sin. The Bible also says anything that I ask in faith according to His will He will do, and Paul even encourages me to thank God for the victory He gives me through Jesus. Just like the Israelites gave a loud shout of victory before the walls of Jericho came down (<a>Joshua 6:16</a>), I can claim that victory by faith and thank God for it. Faith in the power of God is crucial; it is the difference between merely asking for victory and believing it. The victory is a gift that needs to be received and accepted. So after saying “No, I choose to serve Christ,” my second response to temptation can be “Thank you God for the victory that is mine through Jesus.”

            <h2>What is the third step?</h2>
            <p>
               Likewise <em>reckon ye also yourselves to be dead indeed unto sin</em>, but alive unto God through Jesus Christ our Lord. Let not sin therefore reign in your mortal body, that ye should obey it in the lusts thereof. Neither yield ye your members as instruments of unrighteousness unto sin: but yield yourselves unto God, as those that are alive from the dead, and your members as instruments of righteousness unto God. For sin shall not have dominion over you. <cite><b>Romans 6:11-14</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> Through the righteousness of Jesus and the power of the Holy Spirit in me I can be dead to sin. Temptation has no power over a corpse, and I can be just as dead to it. After thanking God for the victory, I can follow it up with “I am dead to this sin.” And remember, dying to sin is not divorcing a best friend, but an evil enemy. It is a cause for joy and celebration! So do not crawl, but run from it like Joseph did (<a>Genesis 39:12</a>).

            <h2>Is it smart to dwell on the temptation?</h2>
            <p>
              Blessed is the man that endureth temptation: for when he is tried, he shall receive the crown of life, which the Lord hath promised to them that love him. Let no man say when he is tempted, I am tempted of God: for God cannot be tempted with evil, neither tempteth he any man: but every man is tempted, when he is drawn away of his own lust, and enticed. Then <em>when lust hath conceived, it bringeth forth sin</em>: and sin, when it is finished, bringeth forth death. <cite><b>James 1:12-15</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              Wherefore <em>gird up the loins of your mind</em>, be sober, and hope to the end for the grace that is to be brought unto you at the revelation of Jesus Christ. <cite><b>1 Peter 1:13</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              Casting down imaginations, and every high thing that exalteth itself against the knowledge of God, and <em>bringing into captivity every thought to the obedience of Christ</em>. <cite><b>2 Corinthians 10:5</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              For <em>as he thinks</em> in his heart, <em>so is he</em>. <cite><b>Proverns 23:7</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> Sin occurs when the door of the mind is opened, and it’s then let inside and entertained. Temptation becomes sin when it’s cherished in the mind and, in the words of James, allowed to conceive sin. Peter calls us to bind the mind, like a soldier binds his belt in preparation for action, so the mind is ready to deal with temptation. Paul tells us to bring every thought into captivity to Christ since a sinful thought immediately rejected does not have strength. The faster I turn to God the safer I am, and the more I do it the easier it gets.

            <h2>How did Jesus meet temptation?</h2>
            <p>
              And when the tempter came to him, he said, If thou be the Son of God, command that these stones be made bread. But he answered and said, <em>It is written</em>, Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God. <cite><b>Matthew 4:3, 4</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              For <em>the word of God is living and powerful, and sharper than any two-edged sword</em>, piercing even to the division of soul and spirit, and of joints and marrow, and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart. <cite><b>Hebrews 4:12, NKJV</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              <em>Your word I have hidden in my heart</em>, that I might not sin against You. <cite><b>Psalm 119:11</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              But we all, with open face <em>beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord, are changed into the same image</em> from glory to glory, even as by the Spirit of the Lord. <cite><b>2 Corinthians 3:18</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> Jesus met temptation by quoting Scripture. Hebrews tells us the Bible is alive, powerful, and sharper than any sword. When I store His word in my mind by reading it daily and memorizing favorite passages, I am “girding” up my mind. Furthermore, I become what I behold, so by beholding the character of Christ as revealed in His word, my character will be transformed to reflect His character through the work of the Holy Spirit. The next time temptation comes, let’s follow the example of our Redeemer and turn to the Bible to give us victory!

            <h2>How can I reduce temptation?</h2>
            <p>
              But <em>put ye on the Lord Jesus Christ</em>, and <em>make not provision for the flesh</em>, to fulfil the lusts thereof. <cite><b>Romans 13:14</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              This I say then, <em>Walk in the Spirit</em>, and ye shall not fulfil the lust of the flesh. <cite><b>Galatians 5:16</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              <em>Commit thy works unto the LORD</em>, and thy thoughts shall be established. <cite><b>Proverbs 16:3</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              And if thy right hand offend thee, <em>cut it off</em>, and cast it from thee: for it is profitable for thee that one of thy members should perish, and not that thy whole body should be cast into hell. <cite><b>Matthew 5:30</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> The Bible invites me to “put on Christ” and “walk in the Spirit.” I do this by beginning every day sitting at His feet, like Mary did (<a>Luke 10:39</a>), reading His Word and asking Him to convert my heart and mind. Then I commit my will to Him for that day. And then I “make no provision for the flesh” by removing myself from temptation and doing all that I can to create an environment that is free from it. When I leave room for temptation I am telling myself I will fail, so throw it out, pour it out, delete the app, cancel the subscription, cut the cable.

            <h2>What is God’s promise?</h2>
            <p>
               There hath no temptation taken you but such as is common to man: but <em>God is faithful</em>, who will not suffer you to be tempted above that ye are able; but <em>will with the temptation also make a way to escape, that ye may be able to bear it</em>. <cite><b>1 Corinthians 10:13</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> We saw in <a>James 1:12</a> that God does not tempt anyone, but now we have a promise that He will not allow us to be tested beyond what we are able to bear! He provides a way of escape for every temptation the devil throws at us!

            <h2>What if I’ve struggled with the same sin for years?</h2>
            <p>
              For the weapons of our warfare are not carnal, but <em>mighty through God to the pulling down of strong holds</em>. <cite><b>2 Corinthians 10:4</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              <em>I can do all things through Christ</em> which strengtheneth me. <cite><b>Philippians 4:13</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              For a righteous person falls seven times and <em>rises again</em>, but the wicked stumble in time of disaster. <cite><b>Proverbs 24:16</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              And <em>he arose, and came to his father. But when he was yet a great way off, his father saw him, and had compassion, and ran, and fell on his neck, and kissed him</em>. And the son said unto him, Father, I have sinned against heaven, and in thy sight, and am no more worthy to be called thy son. But the father said to his servants, Bring forth the best robe, and put it on him; and put a ring on his hand, and shoes on his feet: and bring hither the fatted calf, and kill it; and let us eat, and be merry: for this my son was dead, and is alive again; he was lost, and is found. And they began to be merry. <cite><b>Luke 15:20-24</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> The walls of Jericho seemed insurmountable, and they were, as far as human strength was concerned (<a>Numbers 13:28</a>), but then the God of the universe got involved, and they crumbled like sand. The walls of sin in our lives are the same until we ask God to get involved and intervene on our behalf, and the promise is that Jesus Christ is mighty to pull them down! It’s not about how many times I’ve fallen, but whether I got up and went to the Father who is waiting for me with outstretched arms. I can never think of yourself as a hopeless case; it’s not from God. My past history is not my legacy or destiny. It’s not “I'd like to be an overcomer,” or “I hope to be.” Through the grace and power of Christ in my life I am an overcomer!

            <h2>What is the most powerful motivation for overcoming sin?</h2>
            <p>
              For the <em>preaching of the cross</em> is to them that perish foolishness; but <em>unto us which are saved it is the power of God</em>. <cite><b>1 Corinthians 1:18</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
               That Christ may dwell in your hearts by faith; that ye, <em>being rooted and grounded in love</em>, may be able to comprehend with all saints what is the breadth, and length, and depth, and height; and <em>to know the love of Christ</em>, which passeth knowledge, that ye might be filled with all the fulness of God. <cite><b>Ephesians 3:17-19</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
               <em>We love him</em>, because he first loved us. <cite><b>1 John 4:19</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> The more time I spend thinking about what Jesus did for me on the cross, the more my love for Him will grow and my abhorence for sin will increase. Sin is so evil that it required the Son of God to leave the courts of heaven, take on human nature, live a perfect life while assailed by the devil on every side, and die the death of the worse criminal on the cross because the Creator God was the only One who could pay the penalty for my sins. Let’s get grounded in the love of Christ as revealed on the cross, so it becomes the driving motivation for victory over sin. The more I love Him the more I’ll hate those things that separate me from Him and are repulsive to His character.

            <h2>What does Revelation say about those who overcome?</h2>
            <p>
              And <em>they overcame him by the blood of the Lamb</em>, and by the word of their testimony; and they loved not their lives unto the death. <cite><b>Revelation 12:11</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              <em>To him that overcometh will I grant to sit with me on my throne</em>, even as I also overcame, and am set down with my Father on his throne. <cite><b>Revelation 3:21</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              The four and twenty elders fall down before him that sat on the throne, and worship him that liveth for ever and ever, and <em>cast their crowns before the throne, saying, Thou art worthy, O Lord, to receive glory and honour and power</em>: for thou hast created all things, and for thy pleasure they are and were created. <cite><b>Revelation 4:10, 11</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> There is power in what Jesus did on the cross because Revelation says the saints overcame Satan by the blood of Jesus Christ. He gives them the victory, and then He grants them to sit on His throne! This is an echo of how the Father treated His prodigal son. Such treatment is completely undeserved, but He does it anyway out of His immeasurable love for His children. No wonder the saints in heaven will cast their crowns before His throne in worship and adoration saying that He is worthy to receive glory, honor, and power.

            <h2>What is the spirit that returns to God?</h2>
            <p>
              All the while <em>my breath is in me</em>, and <em>the spirit of God is in my nostrils</em>. <cite><b>Job 27:3</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              For as <em>the body without the spirit is dead</em>, so faith without works is dead also. <cite><b>James 2:26</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> The spirit that returns to God is simply the breath of life, without which the body dies. In other words, the process described in <a>Ecclesiastes 12:7</a> is the opposite of what happened in <a>Genesis 2:7</a>. If a soul is a combination of two things&mdash;the body and the breath of life (spirit)&mdash;then the soul ceases to exist when the body returns to dust and the breath returns to God. The soul does not go anywhere; it simply ceases to exist. As an illustration, consider what is needed for light: there needs to be an electrical current and a bulb. As soon as the electrical current is turned off, the light simply ceases to exist. It is the same with the soul.

            <h2>What else does the Bible about the soul?</h2>
            <p>
              Behold, all souls are mine; as the soul of the father, so also the soul of the son is mine: the <em>soul that sinneth, it shall die</em>. <cite><b>Ezekiel 18:4</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              For <em>the wages of sin is death</em>; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord. <cite><b>Romans 6:23</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              For <em>all have sinned</em>, and come short of the glory of God. <cite><b>Romans 3:23</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> A person’s soul or spirit cannot go to heaven or hell after death because the Bible is clear that the soul that sins shall die. Why is this the case? Because the wages of sin are death, and all have sinned.

            <p>
              Put not your trust in princes, nor in the son of man, in whom there is no help. <em>His breath goeth forth, he returneth to his earth; in that very day his thoughts perish</em>. <cite><b>Psalm 146:3, 4</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> Since the spirit is simply the breath then it is not possible for the spirit to exist after death. Here the psalmist describes the same process of death that was described in the previous verses: the breath leaving the body and returning to God who gave it, the body returning to dust (the earth), and when these two things happen all conscious thought ceases to exist.

              That thou keep this commandment without spot, unrebukeable, until the appearing of our Lord Jesus Christ: which in his times he shall shew, who is the blessed and only Potentate, the King of kings, and Lord of lords; <em>who only hath immortality</em>, dwelling in the light which no man can approach unto; whom no man hath seen, nor can see: to whom be honour and power everlasting. <cite><b>1 Timothy 6:14-16</b></cite>

            <p>
              For the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the archangel, and with the trump of God: and the dead in Christ shall rise first: then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air: and <em>so shall we ever be with the Lord</em>. <cite><b>1 Thessalonians 4:16, 17</b></cite>

              Behold, I shew you a mystery; we shall not all sleep, but <em>we shall all be changed</em>, in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trump: for the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed. <em>For this corruptible must put on incorruption, and this mortal must put on immortality</em>. So when this corruptible shall have put on incorruption, and this mortal shall have put on immortality, then shall be brought to pass the saying that is written, <em>Death is swallowed up in victory</em>. <cite><b>1 Corinthians 15:51-54</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> 1 Corinthians 15 says that not all the righteous will experience death, but all the righteous will be changed when the trumpet of God sounds at the second coming. In other words, the righteous who are live to see the second coming, as well as those who died in Christ, who will at that moment be resurrected, will receive new, immortal bodies. From that point on death will never have power over them because Jesus defeated it, and by accepting His sacrifice on their behalf, they will inherit His victory over it!

            <p>
              And Jesus said unto him, Verily I say unto thee, <em>today shalt thou be with me in paradise</em>. <cite><b>Luke 23:43</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              Jesus saith unto her, Touch me not; for <em>I am not yet ascended to my Father</em>: but go to my brethren, and say unto them, I ascend unto my Father, and your Father; and to my God, and your God. <cite><b>John 20:17</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> Jesus could not have gone to heaven after His death because on Sunday morning He told Mary He hadn’t yet ascended to His Father. It’s a little know fact, but the original Bible text did not have any punctuation. It was added centuries later by translators who could have placed the comma before the word “today” due to their own beliefs about death. The better place for the comma would be after the word “today” because then it would be in harmony with all the other Bible texts regarding death. Jesus was promising the thief on the cross that day&mdash;when it did not look like He could save anyone&mdash;that he would be with Him in Paradise one day when He returns to take all of His children home to heaven.

And Saul perceived that it was Samuel, and he stooped with his face to the ground, and bowed himself. <cite><b>1 Samuel 28:13, 14</b></cite>

            <p>
              And there came forth a spirit, and stood before the LORD, and said, I will persuade him. And the LORD said unto him, Wherewith? And he said, <em>I will go forth, and I will be a lying spirit in the mouth of all his prophets</em>. And he said, Thou shalt persuade him, and prevail also: go forth, and do so. <cite><b>1 Kings 22:21, 22</b></cite>

              <em>For they are the spirits of devils, working miracles</em>, which go forth unto the kings of the earth and of the whole world, to gather them to the battle of that great day of God Almighty. <cite><b>Revelation 16:14</b></cite>

            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> It could not have been Samuel that Saul saw because the Bible is clear that the dead remain dead until the resurrection. In Revelation we learn that the devil has fallen angels whom he was able to persuade to join his rebellion in heaven, and after he was cast to earth, they were cast down with him (<a>Revelation 12:4</a>). In other places, they are called “lying spirits” and “spirits of devils” who have the power to work miracles, including masquerading as human beings. In fact, Satan Himself is able to appear as an angel of light (<a>2 Corinthians 11:14</a>). Saul saw one of these spirits masquerading as Samuel.

            <p>
              <em>Do not turn to mediums or spiritists; do not seek them out to be defiled by them</em>. I am the LORD your God. <cite><b>Leviticus 19:31, NASB</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              There shall not be found among you any one that maketh his son or his daughter to pass through the fire, <em>or that useth divination, or an observer of times, or an enchanter, or a witch, or a charmer, or a consulter with familiar spirits, or a wizard, or a necromancer. For all that do these things are an abomination unto the LORD</em>: and because of these abominations the LORD thy God doth drive them out from before thee. <cite><b>Deuteronomy 18:10-12</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              Now the Spirit speaketh expressly, that in the latter times some shall depart from the faith, <em>giving heed to seducing spirits, and doctrines of devils</em>. <cite><b>1 Timothy 4:1</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              And when they say to you, “Seek those who are mediums and wizards, who whisper and mutter,” should not a people seek their God? Should they seek the dead on behalf of the living? <em>To the law and to the testimony! If they do not speak according to this word, it is because there is no light in them</em>. <cite><b>Isaiah 8:19, 20, NKJV</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> Communication with spirits is forbidden in the Bible because it’s an abomination to God. Paul also warns that this practice is one of the signs of the last days, and it will lead to deception and a departure from the faith, meaning it will be practiced by those who claim to be believers. Isaiah says that the only way to identify whether a spirit is from God or not is to compare what it says with the Word of God because every lying spirit will speak contrary to His Word.

And the beast was taken, and with him the false prophet that wrought miracles before him, with which he deceived them that had received the mark of the beast, and them that worshipped his image. These both were cast alive <em>into a lake of fire</em> burning with brimstone. And <em>the remnant were slain with the sword of him that sat upon the horse, which sword proceeded out of his mouth: and all the fowls were filled with their flesh</em>. <cite><b>Revelation 19:11-21</b></cite>

              <b>Note:</b> Because sin cannot exist in the presence of a holy God, to everyone who didn’t accept Jesus’ sacrifice on their behalf so He could cover their sins the second coming will be like a consuming fire because they will have to pay for their sins themselves. Revelation 19 uses symbolic imagery to describe how they will be destroyed by the brightness of His holy presence.

            <p>
              And I saw an angel come down from heaven, having the key of the bottomless pit and a great chain in his hand. And <em>he laid hold on the dragon, that old serpent, which is the Devil, and Satan, and bound him a thousand years</em>. <cite><b>Revelation 20:1, 2</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> The chain described here is a symbolic chain of circumstances because Satan will be confined to planet earth without anyone to tempt or deceive since the saved are in heaven and the unsaved are dead, and for the first time since his rebellion in heaven, he is deprived of his power. This will be his fate for 1,000 years. It is interesting to note that the Greek word for “bottomless pit” is “abussos,” or abyss, and it is the same word used in <a>Genesis 1:2</a> for the word “deep,” meaning the earth will resemble its original state during this time.

              And I John <em>saw the holy city, new Jerusalem, coming down from God out of heaven</em>, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband. <cite><b>Revelation 21:2</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              And his feet shall stand in that day upon the mount of Olives, which is before Jerusalem on the east, and <em>the mount of Olives shall cleave in the midst thereof toward the east and toward the west, and there shall be a very great valley</em>; and half of the mountain shall remove toward the north, and half of it toward the south. ... and the <em>LORD my God shall come, and all the saints with thee</em>. ... And the <em>LORD shall be king over all the earth</em>: in that day shall there be one LORD, and his name one. <cite><b>Zechariah 14:4, 5, 9</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              But the <em>rest of the dead lived not again until the thousand years were finished</em>. This is the first resurrection. <cite><b>Revelation 20:5</b></cite>

            <p>
              Marvel not at this: for the hour is coming, in the which all that are in the graves shall hear his voice, and shall come forth; <em>they that have done good, unto the resurrection of life</em>; and <em>they that have done evil, unto the resurrection of damnation</em>. <cite><b>John 5:28, 29</b></cite>

              And <em>shall go out to deceive the nations</em> which are in the four quarters of the earth, Gog and Magog, to gather them together to battle: the number of whom is as the sand of the sea. And they went up on the breadth of the earth, and <em>compassed the camp of the saints about, and the beloved city</em>. <cite><b>Revelation 20:8, 9</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              And <em>I saw a great white throne, and him that sat on it</em>, from whose face the earth and the heaven fled away; and there was found no place for them. And <em>I saw the dead, small and great, stand before God; and the books were opened</em>: and another book was opened, which is the book of life: and the <em>dead were judged out of those things which were written in the books, according to their works</em>. <cite><b>Revelation 20:11, 12</b></cite>

              <b>Note:</b> Satan manages to deceive the wicked, who realize they are shut out of the New Jerusalem, and persuades them to surround the city and attempt to capture it. But God’s throne will suddenly appear, bringing the attack to a halt and beginning the final phase of the judgment. The wicked will see their life pass before them and realize that God did everything He could to save them from their life of sin, but they did not heed Him, and without the sacrifice of Jesus covering their sins, they are left to pay for their own sins.

This is the second death from which there is no resurrection, marking the end of the controversy between God and Satan, good and evil. For the God of love (<a>1 John 4:8</a>), this will be a difficult thing to watch because every single person who is destroyed is one whom He loved and for whom Jesus died. He did everything He could to save them, but they persistently rejected Him, and so He has no other option left. Once there is nothing but ashes left (<a>Malachi 4:3</a>), the fire will go out, and the universe will finally be free from sin.

              <b>Note:</b> If God could save every single person, without infringing on their freedom to choose, He would, but this He does not do, because He respects every person’s free will. Instead, He knocks patiently at the door of every heart (<a>Revelation 3:20</a>), waiting to be let in.

            <p>
              Say unto them, As I live, saith the Lord GOD, <em>I have no pleasure in the death of the wicked</em>; but that the wicked turn from his way and live: <em>turn ye, turn ye from your evil ways; for why will ye die, O house of Israel</em>? <cite><b>Ezekiel 33:11</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              For the LORD shall rise up as in mount Perazim, he shall be wroth as in the valley of Gibeon, that he may do his work, <em>his strange work</em>; and bring to pass his act, <em>his strange act</em>. <cite><b>Isaiah 28:21</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              For, behold, <em>the day cometh, that shall burn as an oven; and all the proud, yea, and all that do wickedly, shall be stubble: and the day that cometh shall burn them up</em>, saith the LORD of hosts, that it shall leave them neither root nor branch. But unto you that fear my name shall the Sun of righteousness arise with healing in his wings; and ye shall go forth, and grow up as calves of the stall. And ye shall tread down the wicked; for they <em>shall be ashes</em> under the soles of your feet in the day that I shall do this, saith the LORD of hosts. <cite><b>Malachi 4:1-3</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> Because the wicked choose to cling to sin, which, at its core, is selfishness and in complete opposition to the government of love, God has no other choice but to destroy them. The Bible calls this a strange act because God has no pleasure in the death of the wicked; these are people for whom He died, but because they refuse to turn from their path of sin and destruction, He must respect their choice and leave them to its consequences so that the curse of sin&mdash;the misery, suffering, and ruin&mdash;can be finally blotted out. Note also that Malachi says the fire will burn them up and turn them into ashes, meaning they will not burn in hell forever.

            <h2>Is there another instance of this in the Bible?</h2>
            <p>
              Thus saith the LORD; Take heed to yourselves, and bear no burden on the sabbath day, nor bring it in by the gates of Jerusalem; neither carry forth a burden out of your houses on the sabbath day, neither do ye any work, but hallow ye the sabbath day, as I commanded your fathers. But they obeyed not, neither inclined their ear, but made their neck stiff, that they might not hear, nor receive instruction.
              <br><br>
              And it shall come to pass, if ye diligently hearken unto me, saith the LORD, to bring in no burden through the gates of this city on the sabbath day, but hallow the sabbath day, to do no work therein; then shall there enter into the gates of this city kings and princes sitting upon the throne of David, riding in chariots and on horses, they, and their princes, the men of Judah, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem: and this city shall remain for ever. And they shall come from the cities of Judah, and from the places about Jerusalem, and from the land of Benjamin, and from the plain, and from the mountains, and from the south, bringing burnt offerings, and sacrifices, and meat offerings, and incense, and bringing sacrifices of praise, unto the house of the LORD.
              <br><br>
              But if ye will not hearken unto me to hallow the sabbath day, and not to bear a burden, even entering in at the gates of Jerusalem on the sabbath day; <em>then will I kindle a fire in the gates thereof, and it shall devour the palaces of Jerusalem, and it shall not be quenched</em>. <cite><b>Jeremiah 17:19-27</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              Then <em>they burned the house of God, broke down the wall of Jerusalem, burned all its palaces with fire, and destroyed all its precious possessions</em>. And those who escaped from the sword he carried away to Babylon, where they became servants to him and his sons until the rule of the kingdom of Persia, to fulfill the word of the Lord by the mouth of Jeremiah, until the land had enjoyed her Sabbaths. As long as she lay desolate she kept Sabbath, to fulfill seventy years. <cite><b>2 Chronicles 36:21-27</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> 2 Chronicles 36 was the fulfillment of the prophecy given by Jeremiah in chapter 17. Obviously, the fire is no longer burning, but when it was burning, it was an unquenchable fire that could not be put out until it consumed everything.

              Then his master shall bring him unto the judges; he shall also bring him to the door, or unto the door post; and his master shall bore his ear through with an aul; and <em>he shall serve him for ever</em>. <cite><b>Exodus 21:6</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              But Hannah went not up; for she said unto her husband, I will not go up until the child be weaned, and then I will bring him, that he may appear before the LORD, and <em>there abide for ever</em>. ...

            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> The Greek word for “for ever” in <a>Revelation 20:10</a> is “aion.” It’s where the word “eon” comes from. In the Bible it’s often used to indicate an unspecified period of time. In <a>Exodus 21:6</a> it represents the life of a slave, and in <a>1 Samuel 1:22, 28</a> it means as long as Samuel lives; likewise, in <a>Revelation 20:10</a> it means the torment lasts until death brings it to an end.

            <p>
              As therefore the tares are gathered and burned in the fire; so <em>shall it be in the end of this world</em>. The Son of man shall send forth his angels, and they shall gather out of his kingdom all things that offend, and them which do iniquity; and <em>shall cast them into a furnace of fire</em>: there shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth. <cite><b>Matthew 13:40-42</b></cite>

            <p>
              But the day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night; in the which the heavens shall pass away with a great noise, and the elements shall melt with fervent heat, <em>the earth also and the works that are therein shall be burned up</em>. <cite><b>2 Peter 3:10</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              And they went up on the breadth of the earth, and compassed the camp of the saints about, and the beloved city: and <em>fire came down from God out of heaven, and devoured them</em>. <cite><b>Revelation 20:9</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> The Bible says the fire comes down on earth at the end of the 1,000 year period when the wicked are raised from the dead and Satan deceives them, for the last time, to make an attempt to capture the New Jerusalem (see “1,000 Years of Peace”). This is referred to as “the end of the world” in other Bible passages because it is God’s final act of cleansing the world of sin. This also means there is no one burning in hell now. The Bible makes it clear that the dead are in their graves waiting for the resurrection: the saved are waiting for the first resurrection at the second coming of Christ (see “Are the Dead Really Dead?”), while the lost are waiting for the second resurrection at the end of the 1,000 years (see “1,000 Years of Peace).

            </p>
            <p>
              Thine heart was lifted up because of thy beauty, thou hast corrupted thy wisdom by reason of thy brightness: I will cast thee to the ground, I will lay thee before kings, that they may behold thee. Thou hast defiled thy sanctuaries by the multitude of thine iniquities, by the iniquity of thy traffick; therefore <em>will I bring forth a fire from the midst of thee, it shall devour thee, and I will bring thee to ashes</em> upon the earth in the sight of all them that behold thee. <cite><b>Ezekiel 28:17, 18</b></cite>

              <b>Note:</b> The fire cleanses the earth from all traces of sin, and so the fallen angels, including Satan, will also be destroyed by it, turning them to ashes, because the entire rebellion against God started with Satan and the angels he managed to deceive (see “Origin of Evil”).

            <p>

            </p>
            <p>
              Behold, they shall be as stubble; <em>the fire shall burn them</em>; they shall not deliver themselves from the power of the flame: <em>there shall not be a coal to warm at, nor fire to sit before it</em>. <cite><b>Isaiah 47:14</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              For the day of the LORD is near upon all the heathen: as thou hast done, it shall be done unto thee: thy reward shall return upon thine own head. For as ye have drunk upon my holy mountain, so shall all the heathen drink continually, yea, they shall drink, and they shall swallow down, and <em>they shall be as though they had not been</em>. <cite><b>Obadiah 15, 16</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> Hell cannot burn forever because the wages of sin are death, not eternal torment for a short life of sin. How cruel would that be! This eternal hell teaching goes all the way back to the Garden of Eden where Satan told Eve she would surely not die (<a>Genesis 3:4</a>) even though God clearly said that sin brings death (<a>Genesis 2:17</a>). But make no mistake, Jesus would rather die on the cross Himself than watch His creation destroyed by fire; nevertheless, He also respects every person’s freedom of choice, and in an effort to purge the world from the misery of sin, it is, ultimately, an act of love to bring the rebellion to an end. And so the fire will burn out once it finishes its work, and there will be not a coal left to warm at. Satan, his angels, and the wicked will cease to exist, never to live again.

              Jesus answered and said unto him, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, <em>Except a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God</em>. Nicodemus saith unto him, How can a man be born when he is old? can he enter the second time into his mother's womb, and be born?

              <b>Note:</b> No one is born pure in heart, hungering and thirsting after rigtheousness because all have sinned (<a>Romans 3:23</a>). This is why Jesus said that no one can see the kingdom of God without being born again of the Spirit. So even though all have sinned, some, after learning about the love of Jesus, choose to put an end to the rebellion against Him in their lives. They make peace with Him by reaching out and taking His hand of mercy that offers forgiveness and imparts grace into their lives, restoring them into His image and fitting them for heaven. They surrender their hearts to Him and become the blessed ones of Matthew 5 who have been transformed by His love and made citizens of His kingdom (<a>Philippians 3:20</a>).

They will be able to commune with Him the way Adam and Eve did before sin entered the world: face-to-face! These passages also tell us that God did not create earth just to watch it be destroyed by sin. No, He will abolish sin, recreate earth, and make it even more glorious than it was in Eden! He will do the work which Adam, Eve, and their offspring would have done had they never sinned&mdash;to populate and build up the earth (<a>Genesis 1:28</a>).

            <h2>What will the saved be doing there?</h2>
            <p>
              And <em>they shall build houses, and inhabit them; and they shall plant vineyards, and eat the fruit of them</em>. They shall not build, and another inhabit; they shall not plant, and another eat: for as the days of a tree are the days of my people, and mine elect shall <em>long enjoy the work of their hands</em>. <em>They shall not labour in vain, nor bring forth for trouble</em>; for they are the seed of the blessed of the LORD, and their offspring with them. <cite><b>Isaiah 65:21-23</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              And I say unto you, That many shall come from the east and west, and <em>shall sit down with Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob</em>, in the kingdom of heaven. <cite><b>Matthew 8:11</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> In addition to having a mansion in the New Jerusalem built by Jesus (<a>John 14:1-3</a>), the saved will also build their own homes and plant their own vineyards. Real people will be doing real things, and they will be enjoying the fruit of their labor, unlike on earth where hard work can end in disappointment, theft, or sudden destruction. The saved will also have the blessing of friendship and fellowship with one another, including the heroes of the Bible!

            <h2>Will there be predation and killing?</h2>
            <p>
              The <em>wolf and the lamb shall feed together</em>, and the lion shall eat straw like the bullock: and dust shall be the serpent's meat. <em>They shall not hurt nor destroy</em> in all my holy mountain, saith the LORD. <cite><b>Isaiah 65:25</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              The wolf will live with the lamb, and the leopard will lie down with the goat; the calf and young lion and fatling will be together, and a little child will lead them. The cow will graze with the bear, their young will lie down together, and the lion will eat straw like the ox. The infant will play by the cobra’s den, and the toddler will reach into the viper’s nest. <em>They will neither harm nor destroy</em> on all My holy mountain, for the earth will be full of the knowledge of the LORD as the sea is full of water. <cite><b>Isaiah 11:6-9</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> There will be no death in heaven, which means no predatory behavior either.

            <h2>What else will be different there?</h2>
            <p>
              And I saw a new heaven and a new earth: for the first heaven and the first earth were passed away; and <em>there was no more sea</em>. <cite><b>Revelation 21:1</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              The wilderness and the solitary place shall be glad for them; and the <em>desert shall rejoice, and blossom as the rose</em>. <cite><b>Isaiah 35:1</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              And <em>there shall be no night there</em>; and they need no candle, neither light of the sun; <em>for the Lord God giveth them light</em>: and they shall reign for ever and ever. <cite><b>Revelation 22:5</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              But they that wait upon the LORD shall renew their strength; they shall <em>mount up with wings as eagles</em>; they shall <em>run, and not be weary; and they shall walk, and not faint</em>. <cite><b>Isaiah 40:31</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              And there shall <em>in no wise enter into it any thing that defileth, neither whatsoever worketh abomination, or maketh a lie</em>: but they which are written in the Lamb's book of life. <cite><b>Revelation 21:27</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              <em>Violence shall no more be heard in thy land, wasting nor destruction within thy borders</em>; but thou shalt call thy walls Salvation, and thy gates Praise. The sun shall be no more thy light by day; neither for brightness shall the moon give light unto thee: but <em>the LORD shall be unto thee an everlasting light</em>, and thy God thy glory. Thy sun shall no more go down; neither shall thy moon withdraw itself: for the LORD shall be thine everlasting light, and the days of thy mourning shall be ended. <em>Thy people also shall be all righteous</em>: they shall inherit the land for ever, the branch of my planting, the work of my hands, that I may be glorified. <cite><b>Isaiah 60:18-21</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> Vast oceans and deserts make up a large portion of the earth’s surface today, but that will no longer be the case in heaven. There will also be no night there because the brightness of God’s presence will permeate the whole earth. There will be no weariness after hard work, and the saved will be able to fly like the angels, maybe even visiting other unfallen worlds created by God (<a>Job 1:6; Hebrews 1:2; 11:3</a>)! No destruction means there will be no natural disasters. And because heaven is a place where righteousness dwells, there will be nothing there that defiles, meaning no deception, no crime, no drunkenness, no brothels, no abuse, nor any other impurity. The righteous will be clothed with the righteousness of Jesus and will reflect His character of love!

            <h2>What will the New Jerusalem be like?</h2>
            <p>
              And the city lieth <em>foursquare</em>, and the length is as large as the breadth: and he measured the city with the reed, twelve thousand furlongs. The <em>length and the breadth and the height of it are equal</em>. And <em>he measured the wall thereof, an hundred and forty and four cubits</em>, according to the measure of a man, that is, of the angel. <cite><b>Revelation 21:16, 17</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              And the building of the <em>wall of it was of jasper</eM>: and the <em>city was pure gold</em>, like unto clear glass. And the <em>foundations of the wall of the city were garnished with all manner of precious stones</em>. The first foundation was jasper; the second, sapphire; the third, a chalcedony; the fourth, an emerald; the fifth, sardonyx; the sixth, sardius; the seventh, chrysolite; the eighth, beryl; the ninth, a topaz; the tenth, a chrysoprasus; the eleventh, a jacinth; the twelfth, an amethyst. And the twelve gates were twelve pearls; <em>every several gate was of one pearl</em>: and the <em>street of the city was pure gold</em>, as it were transparent glass. <cite><b>Revelation 21:18-21</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> The city is arranged in a square with its width, length, and height equal. The distance around it is 12,000 furlongs or 1,500 miles (1 furlong is 1/8 of a mile), which means it’s 375 miles long each side! The streets are of pure gold, and the walls are 144 cubits or 216 feet of solid jasper&mdash;nearly 20 stories high&mdash;with 12 gates total, and each gate is of a single pearl. The city also has 12 foundations with each one of a different precious stone and color, so from a distance it will look like it’s resting upon a rainbow! When the New Jerusalem descends from heaven at the end of the 1,000 years (see “1,000 Years of Peace”), it will rest on a great plain created for it by Jesus after He flattens the Mount of Olives (<a>Zechariah 14:4, 5</a>).

            <h2>What about the food and water supply?</h2>
            <p>
              And he shewed me <em>a pure river of water of life</em>, clear as crystal, proceeding out of the throne of God and of the Lamb. In the midst of the street of it, and on either side of the river, was there <em>the tree of life, which bare twelve manner of fruits, and yielded her fruit every month</em>: and the leaves of the tree were for the healing of the nations. <cite><b>Revelation 22:1, 2</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> The city is watered by the river of life that flows from the throne of God, while the tree of life produces a different kind of fruit each month! In addition to this, the saved will also plant their own food at the homes they build (<a>Isaiah 65:21</a>). Since there will be no death there, the diet will be what it was before Adam and Eve sinned: fruits, grains, and nuts (<a>Gensis 1:29</a>). Sustained by the fruit and leaves of the tree of life, the saved will experience unfailing youth and vigor throughout eternity!

            <h2>What does Paul say about the glory of heaven?</h2>
            <p>
              But as it is written, <em>Eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither have entered into the heart of man</em>, the things which God hath prepared for them that love him. <cite><b>1 Corinthians 2:9</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              For I reckon that the <em>sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory</em> which shall be revealed in us. <cite><b>Romans 8:18</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              For which cause we faint not; but though our outward man perish, yet the inward man is renewed day by day. For <em>our light affliction, which is but for a moment, worketh for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory</em>; while we look not at the things which are seen, but at the things which are not seen: for the things which are seen are temporal; but the things which are not seen are eternal. <cite><b>2 Corinthians 4:16-18</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> The joy, bliss, and glory of heaven will be beyond our wildest dreams; in fact, Paul writes that no matter the trials and sufferings that life on earth brings, they are not comparable with the eternal glory of heaven!

            <h2>What does Revelation say about the saved?</h2>
            <p>
              <em>He that overcometh shall inherit all things</em>; and I will be his God, and he shall be my son. But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death. <cite><b>Revelation 21:7, 8</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              And <em>they overcame him by the blood of the Lamb</em>, and by the word of their testimony; and they loved not their lives unto the death. <cite><b>Revelation 12:11</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              These are they which were not defiled with women; for they are virgins. These are they <em>which follow the Lamb whithersoever he goeth</em>. These were redeemed from among men, being the firstfruits unto God and to the Lamb. <cite><b>Revelation 14:4</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              And the Spirit and the bride say, Come. And let him that heareth say, Come. And <em>let him that is athirst come</em>. And <em>whosoever will, let him take the water of life freely</em>. <cite><b>Revelation 22:17</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> Those who overcome sin will inherit all things. And how do they overcome? By the blood of the Lamb. The Bible is clear that my only hope of overcoming the defiling sin in my heart is through the power of Jesus working in my life. There is no other way. The whole reason why Jesus left the courts of heaven to live a life of victory on earth and die a humiliating death on the cross on my behalf is because He longs to save me from the filthiness of sin (<a>Matthew 1:21</a>). And He gives this offer of salvation freely. Will I choose to renounce sin and follow the Lamb wherever He goes?

            <h2>What am I to do while waiting for God’s literal kingdom?</h2>
            <p>
              In those days came John the Baptist, preaching in the wilderness of Judaea, and saying, <em>Repent ye: for the kingdom of heaven is at hand</em>. <cite><b>Matthew 3:1, 2</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              And when he was demanded of the Pharisees, when the kingdom of God should come, he answered them and said, The kingdom of God cometh not with observation: neither shall they say, Lo here! or, lo there! for, behold, <em>the kingdom of God is within you</em>. <cite><b>Luke 17:20, 21</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              But <em>seek ye first the kingdom of God, and his righteousness</em>; and all these things shall be added unto you. <cite><b>Matthew 6:33</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              <em>Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done</em> in earth, as it is in heaven. <cite><b>Matthew 6:10</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> When John the Baptist said the kingdom of God is “at hand,” he meant that the spiritual kingdom is already available now! I can experience the love, joy, and peace of God’s spiritual kingdom in my life today when I accept Jesus and give Him the throne of my heart! If seeking His kingdom and righteousness becomes my first priority in life, He will provide everything else for me. May the prayer of Jesus in <a>Matthew 6:10</a> be the prayer of my heart every day of my life.

            <h2>What does Daniel see coming up out of the sea?</h2>
            <p>
              In the first year of Belshazzar king of Babylon Daniel had a dream and visions of his head upon his bed: then he wrote the dream, and told the sum of the matters. Daniel spake and said, I saw in my vision by night, and, behold, the four winds of the heaven strove upon the great sea. And <em>four great beasts came up from the sea</em>, diverse one from another. <cite><b>Daniel 7:1-3</b></cite>
            </p>
          </section>
          <section>
            <div>2</div>
            <h2>What is a beast in Bible prophecy?</h2>
            <p>
              Thus he said, The <em>fourth beast shall be the fourth kingdom upon earth</em>, which shall be diverse from all kingdoms, and shall devour the whole earth, and shall tread it down, and break it in pieces. <cite><b>Daniel 7:23</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> Beasts in Bible prophecy represent earthly kingdoms, and they are a fitting symbol because throughout history, these kingdoms have been distinguished by cruelty, force, and oppression. In contrast, Revelation portrays king Jesus as a Lamb (<a>Revelation 5:13; 12:11; 17:14</a>) because He is guided by love and gentleness. Instead of imposing His will by force, He stands at the door of the heart and knocks (<a>Revelation 3:20</a>), waiting to be let inside.

            <h2>What was the first beast Daniel saw?</h2>
            <p>
              The <em>first was like a lion</em>, and had eagle's wings: I beheld till the wings thereof were plucked, and it was lifted up from the earth, and made stand upon the feet as a man, and a man's heart was given to it. <cite><b>Daniel 7:4</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              The <em>king of Babylon</em> hath heard the report of them, and his hands waxed feeble: anguish took hold of him, and pangs as of a woman in travail. Behold, <em>he shall come up like a lion</em> from the swelling of Jordan unto the habitation of the strong: but I will make them suddenly run away from her: and who is a chosen man, that I may appoint over her? for who is like me? and who will appoint me the time? and who is that shepherd that will stand before me? <cite><b>Jeremiah 50:43, 44</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> The first beast coming up out of the sea was like a lion, which represented the kingdom of Babylon. In Daniel 2, the first kingdom represented by the head of gold was also Babylon (see “Europe’s Future Revealed”). The Bible operates on the principle of repetition where previously covered subjects are repeated and new details added, and so Daniel 7 covers the same kingdoms as Daniel 2, but adds more details to each.

              And behold another beast, a second, <em>like to a bear</em>, and it raised up itself on one side, and it had three ribs in the mouth of it between the teeth of it: and they said thus unto it, Arise, devour much flesh. <cite><b>Daniel 7:5</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> Babylon was eventually conquered by Medo-Persia, which is symbolized by a bear raised up on one side because this second empire was made up of two groups of people&mdash;the Medes, who came up first, and the Persians, who eventually became stronger. The three ribs in the mouth of the bear represent the three main powers conquered by Medo-Persia: Lydia, Babylon, and Egypt. By the way, in <a>Daniel 8:3</a> Medo-Persia is symbolized by a ram with two-horns, but one of them was higher than the other and came up last; then in <a>Daniel 8:20</a> this empire is called by name.

              After this I beheld, and lo another, <em>like a leopard</em>, which had upon the back of it four wings of a fowl; the beast had also four heads; and dominion was given to it. <cite><b>Daniel 7:6</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> The Medo-Persian empire was then conquered by Greece, which is symbolized by a leopard with four wings and four heads. Wings in the Bible represent speed (<a>Jeremiah 4:11-13</a>), and the four wings are a fitting representation for the speed with which Alexander the Great conquered. The four heads represent the four kingdoms into which the empire was divided when Alexanded died.

            </p>
            <p>
              And the <em>ten horns out of this kingdom are ten kings that shall arise</em>: and another shall rise after them; and he shall be diverse from the first, and he shall subdue three kings. <cite><b>Daniel 7:24</b></cite>

            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> Greece was eventually conquered by the Roman Empire, which is symbolized by the fourth beast with 10 horns. The 10 horns represent the 10 kingdoms into which Rome was eventually split by the barbarian tribes: Visigoths (Spain), Anglo-Saxons (England), Franks (France), Alemani (Germany), Burgundians (Switzerland), Lombards (Italy), Suevi (Portugal), Heruli, Ostrogoths, and Vandals. These are the same kingdoms that were represented by the 10 toes of the image in <a>Daniel 2:41-44</a>.

            <p>
              I beheld, and the same horn <em>made war with the saints</em>, and prevailed against them. <cite><b>Daniel 7:21</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              And the ten horns out of this kingdom are ten kings that shall arise: and another shall rise after them; and <em>he shall be diverse from the first</em>, and he shall subdue three kings. And he shall <em>speak great words against the most High</em>, and shall wear out the saints of the most High, and <em>think to change times and laws</em>: and <em>they shall be given into his hand until a time and times and the dividing of time</em>. <cite><b>Daniel 7:24, 25</b></cite>

              <b>Note:</b> The Bible gives nine clear characteristics to identify the antichrist:<br>
               a) the little horn would come up somewhere amomg the 10 kingdoms of Western Europe (<a>Daniel 7:8</a>), <br>
               b) it would have a man at its head speaking for it (<a>Daniel 7:8</a>), <br>
               c) it would uproot three kingdoms (<a>Daniel 7:8</a>), <br>

            <h2>What power fits these characteristics?</h2>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> Historians would be able to quickly identify the power being described because there is only one that fits them all&mdash;the papacy. Now it is important to emphasize that this is not a condemnation of Roman Catholics; rather, the Bible is pointing out a system&mdash;Catholicism. In other places the Bible also points out the faults of the Jewish and Protestant faiths. Moreover, God has devoted Christians in all churches, including the Roman Catholic church. It is also true that the papacy has done many good deeds for the poor and the needy, but she has also committed serious errors that the Bible clearly points out in Daniel and in Revelation. God must sometimes chasten and rebuke because He wants us to be aware of error and compromise, and people who are truly loyal to Him will heed His warnings, no matter the faith. With this in mind, let’s examine each of the nine characteristics.
              <br><br>
              <em>a) It came up among the 10 kingdoms of Western Europe.</em> The papal power is in the heart of Western Europe in Rome, Italy.
              <br><br>
              <em>b) It would have a man at its head speaking for it.</em> The papacy has the pope at its head who speaks for it.
              <br><br>
              <em>c) It would uproot three kingdoms.</em> Most of the 10 kingdoms of Western Europe supported the papacy, but three of them did not: the Heruli, the Ostrogoths, and the Vandals. These had to be destroyed before the papacy could rise to power. The Heruli were eradicated in 493, the Vandals in 534, and the power of the Ostrogoths was curtailed in 538.
              <br><br>
              <em>d) It would emerge from the fourth kingdom&mdash;the pagan Roman Empire.</em> The papacy is a continuation of the pagan Roman Empire, and historians attest to this. “The mighty Catholic Church was little more than the Roman Empire baptized. ... The very capital of the old Roman Empire became the capital of the Christian empire. The office of Pontifex Maximus was continued in that of the pope.”<sup>1</sup> “Whatever Roman elements the barbarians and Arians left ... [came] under the protection of the Bishop of Rome, who was the chief person there after the emperor’s disappearance. ... The Roman church ... pushed itself into the place of the Roman World-Empire, of which it is the actual continuation.”<sup>2</sup>
              <br><br>
              <em>e) It would make war with the saints.</em> It is no secret that the Roman Catholic church killed millions of people whose religious convictions differed from hers, especially during the Dark Ages. “That the Church of Rome has shed more innocent blood than any other institution that has ever existed among mankind, will be questioned by no Protestant who has a competent knowledge of history.”<sup>3</sup>
              <br><br>
              <em>f) It would be different from the 10 other kingdoms.</em> The papacy is different from the other secular powers in Europe in that it rose to power as a religious power.
              <br><br>
              <em>g) It would persecute the saints for “a time and times and the dividing of time.”</em> In the Bible a time is a year, times is two years, and half a time is half of a year, so this is a total of three and a half years. The Amplified Bible actually translates it as "three and one-half years."<sup>4</sup> This same period is also mentioned as 42 months in <a>Revelation 11:2; 13:5</a>, as well as 1,260 days in <a>Revelation 11:3; 12:6, 14</a> (the Jewish calendar is 30 days). In the Bible one prophetic day equals one literal year (<a>Ezekiel 4:6; Numbers 14:34</a>), so the little horn would have power to persecute the saints for 1,260 years. The papacy gained this power in 538 when the Ostrogoths, the last of the opposing kingdoms, were uprooted, and it ruled until 1798 when Napoleon’s general, Berthier, took the pope captive. Thus, its 1,260 year rule from 538 to 1798 is a direct fulfillment of this prophecy. <a>Matthew 24:21, 22</a> mentions this period of persecution against the saints, saying no soul would have survived it if God did not shorten it, but He did shorten it, and the persecution ended well before 1798.
              <br><br>
              <em>h) It would “speak great words against” (blaspheme) God.</em> <a>Daniel 7:25</a> (“speak great words against the most High”) is echoed by <a>Revelation 13:5</a> (“speaking great things and blasphemies”), so speaking great words is equivalent to blasphemy, which has two definitions in the Bible: <br>
              &emsp; &bull; 1) claiming to forgive sins (<a>Luke 5:21</a>), and <br>
              &emsp; &bull; 2) claiming to be God (<a>John 10:33</a>). <br>
              The papacy claims both of these things. “Does the Priest truly forgive the sins, or does he only declare that they are remitted? The Priest does really and truly forgive the sins in virtue of the power given to him by Christ.”<sup>5</sup> “We [the popes] hold upon this earth the place of God Almighty.”<sup>6</sup> “The pope is not only the representative of Jesus Christ, but he is Jesus Christ, Himself, hidden under the veil of flesh.”<sup>7</sup>
              <br><br>
              <em>i) It would attempt “to change times and laws.”</em> This is a reference to the law of God, and there is only one commandment that is both a time and a law: the fourth commandment about keeping the seventh day Sabbath holy. Furthermore, there is also only one Lawgiver (<a>James 4:12</a>), the Creator of heaven and earth, and no one can actually change the law of God (<a>Luke 16:17</a>), but the papacy has thought to transfer the Sabbath from Saturday to Sunday, the first day of the week. In its catechisms, it has also removed the second commandment against the veneration of images, shortened the fourth commandment, and divided the tenth commandment into two. In other words, there are now two apparent lawgivers, with two different days of worship, but only one of them is legitimate&mdash;the seventh-day Sabbath of the Almighty God.<br><br>

              There is no other organization but the papacy that fits all nine of the characteristics of the little horn power of Daniel 7. And this is not a new idea either because every Protestant reformer believed the papacy was the antichrist.<sup>8</sup> <br><br>

            <h2>Aren’t there many antichrists?</h2>
            <p>
              Little children, it is the last time: and as ye have heard that <em>antichrist shall come, even now are there many antichrists</em>; whereby we know that it is the last time. They went out from us, but they were not of us; for if they had been of us, they would no doubt have continued with us: but they went out, that they might be made manifest that they were not all of us. But ye have an unction from the Holy One, and ye know all things. I have not written unto you because ye know not the truth, but because ye know it, and that no lie is of the truth. Who is a liar but he that denieth that Jesus is the Christ? He is antichrist, that denieth the Father and the Son. <cite><b>1 John 2:18-22</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> It’s true that through out history many antichrists have worked against God, but there is only one entity, the papacy, that fulfills the traits of the little horn power, which makes the following claim, “we declare, we proclaim, we define that it is absolutely necessary for salvation that every human creature be subject to the Roman Pontiff,”<sup>8</sup> despite the fact that salvation is a gift, by grace through faith (<a>Ephesians 2:8, 9</a>). Some may expect the antichrist to openly oppose God, but the word “antichrist” has two meanings: opposition to Christ or acting in place of Christ. Ultimately, both actions seek to supplant God’s position and authority, which is a continuation of Satan’s original aim in heaven.
              <br><br>
              Satan’s work of deception in the last days is much more effective when the antichrist appears spiritual and holy, but God, in His love, gave the prophecies of Daniel and Revelation to expose these deceptions so that people are not mislead. Many will follow antichrist (<a>Revelation 13:3</a>) thinking they are following Jesus, but those who test every teaching by the Bible (<a>Isaiah 8:20</a>) will follow the Lamb (<a>Revelation 14:4</a>).

            <p>
              These were more noble than those in Thessalonica, in that they received the word with all readiness of mind, and <em>searched the scriptures daily, whether those things were so</em>. <cite><b>Acts 17:11</b></cite>

            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> When encountering a new teaching it’s crucial not to take someone else’s word, but to study the topic for myself to see if it’s in harmony with the Bible.

            <h2>What promise does Revelation give?</h2>
            <p>
              And <em>they overcame him by the blood of the Lamb</em>, and by the word of their testimony; and they loved not their lives unto the death. <cite><b>Revelation 12:11</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              <em>Abide in me, and I in you</em>. As the branch cannot bear fruit of itself, except it abide in the vine; no more can ye, except ye abide in me. I am the vine, ye are the branches: He that abideth in me, and I in him, the same bringeth forth much fruit: for <em>without me ye can do nothing</em>. <cite><b>John 15:4, 5</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              Then spake Jesus again unto them, saying, <em>I am the light of the world: he that followeth me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life</em>. <cite><b>John 15:4, 5</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> The good news is Satan is a defeated foe. Jesus has already won the battle between good and evil on the cross, and those who overcome Satan in the last days will do it only by the grace and power of Jesus in their lives. Jesus is the Light, and it is my privilege to know and follow Him by daily reading His love letter to me&mdash;the Bible; it will illuminate my path and expose darkness because Jesus does not want anyone to be deceived.

            <h2>How does the Bible describe the beast?</h2>
            <p>
              And I stood upon the sand of the sea, and saw a beast <em>rise up out of the sea</em>, having seven heads and ten horns, and upon his horns ten crowns, and <em>upon his heads the name of blasphemy</em>. And the beast which I saw was <em>like unto a leopard, and his feet were as the feet of a bear, and his mouth as the mouth of a lion</em>: and the <em>dragon gave him his power, and his seat, and great authority</em>.
              <br><br>
              And I saw <em>one of his heads as it were wounded to death</em>; and <em>his deadly wound was healed</em>: and <em>all the world wondered after the beast</em>. And they worshipped the dragon which gave power unto the beast: and they worshipped the beast, saying, Who is like unto the beast? who is able to make war with him? And there was given unto him a <em>mouth speaking great things and blasphemies</em>; and <em>power was given unto him to continue forty and two months</em>. And he <em>opened his mouth in blasphemy against God</em>, to blaspheme his name, and his tabernacle, and them that dwell in heaven.
              <br><br>
              And it was given unto him to <em>make war with the saints, and to overcome them</em>: and <em>power was given him over all kindreds, and tongues, and nations</em>. And <em>all that dwell upon the earth shall worship him</em>, whose names are not written in the book of life of the Lamb slain from the foundation of the world. If any man have an ear, let him hear. He that leadeth into captivity shall go into captivity: he that killeth with the sword must be killed with the sword. Here is the patience and the faith of the saints. <cite><b>Revelation 13:1-10</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              Here is wisdom. Let him that hath understanding count the number of the beast: for it is the number of a man; and <em>his number is six hundred threescore and six</em>. <cite><b>Revelation 13:18</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> Before identifying the mark of the beast, we must first identify the beast itself. The Bible gives 11 characteristics: <br>
              a) It rises out of the sea (<a>Revelation 13:1</a>), <br>
              b) It is the composite of the four beasts of Daniel 7 (<a>Revelation 13:2</a>), <br>
              c) The dragon gives it power and authority (<a>Revelation 13:2</a>), <br>
              d) It receives a deadly wound (<a>Revelation 13:3</a>), <br>
              e) Its deadly wound is healed (<a>Revelation 13:3</a>), <br>
              f) It becomes a strong political power (<a>Revelation 13:3, 7</a>), <br>
              g) It becomes a strong religious power (<a>Revelation 13:3, 8</a>), <br>
              h) It speaks blasphemy against God (<a>Revelation 13:1, 5, 6</a>), <br>
              i) It wars against the saints and overcomes them (<a>Revelation 13:7</a>), <br>
              j) It rules for 42 months (<a>Revelation 13:5</a>), <br>
              k) It has the mysterious number of 666 (<a>Revelation 13:18</a>).

            <h2>What power is represented here?</h2>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> The Bible often operates on the principle of repetition where previously covered subjects are repeated and new details added. If some of these characteristics described in Revelation 13 sound familiar it’s because the beast described here is the same power as the little horn of Daniel 7, which we previously learned represents the papacy (see “Who Is the Antichrist?”). Now it’s worth repeating that this is not a condemnation of Roman Catholics; rather, the Bible is pointing out a system&mdash;Catholicism. In other places the Bible also points out the faults of the Jewish and Protestant faiths. Moreover, God has devoted Christians in all churches, including the Roman Catholic church. It’s also true that the papacy has done many good deeds for the poor and the needy, but she has also committed serious errors that the Bible clearly points out in Daniel and in Revelation. God must sometimes chasten and rebuke because He wants us to be aware of error and compromise, and people who are truly loyal to Him will heed His warnings, no matter the faith. With this in mind, let’s examine each of the 11 characteristics:
              <br><br>
              <em>a) It rises out of the sea.</em> We previously learned that waters represent densely populated areas (<a>Revelation 17:15</a>), and since the papacy arose in Rome, Italy&mdash;a peninsula in the heart of Western Europe&mdash;it fits this point.
              <br><br>
              <em>b) It is the composite of the four beasts of Daniel 7.</em> The beast is the composite of these beasts (<a>Daniel 7:4-7</a>) because it incorporates various beliefs and practices from all four empires (see “Who Is the Antichrist?”), and the papacy fits this point too. “In a certain respect, she [the papacy] has copied her organization from that of the Roman Empire, has preserved and made fruitful the philosophical intuitions of Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle, borrowed from both Barbarians and the Byzantine Roman Empire, but always remains herself, thoroughly digesting all elements drawn from external sources.” <sup>1</sup>
              <br><br>
              <em>c) The dragon gives it power and authority.</em> The dragon can be identified by reading <a>Revelation 12:1-6</a> where it talks about a pregnant woman about to deliver and the dragon hoping to devour the baby at birth; however, the child evades the dragon by being caught up to heaven. This is an obvious reference to Jesus, whom Herod tried to kill by slaying all the babies in Bethlehem (<a>Matthew 2:16</a>). Herod was acting under his authority as a king of Rome, so the dragon represents pagan Rome, but the real power behind Herod’s plot was the devil (<a>Revelation 12:7-9</a>) who likes to act through various governments to move his ugly work forward. The Roman Empire eventually fell in 476, and its power and capital city were inherited by the papacy. “The Roman Church ... pushed itself into the place of the Roman World-Empire, of which it is the actual continuation. ... The Pope ... is Caesar's successor.” <sup>2</sup> “The mighty Catholic Church was little more than the Roman Empire baptised. Rome was transformed as well as converted. The very capital of the old Empire became the capital of the Christian Empire. The office of Pontifex Maximus was continued in that of Pope.” <sup>3</sup>
              <br><br>
              <em>d) It receives a deadly wound.</em> This prophecy was fulfilled when Napoleon's general, Alexander Berthier, took Pope Pius VI captive in 1798. When the pope died in 1799, “half Europe thought ... that without the Pope the Papacy was dead.” <sup>4</sup>
              <br><br>
              <em>e) Its deadly wound is healed.</em> The power and influence of the papacy has been increasing steadily over the years, and today she is not only one of the most powerful religious organizations in the world, but she has strong political influence as well. When the wound is completely healed, <a>Revelation 13:3</a> says the entire world will give homage to it.
              <br><br>
              <em>f) It becomes a strong political power.</em> <a>Revelation 13:7</a> says the papacy will have political power and influence over all of the nations of the world. The papacy’s political rise started when Italian dictator Benito Mussolini signed a treaty with the Vatican establishing it as a political state and protecting it from interference by the Italian government. Even though Vatican City is the smallest country in the world, it now has ambassadors (called “papal nuncios”) in every part of the globe. In 1984, it established diplomatic relations with the United States, and in 2015 Pope Francis spoke to a joint session of the U.S. Congress for the first time ever. No doubt, the wound has been healing.
              <br><br>
              <em>g) It becomes a strong religious power.</em> <a>Revelation 13:8</a> says the papacy will be worshiped, which implies religious power and influence, by the entire world. Today the pope is respected by faiths across the religious spectrum. In 2014 Francis led an ecumenical worship service that was attended by Anglican, Lutheran, Methodist, and Orthodox representatives. He has also hosted a prayer summit at the Vatican with Israeli and Palesinian leaders. Cardinal Timothy Dolan had this to say: “The more he tries to de-emphasize the prestige and the power of the papacy, ... the more people pay attention to him.” <sup>5</sup>
              <br><br>
              <em>h) It speaks blasphemy against God.</em> Blasphemy is defined as claiming to forgive sins (<a>Luke 5:21</a>) and claiming to be God (<a>John 10:33</a>). The papacy fits these points because her priests claim to forgive sins and the popes claim to be Christ (see question 10 of “Who Is the Antichrist?”).
              <br><br>
              <em>i) It wars against the saints and overcomes them.</em> The papacy persecuted and killed millions of people during the Dark Ages for following their conscience.
              <br><br>
              <em>j) It rules for 42 months.</em> The papacy ruled for 42 prophetic months, which equates to 1,260 years, from 538 to 1798 (see question 10 of “Who Is the Antichrist?”). During this time the papacy had power to persecute and kill anyone who followed the Bible over its own traditions, and as a result, many had to flee their native countries or even escape into the wilderness. This was clearly foretold in <a>Revelation 12:6, 14</a> and vividly fulfilled, for example, in the history of the Huguenots who fled France and the Waldensians who escaped into the Cottian Alps because they refused to compromise with the unbiblical teachings of the Roman Catholic Church.
              <br><br>
              <em>k) It has the mysterious number of 666.</em> <a>Revelation 13:8</a> refers to it as “the number of a man,” and <a>Revelation 15:2</a> says “the number of his name.” What is the official name of the pope? According to a Catholic quote: “The title of the pope of Rome is Vicarius Filii Dei.” <sup>6</sup> The Douay versions of the Bible have a footnote for <a>Revelation 13:8</a> that says, “The numeral letters of his name shall make up this number.” Notice that when the Roman numeral values of the letters of the pope’s official name are added up they equal 666 (note that V and U each equal five in Roman numerals). <br>
              V&ensp; I&ensp; C&ensp; A&ensp; R&ensp; I&ensp; U&ensp; S&emsp;&emsp; F&ensp; I&ensp; L&ensp; I&ensp; I&emsp;&emsp; D&ensp; E&ensp; I <br>
              5&ensp; 1&nbsp;100&nbsp; 0&ensp; 0&ensp; 1&ensp; 5&ensp; 0&emsp;&emsp; 0&ensp;1&nbsp; 50&nbsp; 1&ensp;1&emsp;&ensp;500&nbsp; 0&ensp; 1&ensp; = 666 <br><br>
              By the way, the Latin title “Vicarius Filii Dei” means “substitute of Son of God,” which is an echo of the word “antichrist,” which can be translated as “in place of God.” To summarize, there is no other power in history that could fit all 11 of these identifiers apart from the papacy, and only God could have prophesied this in advance. <br><br>

            <h2>What is God’s sign of authority?</h2>
            <p>
              Moreover also <em>I gave them my sabbaths, to be a sign between me and them</em>, that they might know that I am the LORD that sanctify them. <cite><b>Ezekiel 20:12</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              Wherefore the children of Israel shall keep the sabbath, to <em>observe the sabbath throughout their generations, for a perpetual covenant. It is a sign between me and the children of Israel for ever</em>: for in six days the LORD made heaven and earth, and on the seventh day he rested, and was refreshed. <cite><b>Exodus 31:16, 17</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              Remember the sabbath day, to keep it holy. Six days shalt thou labour, and do all thy work: but the seventh day is the sabbath of <em>the LORD thy God</em>: in it thou shalt not do any work, thou, nor thy son, nor thy daughter, thy manservant, nor thy maidservant, nor thy cattle, nor thy stranger that is within thy gates. For in six days <em>the LORD made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that in them is</em>, and rested the seventh day: wherefore the LORD blessed the sabbath day, and hallowed it. <cite><b>Exodus 20:8-11</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> The fourth commandment about the Sabbath contains the three basic elements of a seal: the name (the Lord), title (your God), and territory (heaven and earth), so the seventh day Sabbath is a sign of God as the Creator of the universe, as well as the Sanctifier of those who choose to follow Him. It represents His authority to rule as Creator and Savior. <a>Revelation 7:1-3</a> says that in the last days His servants will have the seal of God, the Sabbath, on their foreheads, which represents the mind (<a>Hebrews 10:16</a>), meaning they’ve made a decision to surrender their lives to Jesus&mdash;to follow Him as the authority over their lives because He created and saved them. (By the way, the words seal, mark, sign, and token are used interchangeably in the Bible, see <a>Genesis 17:11; Ezekiel 9:4; Romans 4:11; Revelation 7:3) <a>Hebrews 4:4-10</a> says there remains a rest day for those who entered His rest (received salvation); this rest day is a symbol of salvation because we can stop trying to be saved by our works and rest in the righteousness of Jesus instead!

            <h2>What does the papacy say is her mark of authority?</h2>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> Notice the following excerpts from Catholic catechisms: “Question: Have you any other way of proving that the Church has power to institute festivals of precept? Answer: Had she not such power, she could not have done that in which all modern religionists agree with her&mdash;she could not have substituted the observance of Sunday the first day of the week, for the observance of Saturday the seventh day, a change for which there is no Scriptural authority.” <sup>7</sup> “Question: Why do we observe Sunday instead of Saturday? Answer: We observe Sunday instead of Saturday because the Catholic Church transferred the solemnity from Saturday to Sunday.” <sup>8</sup>
              <br><br>
              Here is another quote: “The church is above the Bible, and this transference of Sabbath observance is proof of that fact.” <sup>9</sup> Cardinal Gibbons (a cardinal is a senior officer in the Catholic Church) had this to say about Sunday-keeping: “Of course the Catholic Church claims that the change was her act. It could not have been otherwise, as none in those days would have dreamed of doing anything, in matters spiritual, ecclesiastical and religious without her. This act is a mark of her ecclesiastical power and authority in religious matters.” <sup>10</sup>
              <br><br>
              The papacy itself is saying that it “changed” the Sabbath from Saturday to Sunday, the pagan day of sun worship, and virtually all churches accepted the new holy day. Therefore, it claims that this act is the mark of her power and authority.

            <h2>Did God predict this attempted change?</h2>
            <p>
              And he shall speak great words against the most High, and shall wear out the saints of the most High, and <em>think to change times and laws</em>: and they shall be given into his hand until a time and times and the dividing of time. <cite><b>Daniel 7:25</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> We learned previously that one of the characteristics of the papacy would be trying to change times and laws (see “Who Is the Antichrist?”). With regard to changing laws, in her catechisms she has removed the second commandment prohibiting the veneration of images, shortened the fourth commandment about the seventh Sabbath so that it could refer to any day, and divided the tenth commandment into two. Regarding changing times, she has attempted to change the time of the Sabbath from the seventh day to the first, as well as the timing of the Sabbath hours themselves (from sundown Friday night to sundown Saturday night as God commanded, see <a>Leviticus 23:32</a>) to the pagan Roman custom of counting the day from midnight to midnight. Of course, none of these changes are legitimate, because there is only one Lawgiver (<a>James 4:12</a>), and His word cannot change (<a>Matthew 24:35</a>).

            <h2>What question does the papacy asks Protestants?</h2>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> “You will tell me that Saturday was the Jewish Sabbath, but that the Christian Sabbath has been changed to Sunday. Changed! But by whom? Who has authority to change an express commandment of Almighty God? When God has spoken and said, Thou shalt keep holy the seventh day, who shall dare to say, Nay, thou mayest work and do all manner of worldly business on the seventh day; but thou shalt keep holy the first day in its stead? This is a most important question, which I know not how you can answer.
              <br><br>
              “You are a Protestant, and you profess to go by the Bible and the Bible only; and yet in so important a matter as the observance of one day in seven as a holy day, you go against the plain letter of the Bible, and put another day in the place of that day which the Bible has commanded. The command to keep holy the seventh day is one of the Ten Commandments; you believe that the other nine are still binding; who gave you authority to tamper with the fourth? If you are consistent with your own principles, if you really follow the Bible and the Bible only, you ought to be able to produce some portion of the New Testament in which this fourth commandment is expressly altered.” <sup>11</sup>
              <br><br>
              “You may read the Bible from Genesis to Revelation, and you will not find a single line authorizing the sanctification of Sunday. The Scriptures enforce the religious observance of Saturday, a day which [Catholics] never sanctify.” <sup>12</sup> <br><br>

            <h2>What warnings does God give regarding His law?</h2>
            <p>
               <em>For the priest's lips should keep knowledge, and they should seek the law at his mouth: for he is the messenger of the LORD of hosts. But ye are departed out of the way; ye have caused many to stumble at the law</em>; ye have corrupted the covenant of Levi, saith the LORD of hosts. Therefore have I also made you contemptible and base before all the people, according as ye have not kept my ways, but have been partial in the law. <cite><b>Malachi 2:7-9</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              That this is a rebellious people, lying children, <em>children that will not hear the law of the LORD</em>: which say to the seers, See not; and to the prophets, <em>Prophesy not unto us right things, speak unto us smooth things, prophesy deceits</em>. <cite><b>Isaiah 30:9, 10</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              The earth mourneth and fadeth away, the world languisheth and fadeth away, the haughty people of the earth do languish. The earth also is defiled under the inhabitants thereof; <em>because they have transgressed the laws, changed the ordinance, broken the everlasting covenant. Therefore hath the curse devoured the earth, and they that dwell therein are desolate</em>: therefore the inhabitants of the earth are burned, and few men left. <cite><b>Isaiah 24:4-6</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              <em>Her priests have violated my law, and have profaned mine holy things: they have put no difference between the holy and profane</em>, neither have they shewed difference between the unclean and the clean, and <em>have hid their eyes from my sabbaths, and I am profaned among them</em>. ... Therefore have I poured out mine indignation upon them; I have consumed them with the fire of my wrath: their own way have I recompensed upon their heads, saith the Lord GOD. <cite><b>Ezekiel 22:26, 31</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> God warns religious leaders who ignore His law and say that some commandments do not matter because such actions cause many people to stumble, but He also warns people who do not desire to learn about the law and want smooth fables to be preached, instead. Why? Because changing or refusing to follow God’s law has real consequences, including tragedy and upheaval on the earth. And this is not because God delights in heartache and misery, but because His law of love is there to protect from it. When it’s continually ignored, He will eventually stop pleading and let the consequences of rebellion play out. God cares about the truth being preached because He does not want anyone to be deceived, and so Ezekiel warns that those who teach there is no difference between sacred things, such as God’s holy day, and common things, such as Sunday, will one day face His indignation.

            <p>
              And he causeth all, both small and great, rich and poor, free and bond, to <em>receive a mark in their right hand, or in their foreheads</em>. <cite><b>Revelation 13:16</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              Therefore shall ye lay up these my words in your heart and in your soul, and bind them for a sign upon your hand, <em>that they may be as frontlets between your eyes</em>. <cite><b>Deuteronomy 11:18</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              This is the covenant that I will make with them after those days, saith the Lord, I will put my laws into their hearts, and <em>in their minds will I write them</em>. <cite><b>Hebrews 10:16</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              <em>Whatsoever thy hand findeth to do, do it with thy might</em>; for there is no work, nor device, nor knowledge, nor wisdom, in the grave, whither thou goest. <cite><b>Ecclesiastes 9:10</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> The forehead is the location of the frontal lobe, the area of the brain responsible for decision making, and in the Bible it represents the mind. When God told the Israelites to place His law on their foreheads He wanted the law to be in their minds. Likewise, the mark of the beast in the forehead (mind) is a decision to keep Sunday due to a conviction that it’s holy. Regarding being marked on the hand, in the Bible the hand represents work, so it’s accepting Sunday-keeping though one’s actions for practical reasons (convenience, job, family), not because of a conviction that it’s holy. In other words, the mark of the beast is a marking of oneself by accepting the beast’s mark, Sunday, either through conviction or actions, as opposed to God’s seal, the true seventh day Sabbath. Even though it’s not an obvious physical mark, God will know who has His seal and who has the beast’s mark (<a>2 Timothy 2:19</a>).

            <h2>Does anyone have the mark of the beast now?</h2>
            <p>
              And <em>he causeth all</em>, both small and great, rich and poor, free and bond, to receive a mark in their right hand, or in their foreheads: and <em>that no man might buy or sell, save he that had the mark</em>, or the name of the beast, or the number of his name. <cite><b>Revelation 13:16, 17</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> No one will have the mark of the beast until Sunday worship is enforced by law. A time will come when the issue of Sunday worship will be so prominent that those who don’t go along will be cut off from the financial system, unable to buy or sell. When Sunday keeping is enforced by law that is when those who worship on the papacy’s counterfeit holy day will receive her mark, but those who follow Jesus and obey Him will worship on Satuday, His holy Sabbath day, and receive His mark. But waiting until the end to keep the true Sabbath is a mistake. Anyone who hopes to refuse the beasts’s mark in the future should keep Jesus’ true Sabbath now, and whoever decides to obey Him will receive His power to do so (<a>Acts 5:32</a>). Without Him, I can do nothing (<a>John 15:5</a>), but with Him all things are possible (<a>Mark 10:27</a>).

            <h2>What message does God give the world in the last days?</h2>
            <p>
              <em>If thou turn away thy foot from the sabbath, from doing thy pleasure on my holy day; and call the sabbath a delight, the holy of the LORD, honourable; and shalt honour him</em>, not doing thine own ways, nor finding thine own pleasure, nor speaking thine own words: <em>then shalt thou delight thyself in the LORD</em>; and I will cause thee to ride upon the high places of the earth, and feed thee with the heritage of Jacob thy father: for the mouth of the LORD hath spoken it. <cite><b>Isaiah 58:13, 14</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              Saying with a loud voice, Fear God, and give glory to him; for the hour of his judgment is come: and <em>worship him that made</em> heaven, and earth, and the sea, and the fountains of waters. <cite><b>Revelation 14:7</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              And the third angel followed them, saying with a loud voice, <em>If any man worship the beast and his image, and receive his mark in his forehead, or in his hand, the same shall drink of the wine of the wrath of God</em>, which is poured out without mixture into the cup of his indignation; and he shall be tormented with fire and brimstone in the presence of the holy angels, and in the presence of the Lamb. <cite><b>Revelation 14:9, 10</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> God is asking His people to stop trampling on His holy day so He can bless them; in fact, the Sabbath itself is a blessing and a delight to those who keep it. Obviously, it’s an important issue to God, so much so that the three-point message He gives to all the earth in the last days (<a>Revelation 14:6-11</a>) begins with a call to worship God, the Creator, and it’s then culminated by a prominent warning against worshiping the beast and receiving his mark because it will be a life-or-death issue. The conflict between God and Lucifer started in heaven over the issue of worship because Lucifer wanted to be worshiped like the Creator God (see “Origin of Evil”), and it’s clear that worship will be central in the last days too. Will I worship the Creator God by observing His Sabbath or the beast by observing his counterfeit Sunday? Some may think it’s just a day, but it was also just a fruit that Adam and Eve ate in the garden of Eden. The day reveals the condition of the heart&mdash;either one that’s completely surrendered to Jesus or one that’s in rebellion against Him.

            <h2>What is the highest form of worship?</h2>
            <p>
              Know ye not, that to whom ye yield yourselves servants to obey, <em>his servants ye are to whom ye obey</em>; whether of sin unto death, or of obedience unto righteousness? <cite><b>Romans 6:16</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              If ye love me, <em>keep my commandments</em>. <cite><b>John 14:15</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              Here is the patience of the saints: here are they that <em>keep the commandments of God, and the faith of Jesus</em>. <cite><b>Revelation 14:12</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> The highest form worship is obedience; whom we obey is whom we worship and serve. Love for Jesus is made evident by a willingness to obey Him. The saints who refuse to worship the beast and receive his mark will do it only because of their deep love for Jesus, which will be clearly manifested in their obedience to His Sabbath day.

            <p>
              Not everyone who says to Me, “Lord, Lord,” shall enter the kingdom of heaven, but <em>he who does the will of My Father in heaven</em>. Many will say to Me in that day, “Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied in Your name, cast out demons in Your name, and done many wonders in Your name?” And then I will declare to them, “I never knew you; depart from Me, you <em>who practice lawlessness</em>!” <cite><b>Matthew 7:21-23, NKJV</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              This people draweth nigh unto me with their mouth, and honoureth me with their lips; but their heart is far from me. But <em>in vain they do worship me, teaching for doctrines the commandments of men</em>. <cite><b>Matthew 15:8, 9</b></cite>

            <p>
              For as the body without the spirit is dead, so <em>faith without works is dead</em> also.
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> People can claim to worship God, but their trampling of God’s law (lawlessness) will tell a different story because their deeds will be contrary to their profession. Any worship of God that elevates man-made laws above and contrary to the law of God is false worship, and it’s especially dangerous when this is propogated by a religious system. Now this isn’t anything new, or exclusive to Roman Catholicism, because the Jewish leaders of Jesus’ day were guilty of it too. Anyone, regardless of his or her faith, can fall into it, because the human heart is deceitful and hard to decipher (<a>Jeremiah 17:9<a>). That’s why James says that faith without works (obedience) is dead. While I’m not saved by my obedience (salvation is only by the righteousness of Jesus), obedience is evidence that I am saved, and it’s primarily evidence for me because God already knows the true condition of my heart (<a>Psalm 139:23, 24</a>).

            <p>
              These are they which were not defiled with women; for they are virgins. These are they which <em>follow the Lamb whithersoever he goeth</em>. These were redeemed from among men, being the firstfruits unto God and to the Lamb. <cite><b>Revelation 14:4</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> Those who have refused the mark of the beast and have God’s seal, instead, will be in God’s eternal kingdom. Notice also that while the mark of the beast is either in the forehead or the hand, the seal of God is only placed in the forehead, meaning God is looking for allegiance only from those who are truly sincere in their worship of Him on His holy day.

            <h2>What does Jesus say about following Him?</h2>
            <p>
              And <em>other sheep I have, which are not of this fold</em>: them also I must bring, and they shall hear my voice; and there shall be one fold, and one shepherd. ... <em>My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me</em>. <cite><b>John 10:16, 27</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              Then spake Jesus again unto them, saying, I am the light of the world: <em>he that followeth me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life</em>. <cite><b>John 8:12</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              <em>Thy word is a lamp unto my feet</em>, and a light unto my path. <cite><b>Psalm 119:105</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> Jesus has His people in all faiths, and when they learn about His truth, they will recognize His voice calling out to them and will follow Him, no matter the cost. It may be a difficult decision to make, but the promise from Jesus is that those who follow Him will be blessed with the eternal light of truth that brings fullness of life right now (<a>John 10:10</a>)! This is why Paul and Silas were able to sing praises to God while in prison for their faith (<a>Acts 16:23-25</a>); even though their feet were shackled and their backs lacerated, their souls were filled with the enduring joy that is found only in Jesus!

            <h2>Is God a revealer of secrets?</h2>
            <p>
              Surely the Lord GOD will do nothing, but <em>he revealeth his secret unto his servants the prophets</em>. <cite><b>Amos 3:7</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              For this is good and acceptable in the sight of God our Savior, <em>who desires all men to be saved and to come to the knowledge of the truth</em>. <cite><b>1 Timothy 2:3, 4</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> The beautiful thing about God’s character is that He does not just know the future, but He also likes to reveal it ahead of time to strengthen our faith in Him and prepare us for what is to come. He does not want anyone to be lost due to a lack of knowledge about eternal realities, and He often uses prophets to bring such things to the attention of His people. John, the revelator, is one such prophet to whom God has revealed events that will transpire near the close of earth’s history.

            <h2>What power is symbolized first in Revelation 13?</h2>
            <p>
              And I stood upon the sand of the sea, and <em>saw a beast rise up out of the sea, having seven heads and ten horns, and upon his horns ten crowns, and upon his heads the name of blasphemy</em>. And the beast which I saw was like unto a leopard, and his feet were as the feet of a bear, and his mouth as the mouth of a lion: and the dragon gave him his power, and his seat, and great authority. And I saw one of his heads as it were wounded to death; and his deadly wound was healed: and all the world wondered after the beast. And they worshipped the dragon which gave power unto the beast: and they worshipped the beast, saying, Who is like unto the beast? who is able to make war with him? And there was given unto him a mouth speaking great things and blasphemies; and <em>power was given unto him to continue forty and two months</em>. And he opened his mouth in blasphemy against God, to blaspheme his name, and his tabernacle, and them that dwell in heaven.
              <br><br>
              And it was given unto him to make war with the saints, and to overcome them: and power was given him over all kindreds, and tongues, and nations. And all that dwell upon the earth shall worship him, whose names are not written in the book of life of the Lamb slain from the foundation of the world. If any man have an ear, let him hear. He that leadeth into captivity shall go into captivity: he that killeth with the sword must be killed with the sword. Here is the patience and the faith of the saints. <cite><b>Revelation 13:1-10</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> As we already learned in a previous study, the beast that came out of the sea is the Roman papacy, which had influence and power in the world for 42 months. The papacy received a deadly wound at the end of this period in 1798 when the pope was taken captive by Napoleon’s General Berthier (see “Mark of the Beast”).

            <h2>What is the second power symbolized in Revelation 13?</h2>
            <p>
              And I beheld another beast <em>coming up out of the earth</em>; and he had two horns like a lamb, and he spake as a dragon. <cite><b>Revelation 13:11</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> Verse 10 talked about the papal captivity that took place in 1798, and this second power is also seen emerging around that time. There is only one power that fits this time frame&mdash;the United States. It declared its independence in 1776, adopted the Constitution in 1787 and the Bill of Rights in 1791, and was recognized as a world power by 1798. An important detail mentioned in verse 11 is that it would arise “out of the earth,” as opposed to the sea. From <a>Revelation 17:5</a>, we know the sea represents areas of the world with large populations; therefore, the earth represents the opposite&mdash;an area that is sparsely populated. In other words, this second power could not arise out of the crowded nations of the Old World; it had to come out of a sparsely populated continent, which matches perfectly with the United States.

            <h2>How is it distinguished from other nations?</h2>
            <p>
              And I beheld another beast coming up out of the earth; and he had <em>two horns like a lamb</em>, and he spake as a dragon. <cite><b>Revelation 13:11</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> Horns represent kings, kingdoms, or governments (<a>Daniel 7:24; 8:21</a>). In this case, they represent the two governing principles of the United States: civil and religious liberty. These principles have also been described as republicanism (a government without a king) and Protestantism (a church without a pope). Unlike other nations described in Daniel and Revelation, this one is distinguished by an absence of crowns, signifying a republican form of government, as opposed to a monarchy. Throughout history, it was also common for nations to tax people to support a state religion and oppress religious dissidents. The pilgrims on the Mayflower, as well as many other settlers that followed, were fleeing religious persecution, and so the United States was established with an entirely new mindset: the separation of church and state.

            <h2>Will the United States experience a change?</h2>
            <p>
              And I beheld another beast coming up out of the earth; and he had two horns like a lamb, and he <em>spake as a dragon</em>. <cite><b>Revelation 13:11</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> We learn in <a>Revelation 20:2</a> that the dragon is Satan, who uses various earthly powers to persecute and destroy God’s people (<a>Revelation 12:13</a>). Since his rebellion in heaven, his aim has been to be like God&mdash;to usurp God and force people to worship him instead (<a>Isaiah 14:12-14</a>). So what does it mean for a nation to speak like a dragon? A nation “speaks” through its legislation, so to speak like a dragon means there will come a day when the United States, under the influence of Satan, will pass laws enforcing false worship.

            <h2>Does the Bible give more details?</h2>
            <p>
              And he <em>exerciseth all the power of the first beast</em> before him, and <em>causeth the earth and them which dwell therein to worship the first beast</em>, whose deadly wound was healed. And he <em>doeth great wonders, so that he maketh fire come down from heaven on the earth</em> in the sight of men, and <em>deceiveth them that dwell on the earth by the means of those miracles</em> which he had power to do in the sight of the beast; saying to them that dwell on the earth, that they should make an image to the beast, which had the wound by a sword, and did live. <cite><b>Revelation 13:12-14</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> The United States will exercise all the power of the first beast, the papacy, meaning it will imitate it, becoming a persecuting power and forcing people to go against their conscience. The verse goes on to say that the United States will use its power to lead the other nations of the world in forcing allegiance to the papacy. The question of worship will be the central issue in the last days. Will it be my Creator and Redeemer, Jesus Christ, or the antichrist? Every person will make a decision to worship one or the other.
              <br><br>
              The call to align with the antichrist will appear genuinely spiritual and will be backed up by miracles, deceiving many, and those who refuse to go along will be made to appear divisive, stubborn, legalistic, and unpatriotic. All of this may seem shocking and outlandish, but Jesus does not lie and His words never fail (<a>Titus 1:2</a>). He tells us these things ahead of time, so that when they do come to pass, we may believe (<a>John 14:29</a>).

              And deceiveth them that dwell on the earth by the means of those miracles which he had power to do in the sight of the beast; saying to them that dwell on the earth, that they should <em>make an image to the beast</em>, which had the wound by a sword, and did live. <cite><b>Revelation 13:14</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> The United States will make an image to the beast (imitate it) by legislating religious worship and forcing people to obey them or face imprisonment and, ultimately, death. This is a copy (an image) of the church-state form of government employed by the papacy during the Middle Ages, when millions were killed for their faith. The United States will abandon its principle regarding the separation of church and state and, instead, combine civil government and apostate Protestantism in an unholy union to use its influence and power to support the papacy. Protestant America will appear spiritual and trustworthy, but it will be satanic in its conduct&mdash;a lamb-like beast (<a>Revelation 13:11</a>). With the coming together of church and state, an image to the beast will have formed, and the United States will then influence all the other countries of the world to follow its example, culminating in the entire world making an image to the beast and worshiping it.

            <h2>What will this ultimately lead to?</h2>
            <p>
              And he had power to give life unto the image of the beast, that the image of the beast should both speak, and <em>cause that as many as would not worship the image of the beast should be killed</em>. And he causeth all, both small and great, rich and poor, free and bond, to <em>receive a mark in their right hand, or in their foreheads</em>: and that <em>no man might buy or sell, save he that had the mark</em>, or the name of the beast, or the number of his name. <cite><b>Revelation 13:15-17</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              And the dragon was wroth with the woman, and <em>went to make war with the remnant of her seed, which keep the commandments of God, and have the testimony of Jesus Christ</em>. <cite><b>Revelation 12:17</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> Worshiping and obeying the beast will result in receiving the mark of the beast through the keeping of Sunday as a false holy day (see “Mark of the Beast”), as opposed to worshiping and obeying Jesus and receiving His mark by keeping Saturday, the seventh-day Sabbath. Those who choose to worship the beast will have chosen to obey the word of a human being, as opposed to the word of their Creator, Jesus Christ. The papacy testifies to this itself: “The church changed Sabbath to Sunday and all the world bows down and worships upon that day in silent obedience to the mandates of the Catholic Church.”<sup>1</sup>
              <br><br>
              As the leader of the international movement to force allegiance to the papacy, the United States will proceed to punish those who refuse to go along with its Sunday legislation by denying them the ability to buy or sell; eventually, it will impose a death sentence, which will become global. Despite all of this, the Bible promises that God will protect His people, and their food and water will be sure (<a>Isaiah 33:16; Psalm 34:7</a>).

            <h2>Has something similar happened in the past?</h2>
            <p>
              Nebuchadnezzar the king <em>made an image of gold</em>, whose height was threescore cubits, and the breadth thereof six cubits: he set it up in the plain of Dura, in the province of Babylon. <cite><b>Daniel 3:1</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              Then the princes, the governors, and captains, the judges, the treasurers, the counsellers, the sheriffs, and all the rulers of the provinces, were gathered together unto the dedication of the image that Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up; and they stood before the image that Nebuchadnezzar had set up. Then an herald cried aloud, <em>To you it is commanded, O people, nations, and languages</em>. That at what time ye hear the sound of the cornet, flute, harp, sackbut, psaltery, dulcimer, and all kinds of musick, ye <em>fall down and worship the golden image</em> that Nebuchadnezzar the king hath set up: and <em>whoso falleth not down and worshippeth shall the same hour be cast into the midst of a burning fiery furnace</em>. Therefore at that time, when all the people heard the sound of the cornet, flute, harp, sackbut, psaltery, and all kinds of musick, <em>all the people, the nations, and the languages, fell down and worshipped the golden image</em> that Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up. <cite><b>Daniel 3:3-7</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              Nebuchadnezzar spake and said unto them, Is it true, O Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, <em>do not ye serve my gods, nor worship the golden image which I have set up</em>? <cite><b>Daniel 3:14</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              If it be so, <em>our God whom we serve is able to deliver us from the burning fiery furnace</em>, and he will deliver us out of thine hand, O king. But if not, be it known unto thee, O king, that <em>we will not serve thy gods, nor worship the golden image which thou hast set up</em>. <cite><b>Daniel 3:17, 18</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> A very similar scenario played out in Babylon during the reign of Nebuchadnezzar. It also involved a universal command forcing all to worship an image, along with the death penalty for those who refused. Most went along, but there was a small group of friends who refused to compromise by violating God’s commandments. Their love for God was stronger than death (<a>Revelation 12:11</a>), and they chose to remain faithful to Him by the grace of God.

            <h2>How influential is the papacy today?</h2>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> The papacy has emerged to become the strongest religio-political power in the world. Almost every leading country has an official ambassador at the Vatican, including the United States. During Francis’ 2015 visit to the United States, President Obama personally welcomed the pope, and the White House said this was a symbol of the high level of respect America has for him.<sup>2</sup> The visit also marked the first ever address by a pope to a joint session of Congress in American history. Besides the papacy’s political influence, its religious influence is also unparalleled, spanning  across the religious spectrum. For example, in 2014 Francis presided over an ecumenical worship service, attended by Orthodox, Anglican, Lutheran, Methodist, and other Christian representatives, at which he put out a call for Christian unity.<sup>3</sup> According to Bible prophecy, the papacy’s influence will only increase as we approach the last days.

Such events could easily bring about a call for strong, specific laws to be enforced, and it’s not difficult to imagine a president of the United States using the country’s influence to promote such laws on a global scale in the guise of world peace and unity. But this unity will be based on compromise and error, not the truth. Those who refuse to compromise will be hated and labeled as fanatics, and eventually, in the interest of preserving peace and unity, destroying them will be considered as an act of service to God (<a>John 16:2</a>) by those who become deluded through a persistent refusal to accept the truth (<a>2 Thessalonians 2:10-12</a>).

            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> With world conditions turning unbearable, a global movement of turning back to God, with all joining in worship on Sunday, will be presented as the only solution. The movement will be supported by signs, wonders, and miracles performed by the power of Satan, resulting in a counterfeit revival in which every person will be encouraged, and later, forced, to participate by keeping the papacy’s counterfeit “holy” day&mdash;Sunday, instead of God’s true and holy seventh-day Sabbath, instituted since the creation of the world.
              <br><br>
              These signs and wonders will be so convincing that Satan will attempt to deceive even God’s people. Fallen spirits (angels) of Satan will appear as dead loved ones (<a>Revelation 18:23</a>), probably even as Bible prophets and apostles, claiming they are sent of God to urge all to unite in cooperation, but really, in error, with the beast. The pressure to enforce Sunday legislation will be intense, and some, especially those who have no interest in religion, may comply merely for economic or social reasons, such as resting in support of climate change.

              Then if any man shall say unto you, Lo, here is Christ, or there; <em>believe it not</em>. For there <em>shall arise false Christs, and false prophets, and shall shew great signs and wonders</em>; insomuch that, if it were possible, they shall deceive the very elect. <cite><b>Matthew 24:23, 24</b></cite>

              Ye are of your father the devil, and the lusts of your father ye will do. He was a murderer from the beginning, and abode not in the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he speaketh a lie, he speaketh of his own: for <em>he is a liar, and the father of it</em>. <cite><b>John 8:44</b></cite>

              <b>Note:</b> Satan himself will appear as an angel of light and claim to be Christ. He could also claim to have changed the Sabbath to Sunday and urge the world to move forward with honoring his counterfeit Sunday. The Bible says the deception will be effective and many will be deceived (<a>Revelation 13:3</a>), except God’s true followers who put everything to the test of Scripture (<a>Isaiah 8:19, 20; 2 Timothy 2:15</a>). The Bible clearly says God’s law cannot change (<a>Luke 16:17; 21:33</a>), and Jesus will not touch the earth at His second coming but remain in the clouds to meet His people in the air (<a>1 Thessalonians 4:16, 17</a>).

            <h2>Will there be a genuine revival too?</h2>
            <p>
              And I saw another angel fly in the midst of heaven, <em>having the everlasting gospel to preach unto them that dwell on the earth, and to every nation, and kindred, and tongue, and people</em>, saying with a loud voice, <em>Fear God, and give glory to him; for the hour of his judgment is come: and worship him that made heaven, and earth, and the sea, and the fountains of waters</em>.
              <br><br>
              And there followed another angel, saying, <em>Babylon is fallen, is fallen</em>, that great city, because she made all nations drink of the wine of the wrath of her fornication.
              <br><br>
              And the third angel followed them, saying with a loud voice, <em>If any man worship the beast and his image, and receive his mark in his forehead, or in his hand, the same shall drink of the wine of the wrath of God, which is poured out without mixture into the cup of his indignation</em>; and he shall be tormented with fire and brimstone in the presence of the holy angels, and in the presence of the Lamb: and the smoke of their torment ascendeth up for ever and ever: and they have no rest day nor night, who worship the beast and his image, and whosoever receiveth the mark of his name. Here is the patience of the saints: here are they that keep the commandments of God, and the faith of Jesus. <cite><b>Revelation 14:6-12</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> As Satan is working to deceive the world into believing that they must compromise with error by casting aside God’s Sabbath to keep a counterfeit day He never appointed, God will have a people who will give a powerful, three-point message to the entire world, symbolized by the three angels of Revelation 14, to unmask the deceptions of Satan so that every person alive will be well-informed regarding God’s Sabbath, and warned against receiving the beast’s mark, the counterfeit Sunday, because this decision will have eternal consequences.
              <br><br>
              Those who choose to obey and worship the beast through his man-made “holy” day will receive his mark and will cut themselves off from God’s love and mercy, and by extension, shut themselves out of His eternal kingdom. There will also be those who will join God’s side and choose to worship Him on His holy day, and Jesus’ sacrifice on the cross will cover their sins through faith and transform them into His obedient followers, sealing them for eternity (<a>Revelation 7:2, 3</a>).

            <h2>Who is the false prophet of Revelation 16:13?</h2>
            <p>
              And I saw three unclean spirits like frogs come out of the mouth of the dragon, and out of the mouth of the beast, and <em>out of the mouth of the false prophet</em>. <cite><b>Revelation 16:13</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              And the beast was taken, and <em>with him the false prophet that wrought miracles before him, with which he deceived them that had received the mark of the beast</em>, and them that worshipped his image. These both were cast alive into a lake of fire burning with brimstone. <cite><b>Revelation 19:20</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> The false prophet works miracles before the beast to deceive those who end up receiving the beast’s mark and worshiping his image. This is a clear reference to the lamb-like beast of <a>Revelation 13:11-18</a> who appears spiritual and trustworthy, but ends up in an alliance with the papacy to persecute those who refuse to join the Sunday-keeping movement. The false prophet, therefore, represents Protestant America or, more specifically, apostate Protestantism, which also joins the Sunday-keeping alliance with the papacy. But their work of persecution will be interrupted by the second coming of Christ, who comes as a victorious King to rescue His persecuted followers (<a>Revelation 19:11-16</a>)!

            <h2>Is this the battle of Armageddon?</h2>
            <p>
              And the sixth angel poured out his vial upon the great river Euphrates; and the <em>water thereof was dried up, that the way of the kings of the east might be prepared</em>. And I saw three unclean spirits like frogs come out of the mouth of the dragon, and out of the mouth of the beast, and out of the mouth of the false prophet. For they are the spirits of devils, working miracles, <em>which go forth unto the kings of the earth and of the whole world, to gather them to the battle of that great day of God Almighty</em>. Behold, I come as a thief. Blessed is he that watcheth, and keepeth his garments, lest he walk naked, and they see his shame. And <em>he gathered them together into a place called in the Hebrew tongue Armageddon</em>. <cite><b>Revelation 16:12-16</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              And I saw the beast, and the kings of the earth, and their armies, <em>gathered together to make war against him that sat on the horse, and against his army</em>. <cite><b>Revelation 19:19</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              <em>These have one mind, and shall give their power and strength unto the beast. These shall make war with the Lamb, and the Lamb shall overcome them</em>: for he is Lord of lords, and King of kings: and they that are with him are called, and chosen, and faithful. <cite><b>Revelation 17:12-14</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> The battle of Armageddon is the final battle that’s fought on earth between Christ and Satan. It’s mentioned in the context of the beast and the false prophet, meaning it will be initiated by them, involving all the nations of the world in a united fight against Jesus and His people, with the goal of destroying all who refuse to worship the beast. But God will intervene.
              <br><br>
              The symbolic Euphrates river will dry up, meaning popular support of the beast will disappear (<a>Revelation 17:15</a>), prior to the coming of the “kings from the east,” which are the Father and His Son Jesus, a reference to the second coming (<a>Revelation 7:2; Ezekiel 43:2; Matthew 24:27</a>), when the people of God will be saved (<a>Revelation 16:17-21; 19:11-20</a>)! The battle will resume after the 1,000 years, when Satan and his followers surround the New Jerusalem and try to capture it, but they will be destroyed by fire from heaven (<a>Revelation 20:9</a>; see “1,000 Years of Peace”), bringing the battle, and the great controversy between good and evil, to an end!

              He that dwelleth in the secret place of the most High shall abide under the shadow of the Almighty.

He shall cover thee with his feathers, and under his wings shalt thou trust: <em>his truth shall be thy shield and buckler</em>. Thou shalt not be afraid for the terror by night; nor for the arrow that flieth by day; nor for the pestilence that walketh in darkness; nor for the destruction that wasteth at noonday. A thousand shall fall at thy side, and ten thousand at thy right hand; but it shall not come nigh thee. Only with thine eyes shalt thou behold and see the reward of the wicked.

They shall bear thee up in their hands, lest thou dash thy foot against a stone. Thou shalt tread upon the lion and adder: the young lion and the dragon shalt thou trample under feet. Because he hath set his love upon me, therefore will I deliver him: I will set him on high, because he hath known my name. <em>He shall call upon me, and I will answer him: I will be with him in trouble; I will deliver him</em>, and honour him.

            <h2>What is the origin of Babylon?</h2>
            <p>
              And they said, Go to, let us build us a city and a tower, whose top may reach unto heaven; and let us make us a name, lest we be scattered abroad upon the face of the whole earth. And the LORD came down to see the city and the tower, which the children of men builded. And the LORD said, Behold, the people is one, and they have all one language; and this they begin to do: and now nothing will be restrained from them, which they have imagined to do. Go to, let us go down, and there confound their language, that they may not understand one another's speech. So the LORD scattered them abroad from thence upon the face of all the earth: and they left off to build the city. <em>Therefore is the name of it called Babel; because the LORD did there confound the language of all the earth</em>: and from thence did the LORD scatter them abroad upon the face of all the earth. <cite><b>Genesis 11:4-9</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              The king spake, and said, <em>Is not this great Babylon, that I have built</em> for the house of the kingdom <em>by the might of my power, and for the honour of my majesty</em>? <cite><b>Daniel 4:30</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> The word “Babylon” originated at the Tower of Babel because it was the place where God confounded language, leading to confusion and bringing construction to a halt. “Babylon” and “Babel” both mean “confusion.” Later on in the 600s BC, the pagan kingdom of Babylon arose (see “Europe’s Future Revealed”) and developed into an economic and religious center of the world. Its religion was characterized by idolatry, ancestor worship, and sun worship, and it became an enemy of God’s people, Israel (<a>Jeremiah 39:6, 7; 50:29-34; 51:34</a>). Babylon was also marked by a boastful and prideful spirit, as seen in the Babylonian king’s boastful remark in <a>Daniel 4:30</a>. In fact, in <a>Isaiah 14:4-22</a>, God uses Babylon as a symbol of Satan due to its pride and wickedness.

            <h2>What kind of legacy did ancient Babylon leave behind?</h2>
            <p>
              Babylon hath been a golden cup in the LORD's hand, that made all the earth drunken: <em>the nations have drunken of her wine; therefore the nations are mad</em>. Babylon is suddenly fallen and destroyed: howl for her; take balm for her pain, if so be she may be healed. <cite><b>Jeremiah 51:7, 8</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              Then they <em>brought the golden vessels that were taken out of the temple of the house of God which was at Jerusalem; and the king, and his princes, his wives, and his concubines, drank in them</em>. They drank wine, and praised the gods of gold, and of silver, of brass, of iron, of wood, and of stone. <cite><b>Daniel 5:3, 4</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> Because of its power and influence in the world, Babylon made drunk, or confused, the nations of the world with its false pagan teachings, and due to its refusal to turn from its wickedness, idolatry, and persecution of God’s people, God allowed it to be destroyed (<a>Daniel 4:30; Jeremiah 51:24, 47</a>) by the Medo-Persians. On the night of its fall, the king of Babylon threw a party, during which he desecrated the holy vessels stolen from the temple of God in Jerusalem by drinking wine out of them and using them for the unholy worship of false gods. He ended up perishing that very night (<a>Daniel 5:30</a>). The Bible makes it clear in <a>Isaiah 13:19, 20</a> that ancient Babylon would never be rebuilt or inhabited again, so the Babylon of the book of Revelation is not a literal Babylon, but a spiritual one.

            <p>
              And there came one of the seven angels which had the seven vials, and talked with me, saying unto me, Come hither; I will shew unto thee the judgment of the great whore that <em>sitteth upon many waters</em>: With whom the kings of the earth have committed fornication, and the inhabitants of the earth have been made drunk with the wine of her fornication. So he carried me away in the spirit into the wilderness: and I saw a woman <em>sit upon a scarlet coloured beast, full of names of blasphemy, having seven heads and ten horns</em>. And the woman was <em>arrayed in purple and scarlet colour, and decked with gold and precious stones and pearls, having a golden cup in her hand full of abominations</em> and filthiness of her fornication: And upon her forehead was a name written, MYSTERY, BABYLON THE GREAT, <em>THE MOTHER OF HARLOTS</em> AND ABOMINATIONS OF THE EARTH. And I saw the woman <em>drunken with the blood of the saints, and with the blood of the martyrs of Jesus</em>: and when I saw her, I wondered with great admiration. <cite><b>Revelation 17:1-6</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              And the woman which thou sawest is that great city, which <em>reigneth over the kings of the earth</em>. <cite><b>Revelation 17:18</b></cite>

              And I have put my words in thy mouth, and I have covered thee in the shadow of mine hand, that I may plant the heavens, and lay the foundations of the earth, and say unto <em>Zion, Thou art my people</em>. <cite><b>Isaiah 51:16</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              For this cause shall a man leave his father and mother, and shall be <em>joined unto his wife</em>, and they two shall be one flesh. This is a great mystery: but I speak concerning Christ and <em>the church</em>. Nevertheless let every one of you in particular so love his wife even as himself; and the wife see that she reverence her husband. <cite><b>Ephesians 5:31-33</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              Let us be glad and rejoice, and give honour to him: for the marriage of the Lamb is come, and <em>his wife hath made herself ready</em>. And to her was granted that she should be arrayed in fine linen, clean and white: for the fine linen is the righteousness of saints. <cite><b>Revelation 19:7, 8</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              Son of man, <em>cause Jerusalem to know her abominations</em> ... But thou didst trust in thine own beauty, and <em>playedst the harlot</em> because of thy renown, and pouredst out thy fornications on every one that passed by; his it was. <cite><b>Ezekiel 16:2, 15</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> In the Bible a woman represents the church. A pure woman is a pure church that is faithful to Jesus, while an impure woman, or a harlot, is an unfaithful, or fallen, church. In <a>Revelation 19:7, 8</a> the true church is portrayed as Christ’s bride, and her members are covered by and reflect the righteousness of Jesus.

            <h2>Who does the harlot represent?</h2>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> The Bible gives seven characteristics to identify the harlot of Revelation 17 as the papacy. Now it’s important to emphasize that this is not a condemnation of Roman Catholics; rather, the Bible is pointing out a system&mdash;Catholicism. In other places the Bible also points out the faults of the Jewish and Protestant faiths. Moreover, God has devoted Christians in all churches, including the Roman Catholic church. It is also true that the papacy has done many good deeds for the poor and the needy, but she has also committed serious errors that the Bible clearly points out in Daniel and in Revelation. God must sometimes chasten and rebuke because He wants us to be aware of error and compromise, and people who are truly loyal to Him will heed His warnings, no matter the faith. With this in mind, let’s examine each of the seven characteristics.
              <br><br>
              <em>a) She is called the “Mother of Harlots.”</em> There is only one church that calls itself the mother church&mdash;the Roman Catholic Church. A prominent Catholic priest has made the following point: “They [non-Catholics] have continued the custom [of Sunday-keeping], even though it rests upon the authority of the Catholic Church and not upon an explicit text in the Bible. That observance [Sunday-keeping] remains as a reminder of the Mother Church from which the non-Catholic sects broke away&mdash;like a boy running away from home but still carrying in his pocket a picture of his mother or a lock of her hair.”<sup>1</sup>
              <br><br>
              <em>b) She persecutes the saints.</em> The papacy persecuted and killed millions of people during the Dark Ages for following their conscience.
              <br><br>
              <em>c) She is dressed in purple and scarlet and decked with jewelry.</em> The colors listed match those of papal vestments. Red is the robe color worn by Catholic cardinals, and purple is the color of royalty, often worn by the pope at significant events since he is considered to be Christ’s representative on earth. <a>Revelation 18:7</a> confirms this when it says that Babylon considers herself a queen. She is also decked with gold, precious stones, and pearls, all of which point to great wealth, which can be seen in her ornate and extravagant cathedrals. The golden cup in her hand looks impressive on the outside, but the inside is full of abominations&mdash;or false teachings based on human tradition, which is elevated above the Bible.
              <br><br>
              <em>d) She is sitting on a beast.</em> A beast represents a kingdom or nation (<a>Daniel 7:23</a>), so the fact that she is sitting on the beast represents not just the union of church and state (though they remain separate entities), but power over the state and its policies. This was fulfilled in the Dark Ages when the papacy united with, and exercised power over, the state to implement her policies and persecute people who disagreed with her teachings. This will be repeated again in the last days (see “USA in Bible Prophecy”).
              <br><br>
              <em>e) She has worldwide influence.</em> Her influence is not limited to just one civil government. Her sitting on many waters (<a>Revelation 17:1, 15</a>), which represent people and nations, shows her influence and power over them, and <a>Revelation 17:18</a> confirms this again by saying that she reigns “over the kings of the earth.” The papacy fulfills this point too. According to historian Alexander Flick, by the 13th century the pope was “at least in theory ... the ruler of the whole world in temporal and spiritual affairs.”<sup>2</sup>
              <br><br>
              <em>f) The beast she’s sitting on has seven heads and ten horns.</em> The seven heads are seven mountains (<a>Revelation 17:9</a>), and Rome, the headquarters of the papacy, is known, and has been referred to by classical writers, as the City of Seven Hills. The ten horns represent the ten barbarian tribes that arose after the fall of the Roman Empire (see “Europe’s Future Revealed”).
              <br><br>
              <em>g) The beast is guilty of blasphemy.</em> Blasphemy has two definitions in the Bible: claiming to forgive sins (<a>Luke 5:21</a>), and claiming to be God (<a>John 10:33</a>). The papacy is a continuation of the pagan Roman Empire, and just like the Roman emperors claimed to be gods, the popes claim to be Christ (see question 10 of “Who Is the Antichrist?”).
              <br><br>
              There is no other earthly power that fulfills all of these characteristics. Many leaders of the Reformation, including Huss, Wycliffe, Luther, Calvin, Zwingli, Melanchthon, Cranmer, Tyndale, Latimer, and Ridley, also agreed that the power described here is the papacy.<sup>3</sup>

            <h2>Who are the harlot daughters?</h2>
            <p>
              And upon her forehead was a name written, MYSTERY, BABYLON THE GREAT, <em>THE MOTHER OF HARLOTS</em> AND ABOMINATIONS OF THE EARTH. <cite><b>Revelation 17:5</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              Ye therefore, beloved, seeing ye know these things before, beware lest ye also, <em>being led away with the error of the wicked, fall from your own stedfastness</em>. But grow in grace, and in the knowledge of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ. To him be glory both now and for ever. <cite><b>2 Peter 3:17, 18</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              Jesus saith unto him, <em>I am the way, the truth, and the life</em>: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me. <cite><b>John 14:6</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> Just as the harlot represents a fallen church, her daughters also represent fallen churches. Since the mother, just like ancient Babylon, has confused the world with her teachings, these daughter churches follow and teach the same key errors as the mother church. No woman, however, is born a harlot. These harlot daughters were originally undefiled and separate from the mother when during the great Protestant Reformation they protested her unbiblical teachings, but slowly, over time, they began to come back to her in acknowledgment of her authority and in agreement with her key teachings. This has led to them becoming fallen themselves and a part of spiritual Babylon. Peter uses the word “fallen” as another term to describe a turning away from truth and choosing to be led by error instead. He contrasts this with growing in grace and the knowledge of Jesus, which means that, ultimately, a fallen church turns her back on Jesus Himself because He is the truth.

            <h2>What is Babylon guilty of?</h2>
            <p>
              <em>With whom the kings of the earth have committed fornication, and the inhabitants of the earth have been made drunk</em> with the wine of her fornication. <cite><b>Revelation 17:2</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              <em>Ye adulterers and adulteresses, know ye not that the friendship of the world is enmity with God</em>? whosoever therefore will be a friend of the world is the enemy of God. <cite><b>James 4:4</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b>  James describes spiritual adultery as a union with the world, and Revelation clearly shows that spiritual Babylon develops partnerships with earthly kings and uses the ways of the world (coercion) to win people to her side. We’ve already seen how the papacy united with the state in the Dark Ages to persecute, torture, and kill millions of people. God prohibits such a union because He never uses coercive measures to draw people to Himself; instead, He respectfully knocks at the door of the heart (<a>Revelation 3:20</a>) because He respects freedom of choice and wants people to follow Him out of love. He does not need the state to help bring people into His church; His love alone is powerful enough! The true church is loyal to Jesus only, but the papacy has turned away from her husband, Jesus, and formed illicit relationships with the state instead.

            <h2>What does this union lead to?</h2>
            <p>
              And an host was given him against the daily sacrifice by reason of transgression, and <em>it cast down the truth to the ground; and it practised, and prospered</em>. <cite><b>Daniel 8:12</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              And the woman was arrayed in purple and scarlet colour, and <em>decked with gold and precious stones and pearls, having a golden cup</em> in her hand full of abominations and filthiness of her fornication. <cite><b>Revelation 17:4</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              For all nations have drunk of the wine of the wrath of her fornication, and the kings of the earth have committed fornication with her, and the <em>merchants of the earth are waxed rich through the abundance of her delicacies</em>. ... And they cast dust on their heads, and cried, weeping and wailing, saying, Alas, alas, that great city, <em>wherein were made rich all that had ships in the sea by reason of her costliness</em>! for in one hour is she made desolate. <cite><b>Revelation 18:3, 19</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> Whenever a church unites with the world, it results in a turning away from Bible truth. In <a>Daniel 8:9-12</a> the little horn of <a>Daniel 7:8</a>, representing the papacy (see “Who Is the Antichrist?”), is mentioned again, and the text says it casts truth to the ground and prospers. As the papacy replaced Bible truth with its own tradition and pagan teachings, it opened up the way to practices, like the selling of indulgences, that allowed it to acquire incredible wealth. In <a>Revelation 18:11-13</a> this is confirmed when she’s mentioned as trafficking in the “souls of men” or, in other words, treating people as merchandise. No wonder she is decked with all kinds of expensive jewelry and holds a golden cup in <a>Revelation 17:4</a>. The next chapter then talks about ships in the sea and merchants being made rich because of her&mdash;a reference to economic advantages that lead to prosperity through some form of a partnership or alliance with her. Could this apply to large, global corporations, for example?

            <h2>What other powers are part of Babylon?</h2>
            <p>
              And I saw <em>three unclean spirits</em> like frogs come out of the mouth of the <em>dragon</em>, and out of the mouth of the <em>beast</em>, and out of the mouth of the <em>false prophet</em>. For they are the spirits of devils, working miracles, which go forth unto the kings of the earth and of the whole world, to gather them to the battle of that great day of God Almighty. <cite><b>Revelation 16:13, 14</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              And after these things I saw another angel come down from heaven, having great power; and the earth was lightened with his glory. And he cried mightily with a strong voice, saying, <em>Babylon the great is fallen, is fallen, and is become the habitation of devils, and the hold of every foul spirit, and a cage of every unclean and hateful bird</em>. For all nations have drunk of the wine of the wrath of her fornication, and the kings of the earth have committed fornication with her, and the merchants of the earth are waxed rich through the abundance of her delicacies. <cite><b>Revelation 18:1-3</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> There are three powers that come together: the dragon, the beast, and the false prophet. <a>Revelation 12:9</a> tells us the dragon represents Satan working through pagan Rome when it tried to destroy Jesus at His birth (<a>Revelation 12:4</a>). Satan is also called the prince of this world in <a>John 12:31</a>, and his influence expands beyond pagan Rome. He has used ancient Egypt, Assyria, and Babylon to persecute God’s people, and we’ve learned he will use the U.S.A. and the papacy in the future. Because <a>Revelation 13:8</a> says all the world will worship the beast in the last days, other world governments will be used too, as well as non-Christian religions, such as Islam, Buddhism, Hinduism, the New Age, etc.
              <br><br>
              The second power, the beast, represents the papacy (see “Mark of the Beast”) and the false prophet represents the apostate Protestantism of America (see “USA in Bible Prophecy”). And so world governments and non-Christian religions, Roman Catholicism, and apostate Protestantism will form an alliance, called “Babylon the great” in <a>Revelation 18:2</a>, in the final battle against God, His followers, and His law. Note how the three powers of <a>Revelation 16:13</a> are associated with unclean spirits, and Babylon is said to be the “hold of every foul spirit” in <a>Revelation 18:2</a>.

            <h2>What will unite these powers?</h2>
            <p>
              And I saw <em>three unclean spirits</em> like frogs come out of the mouth of the dragon, and out of the mouth of the beast, and out of the mouth of the false prophet. For <em>they are the spirits of devils, working miracles</em>, which go forth unto the kings of the earth and of the whole world, to gather them to the battle of that great day of God Almighty. <cite><b>Revelation 16:13, 14</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              And the light of a candle shall shine no more at all in thee; and the voice of the bridegroom and of the bride shall be heard no more at all in thee: for thy merchants were the great men of the earth; for <em>by thy sorceries were all nations deceived</em>. <cite><b>Revelation 18:23</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              For there shall arise <em>false Christs, and false prophets, and shall shew great signs and wonders</em>; insomuch that, if it were possible, they shall deceive the very elect. <cite><b>Matthew 24:24</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              Now the Spirit speaketh expressly, that in the latter times some shall depart from the faith, <em>giving heed to seducing spirits, and doctrines of devils</em>; speaking lies in hypocrisy; having their conscience seared with a hot iron. <cite><b>1 Timothy 4:1, 2</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              For such are false apostles, deceitful workers, <em>transforming themselves into the apostles of Christ</em>. And no marvel; for <em>Satan himself is transformed into an angel of light</em>. <cite><b>2 Corinthians 11:13, 14</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> What the three powers of <a>Revelation 16:13</a> have in common are the unclean spirits that come out of their mouths, and according to <a>Revelation 16:14</a>, these are spirits of devils working through miracles and sorcery. This is an echo of Christ’s warning about false Christs and false prophets working miracles, which means we can expect a counterfeit religious revival, supported by miracles, sorcery, and spiritism, just before Christ’s coming. Spiritism, a doctrine of Satan first introduced in Eden when he told Eve she would “not surely die” (<a>Genesis 3:4</a>), is the belief that the dead are alive and can contact the living.
              <br><br>
              Incidentally, Catholicism prays to Mary and other dead saints; apostate Protestantism also believes the dead are not really dead but alive in heaven or hell; and non-Christian religions have a door open to spiritism through practices like “channeling” and spirit worship. And so when Satan and his angels pose as dead loves ones, prophets of old, angels of heaven, or even Christ Himself, while quoting a twisted version of the Scriptures, the deception will be overwhelming to anyone whose faith is not based on the Bible.

            <h2>What did ancient Babylon believe about death?</h2>
            <p>
              Then he brought me to the door of the gate of the LORD'S house which was toward the north; and, behold, <em>there sat women weeping for Tammuz</em>. <cite><b>Ezekiel 8:14</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> Tamuz was the god of food and vegetation worshiped by the Babylonians, who believed he died each year (immortality of the soul), and so his death was mourned. But it wasn’t just Tamuz; they also believed that people went on to exist in another form after death, which led the Babylonians to worship the dead. This teaching, that people continue to live or be conscious after death, has survived and been adopted by spiritual Babylon, and her influence has made it spread to many Christian churches even though the Bible preaches the exact opposite (<a>Ecclesiastes 9:5; Psalm 115:17</a>; see “Are the Dead Really Dead?”).

            <h2>What else did ancient Babylon believe?</h2>
            <p>
              Therefore, behold, the days come, that I will do judgment upon the <em>graven images of Babylon</em>: and her whole land shall be confounded, and all her slain shall fall in the midst of her. <cite><b>Jeremiah 51:47</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              And he brought me into the inner court of the LORD’S house, and, behold, at the door of the temple of the LORD, between the porch and the altar, were about five and twenty men, with their backs toward the temple of the LORD, and their faces toward the east; and <em>they worshipped the sun toward the east</em>. <cite><b>Ezekiel 8:16</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> The worship of graven images was also a practice of ancient Babylonians that has been adopted by spiritual Babylon even though God clearly forbids it in the second commandment (<a>Exodus 20:4-6</a>). Ancient Babylonians practiced sun worship too, and it managed to corrupt some of God’s very own people. The practice has been adopted by spiritual Babylon through the keeping of Sunday&mdash;the day of the sun&mdash;as the day of worship instead of the seventh-day Sabbath as outlined in the fourth commandment (<a>Exodus 20:8-11</a>). Many are unaware of the pagan origin of Sunday-keeping, which is why God has a message for the last days calling people to worship Him according to His commandments (see “Sabbath”). Incidentally, the false teaching that the law of God has been changed or repealed is also propogated by spiritual Babylon even though the Bible clearly teaches the law cannot be changed (<a>Luke 16:17</a>; see “Change in God’s Law”).
              <br><br>
              One other particularly destructive pagan teaching that has caused many people to turn away from God is the belief that sinners burn eternally in hell&mdash;an echo of Satan’s original “you shall not surely die” lie in Eden and a contradiction of God’s word (<a>Genesis 2:17; 3:4</a>; see “Is Hell Forever?”).

            <h2>What is God’s message to people in Babylon?</h2>
            <p>
              <em>Flee out of the midst of Babylon</em>, and deliver every man his soul: be not cut off in her iniquity; for this is the time of the LORD'S vengeance; he will render unto her a recompence. <cite><b>Jeremiah 51:6</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              And after these things I saw another angel come down from heaven, having great power; and the earth was lightened with his glory. And he cried mightily with a strong voice, saying, Babylon the great is fallen, is fallen, and is become the habitation of devils, and the hold of every foul spirit, and a cage of every unclean and hateful bird. For all nations have drunk of the wine of the wrath of her fornication, and the kings of the earth have committed fornication with her, and the merchants of the earth are waxed rich through the abundance of her delicacies. And I heard another voice from heaven, saying, <em>Come out of her, my people, that ye be not partakers of her sins, and that ye receive not of her plagues</em>. For her sins have reached unto heaven, and God hath remembered her iniquities. <cite><b>Revelation 18:1-5</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              And other sheep I have, <em>which are not of this fold</em>: them also I must bring, and <em>they shall hear my voice</em>; and there shall be one fold, and one shepherd. <cite><b>John 10:16</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> The false teachings previously mentioned are some of the key doctrines, the wine, through which spiritual Babylon makes all nations of the world drunk (<a>Revelation 17:2; 18:3</a>). This wine disorients, confuses, and leads to spiritual drunkenness. And it’s based on lies, which are a type of abomination in the Bible (<a>Proverbs 12:22</a>). Just like God called Israel out of ancient Babylon, He is calling His people out of spiritual Babylon before it’s destroyed because He knows He has sincere Christians there who have not heard this warning yet. When they hear His call, Jesus says they will heed His voice and follow Him.

            <p>
              But he answered and said, <em>It is written</em>, Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God. ... Jesus said unto him, <em>It is written again</em>, Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God. ... Then saith Jesus unto him, Get thee hence, Satan: <em>for it is written</em>, Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and him only shalt thou serve. <cite><b>Matthew 4:4, 7, 10</b></cite>

            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> Jesus’ answer to every deception Satan threw at Him was to quote the Bible. (Note that Satan quoted the Bible too, but he twisted it for his own purposes.) Studying and memorizing Scripture is the only effective strategy to resist Satan’s deceptions in these last days, because he will twist the Bible again. After all, his persuasive logic managed to deceieve a third of the angels in heaven (<a>Revelation 12:4</a>) and almost the entire population (minus eight people) at the time of the Flood.

            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> In the Bible, angels symbolize messengers or messages. Because God wants everyone to come to the knowledge of the truth so that they can be saved (<a>1 Timothy 2:3, 4</a>), He will have a remnant people, portrayed in the three angels’ messages of <a>Revelation 14:6-14</a>, who will stand for Bible truth and expose the false gospel of Babylon (<a>Galatians 1:8-12</a>), calling people to worship and obey Him, not only in spirit but also in truth. God’s message of truth will be so powerful that it will illuminate the whole world with His glory, so that every person, instead of being deceived, will be well-informed when making a decision regarding who to worship.

              And I heard another voice from heaven, saying, Come out of her, my people, <em>that ye be not partakers of her sins, and that ye receive not of her plagues</em>. ... Therefore shall her plagues come in one day, death, and mourning, and famine; and <em>she shall be utterly burned with fire</em>: for strong is the Lord God who judgeth her. <cite><b>Revelation 18:4, 8</b></cite>

            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> Babylon has become hopelessly drunk with her false doctrines and traditions, which have resulted in her sinning against God (breaking His law), and Jesus says she’s going to be destroyed, not reformed. There may be pressure from other people to stay in Babylon, but remaining in a system that teaches errors is spiritually dangerous; ultimately, it’s Jesus’ opinion that matters most. When Paul was under immense pressure from religious leaders to compromise with error, He answered, “We ought to obey God rather than men” (<a>Acts 5:29</a>). Though it may seem difficult, it’s the right thing to do. If this is you, ask God for guidance as you seek His will and search the Scriptures (<a>Acts 17:11</a>). Promise Him that you will follow wherever He leads, and His promise to you is He will lead you to the truth (<a>John 7:17</a>), which will set you free (<a>John 17:17</a>). When Jesus has your heart, He will give all the grace you need to follow Him (<a>Philippians 4:13</a>).

              <b>Note:</b> Jesus established His church upon Himself, the Rock. Paul makes it clear that Jesus is also the foundation, as well as the head of the church. Moreover, He is the only Mediator between God and man (<a>1 Timothy 2:5</a>). The word used for Peter in <a>Matthew 16:18</a> is “Petros,” which refers to a detached stone that can be moved around. Peter was a mere man who later ended up denying Christ (<a>Matthew 26:69-75</a>), so he could not be the foundation of the church. The word for "Rock" in <a>Matthew 16:18</a> is “petra,” which refers to an immovable mass of rock&mdash;a solid foundation&mdash;Jesus Christ Himself.

              Praising God, and having favour with all the people. And the <em>Lord added to the church daily</em> such as should be saved. <cite><b>Acts 2:47</b></cite>

            <p>
              Then <em>had the churches rest</em> throughout all Judaea and Galilee and Samaria, and were edified; and walking in the fear of the Lord, and in the comfort of the Holy Ghost, were multiplied. <cite><b>Acts 9:31</b></cite>

              <em>Not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together</em>, as the manner of some is; but exhorting one another: and so much the more, as ye see the day approaching. <cite><b>Hebrews 10:25</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> After Jesus ascended to heaven, the church He established multiplied as it shared the truths it received from Christ with the world. Though it did not have an official denominational name, it was described as the body of Christ (<a>Colossians 1:18</a>). It was organized and included deacons, elders, and missionaries (<a>1 Timothy 3:8-13; Titus 1:5-9; Acts 13:4, 5</a>). Paul encouraged believers to attend church&mdash;a practice that’s in harmony with the example set by Jesus Himself, who faithfully attended church every Sabbath (<a>Luke 4:16</a>). Attending church offers opportunities to encourage others, brings the blessings of community, enables the gospel to be shared more effectively, and enhances one’s own spiritual journey.

              <b>Note:</b> God’s church was characterized by a commitment to the truth taught by Jesus, not manmade traditions, customs, or doctrines. But Paul also warned about apostasy coming in that would lead to a falling away from the church Jesus established (<a>2 Thessalonians 2:3</a>), which occured roughly 300 years after the establishment of Christianity when pagan customs and teachings started to make inroads.

            <p>
              And there appeared a great wonder in heaven; a woman <em>clothed with the sun, and the moon under her feet, and upon her head a crown of twelve stars</em>. <cite><b>Revelation 12:1</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> We learned in the previous lesson that a woman represents a church. A harlot represents an apostate church, while a pure woman represents God’s true church&mdash;the bride of Christ (<a>Revelation 19:7, 8; 2 Corinthians 11:2</a>). In <a>Revelation 12:1</a> we see a woman in stark contrast to the harlot of Revelation 17. She is clothed with the sun, which symbolizes Jesus and His righteousness (<a>Psalm 84:11; Malachi 4:2</a>), without which there is no salvation (<a>Acts 4:12</a>). This imagery illustrates Jesus’ desire for the church to radiate His glory to the world. The woman also has a moon under her feet, which has no light of its own, but reflects the light of the sun. This represents the sacrificial system of the Old Testament, which reflected the light of the Messiah to come (<a>Hebrews 10:1</a>). Her crown of 12 stars represents the work of the 12 disciples that crowned, or laid the foundation of, the New Testament church.

              And she <em>being with child cried</em>, travailing in birth, and pained to be delivered. And there appeared another wonder in heaven; and behold a great red dragon, having seven heads and ten horns, and seven crowns upon his heads. And his tail drew the third part of the stars of heaven, and did cast them to the earth: and the <em>dragon stood before the woman which was ready to be delivered, for to devour her child as soon as it was born</em>. And she brought forth a man child, who was to rule all nations with a rod of iron: and <em>her child was caught up unto God</em>, and to his throne.  <cite><b>Revelation 12:2-5</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> The woman is about to deliver a baby, representing Jesus, who would one day rule all nations with a rod of iron&mdash;a reference to <a>Revelation 2:27</a> and <a>Revelation 19:13-15</a>, which points to Jesus coming to the defense of His people when He returns the second time. There’s a red dragon who tries to devour the baby as soon as it’s born, but it escapes and is caught up to God’s throne&mdash;a reference to Jesus’ ascension to heaven. The dragon represents Satan, working through pagan Rome, trying to kill Jesus at His birth through Herod’s decree to kill all the babies of Bethlehem (<a>Matthew 2:16</a>).

            <h2>What do the seven heads and ten horns represent?</h2>
            <p>
               And here is the mind which hath wisdom. The <em>seven heads are seven mountains</em>, on which the woman sitteth. <cite><b>Revelation 17:9</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              And the <em>ten horns out of this kingdom are ten kings</em> that shall arise: and another shall rise after them; and he shall be diverse from the first, and he shall subdue three kings. <cite><b>Daniel 7:24</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> The dragon’s seven heads represent the seven hills of Rome, while the ten horns represent the 10 barbarian tribes that arose after the fall of the Roman Empire (<a>Daniel 7:23, 24</a>) and eventually became the nations of modern Europe. Ultimately, the dragon represents Satan&mdash;working not just through pagan Rome, but the 10 nations that arose out of it&mdash;persecuting God’s people. It refers to the time Christians were persecuted by the Roman Empire after Christ’s ascension as well as the European nations cooperating with the papacy’s persecution during the Dark Ages. In the last days, the ten horns represent all the nations of the world aligning with spiritual Babylon in its fight against God’s followers (<a>Revelation 16:14; 17:12, 13</a>; see “Fall of Spiritual Babylon”).
              <br><br>
              The reference to a third of the stars of heaven being cast down to earth points to the angels who supported Lucifer during his rebellion against God being cast out of heaven (<a>Revelation 12:9; Luke 10:18; Isaiah 14:12</a>; see “Origin of Evil”).

            <h2>What happens next?</h2>
            <p>
               And when the dragon saw that he was cast unto the earth, <em>he persecuted the woman which brought forth the man child</em>. And to the woman were given two wings of a great eagle, that she might <em>fly into the wilderness</em>, into her place, where she is nourished for a time, and times, and half a time, from the face of the serpent. <cite><b>Revelation 12:13</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              And the woman <em>fled into the wilderness</em>, where she hath a place prepared of God, that they should feed her there a thousand two hundred and threescore days. <cite><b>Revelation 12:6</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> Once Satan was no longer able to attack Jesus personally, he shifted his focus to persecuting God’s church. He first used the Roman Empire to persecute her, but later he switched to apostasy, which led to a split (falling away). He then started working through the apostate church to resume his persecution against the faithful church, but she was given wings, representing God’s protection (<a>Exodus 19:4; Deuteronomy 32:11</a>), so she could escape into the wilderness where she could preserve and live out God’s truths for “a time and times and half a time,” which is three and a half prophetic years or 1,260 literal years (see question 10 of see “Who is the Antichrist?”).
              <br><br>
              Satan began working through papal Rome at this time. (Note that the time spent in the wilderness matches the 1,260 year period of papal dominance&mdash;538 to 1798.) The wilderness refers to solitary places (mountains, caves, forests, deserts, etc.) where God’s church could hide to escape being totally destroyed (<a>Hebrews 11:37, 38</a>). The history and persecution of the Waldenses, Albigenses, and Huguenots, among many others, testifies to this reality. Millions died for their faith at the hands of the papacy, but God did not allow His church to be totally obliterated because the truth had to be preserved. God ensured that the doctrines of the apostolic church, which had entered this period of hiding, were preserved when the persecuted church came out of hiding.

            <h2>What does God call His end-time church?</h2>
            <p>
              And the dragon was wroth with the woman, and went to make war with the <em>remnant of her seed</em>, which <em>keep the commandments of God, and have the testimony of Jesus Christ</em>. <cite><b>Revelation 12:17</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              Here is the patience of the saints: here are they that <em>keep the commandments of God, and the faith of Jesus</em>. <cite><b>Revelation 14:12</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> The word “remnant” refers to the last remaining portion of something, so in reference to God’s church, it points to His church in the last days. This church is then given two characteristics: she keeps the commandments of God, including the seventh-day Sabbath of the fourth commandment (<a>John 14:15; Revelation 22:14</a>), and has the testimony of Jesus, which is the spirit of prophecy (<a>Revelation 19:10</a>). <a>Revelation 12:17</a> is an echo of <a>Revelation 14:12</a>, so the “testimony of Jesus Christ” can also refer to the faith and teachings of Jesus. Just as the remnant of a cloth has the same color and pattern as the original, the remnant church will return to the truths taught by Christ and believed by the original Christian church He established.
              <br><br>
              Furthermore, in the previous question we learned that God’s church went into hiding from the year 538 to 1798, so even though the church was still alive, it did not exist as an official organization during that time. In other words, God’s last day, remnant church had to arise after 1798, but the process started during the great Protestant Reformation, which led to the Bible being translated into the common language so it could be read by all. Once that happened, the light of the gospel began to shine, and it would not be stopped&mdash;“the gates of hell shall not prevail against it” (<a>Matthew 16:18</a>).

            <h2>Is there anything else about the remnant church?</h2>
            <p>
              And I saw another angel fly in the midst of heaven, <em>having the everlasting gospel to preach unto them that dwell on the earth</em>, and to every nation, and kindred, and tongue, and people, Saying with a loud voice, <em>Fear God, and give glory to him; for the hour of his judgment is come: and worship him that made</em> heaven, and earth, and the sea, and the fountains of waters. And there followed another angel, saying, <em>Babylon is fallen, is fallen, that great city, because she made all nations drink of the wine of the wrath of her fornication</em>.
              <br><br>
              And the third angel followed them, saying with a loud voice, <em>If any man worship the beast and his image, and receive his mark in his forehead, or in his hand, the same shall drink of the wine of the wrath of God</em>, which is poured out without mixture into the cup of his indignation; and he shall be tormented with fire and brimstone in the presence of the holy angels, and in the presence of the Lamb: and the smoke of their torment ascendeth up for ever and ever: and they have no rest day nor night, who worship the beast and his image, and whosoever receiveth the mark of his name. Here is the patience of the saints: here are they that keep the commandments of God, and the faith of Jesus. <cite><b>Revelation 14:6-12</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> The spirit of the Reformation continued through the centuries, leading to the establishment of God’s remnant that returned back to the teachings of the original church established by Jesus. This remnant church then preaches a three-point message, symbolized by the three angels of Revelation 14, that goes out to the entire world:
              <br><br>
              1) The first message calls people to fear God, which is an echo of <a>Ecclesiastes 12:13, 14</a> and a call to live a life of reverence for God that leads to keeping His commandments (see “God’s Law of Love”). It then calls people to give glory to Him, which is an echo of <a>1 Corinthians 10:31</a> and a call to live a life that glorifies Him in everything, including diet (see “God’s Health Plan”). The first message also announces that God’s judgment has already begun, and it calls people to worship Him as Creator (<a>Revelation 4:11</a>). This call to worship quotes the fourth commandment (<a>Exodus 20:8-11</a>), which identifies God as the Creator (<a>Genesis 2:1-3</a>) and invites people to worship Him as Creator by keeping His seventh-day Sabbath holy (see “Sabbath Keeping”).
              <br><br>
              2) The second message calls people to come out of the fallen churches of spiritual Babylon (see “Fall of Spiritual Babylon”).
              <br><br>
              3) The third message warns against worshiping the beast or receiving his mark, which is the observance of the papal Sunday in place of God’s true seventh-day Sabbath (see “Mark of the Beast”).
              <br><br>
              Because this three-point message goes to the entire world, the remnant church must be a worldwide missionary church that preaches this three-point message. With the addition of the previously identified clues, we now have the following list of characteristics regarding the remnant church:
              <br><br>
              A) It would arise after 1798. <br>
              B) It would believe all the teachings of Jesus. <br>
              C) It would have the spirit of prophecy. <br>
              D) It would keep the commandments of God, including His seventh-day Sabbath. <br>
              E) It would be a worldwide missionary church. <br>
              F) It would be preaching the three angels’ messages of Revelation 14.

            <h2>How many churches fit these characteristics?</h2>
            <p>
              <em>There is one body</em>, and one Spirit, even as ye are called in one hope of your calling; one Lord, one faith, one baptism; one God and Father of all, who is above all, and through all, and in you all. <cite><b>Ephesians 4:4-6</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              And other sheep I have, which are not of this fold: them also I must bring, and they shall hear my voice; and <em>there shall be one fold, and one shepherd</em>. <cite><b>John 10:16</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> The six characteristics above are specific enough that they fit only one church&mdash;the Seventh-day Adventist Church. Founded in 1863, it was born out of a desire to follow Jesus in accordance with the Bible alone; in this regard, it was a product and a continuation of the work of the Reformers. Being the only global organization preaching the three angels’ messages of Revelation 14, it’s committed to sharing the gospel of Jesus with the entire world.
              <br><br>
              Moreover, according to Paul, God has one body of believers, not a multitude of churches that often present contradictory messages leading to confusion. He has His people in other churches, no doubt, which is why He’s calling them out (<a>Revelation 18:4</a>; see “Fall of Spiritual Babylon”) and seeking to bring all of His followers together into His final church of the last days&mdash;into a unity that is based on the truths of His Word. The Greek word for “church” is “ekklesia,” and it literally means “called-out ones.” Just like there was only one way of escape in the time of Noah&mdash;the ark, Jesus has provided another kind of ark, the church, the pillar of truth (<a>1 Timothy 3:15</a>), to take His people safely through the closing moments of earth, and it’s absolutely crucial for every believer to be convinced, based on the Bible, that the church one attends meets the biblical criteria of God’s remnant church.

            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> The church is made of people, and people are not perfect. The church is more of a hospital for broken people whom Christ wants to heal and restore into His image. We are also called to be followers of Christ, not other Christians. Staying out of the church because of others was not what Jesus did. He faithfully attended church even though it was far from perfect, and despite the imperfect people there, Paul tells us that Jesus loves His church so much that He died for her (<a>Ephesians 5:25</a>). At the same time, Satan has not ceased his attack on God’s remnant church; he has just changed his tactics&mdash;from outright persecution in times past to a subtler strategy that is more inline with modern times, like discrediting her by spreading lies, but such actions are the very fulfillment of <a>Revelation 12:17</a>.

            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> The good news is that Jesus returns to a glorious church built on and in harmony with Bible truth, made up of faithful followers who refuse and separate from pagan teachings and traditions. They are known for their love of, loyalty to, and faith in Jesus, which is made evident in their obedience to His commandments.

Ever since, Jesus has always had a people, His church, who have believed the truth as it was taught by Him.

            <h2>What is the history of God’s church?</h2>
            <p>
              And I saw when the Lamb opened one of the seals, and I heard, as it were the noise of thunder, one of the four beasts saying, Come and see. And I saw, and behold <em>a white horse: and he that sat on him had a bow; and a crown was given unto him: and he went forth conquering, and to conquer</em>. And when he had opened the second seal, I heard the second beast say, Come and see. And there went out <em>another horse that was red: and power was given to him that sat thereon to take peace from the earth, and that they should kill one another: and there was given unto him a great sword</em>.
              <br><br>
              And when he had opened the third seal, I heard the third beast say, Come and see. And I beheld, and lo <em>a black horse; and he that sat on him had a pair of balances in his hand</em>. And I heard a voice in the midst of the four beasts say, A measure of wheat for a penny, and three measures of barley for a penny; and see thou hurt not the oil and the wine. And when he had opened the fourth seal, I heard the voice of the fourth beast say, Come and see. And I looked, and behold <em>a pale horse: and his name that sat on him was Death, and Hell followed with him. And power was given unto them over the fourth part of the earth, to kill with sword, and with hunger, and with death, and with the beasts of the earth</em>. <cite><b>Revelation 6:1-8</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> Revelation 6 outlines the history of God’s church with four symbolic horses. In <a>Zechariah 6:1-8</a> there is a similar vision with four chariots of two horses, and when Zechariah asks the angel what they represent he is told they are essentially messengers that go out. The number four, on the other hand, represents the four corners of the earth (<a>Revelation 7:1; Matthew 24:31</a>), so the four horses in Revelation 6 refer to the spread of the church, and more specifically, the phases that God’s church goes through as it spreads Jesus’ gospel message to the whole world.
              <br><br>
              The church began with the white horse, which is a symbol of purity (<a>Psalm 51:7; Isaiah 1:18</a>). This period began with the ascension of Jesus in A.D. 31 and lasted until the death of the last apostle in A.D. 100. The conquering of this horse refers to spiritual conquest, conquering falsehood with the arrows of truth (symbolized by the rider’s bow), and this the church did very well because after the Holy Spirit was poured out during Pentecost (<a>Acts 2:1-4</a>), the gospel message went out to the entire then-known world (<a>Colossians 1:23</a>).
              <br><br>
              The second horse is red, a symbol of blood (<a>2 Kings 3:22</a>), and in this context it represents persecution, which lasted from A.D. 100 to A.D. 313. The success of the apostolic church did not go unnoticed, so Satan used the Roman Empire to start persecuting God’s people (symbolized by the rider’s great sword); nevertheless, the church continued to grow during this time (<a>Romans 8:35-39</a>).
              <br><br>
              The third horse is black, and since it’s the opposite of white (purity), it represents corruption. This period lasted from A.D. 313 to A.D. 538. It was a time when Christianity was accepted by the state, which led to the introduction of various false, pagan doctrines and practices that ended up corrupting the church. The pair of scales in the rider’s hand represent judgment (<a>Daniel 5:24-28</a>).
              <br><br>
              The fourth and final horse is pale (near death), and the rider is called Death. This can only point to the period of the Dark Ages when Satan tried to extinguish the truths taught by Jesus and recorded in His Word (<a>Acts 20:28-30; 2 Thessalonians 2:1-10</a>). This phase spans from A.D. 538 to 1517&mdash;the start of the Reformation.

            <h2>What else does the Bible say about this last period?</h2>
            <p>
              And an host was given him against the daily sacrifice by reason of transgression, and <em>it cast down the truth to the ground; and it practised, and prospered</em>. <cite><b>Daniel 8:12</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              Let no man deceive you by any means: for that day shall not come, except there come <em>a falling away first</em>, and that man of sin be revealed, the son of perdition; <em>who opposeth and exalteth himself above all that is called God, or that is worshipped; so that he as God sitteth in the temple of God, shewing himself that he is God</em>. <cite><b>2 Thessalonians 2:3-7</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              Beloved, when I gave all diligence to write unto you of the common salvation, it was needful for me to write unto you, and exhort you that <em>ye should earnestly contend for the faith which was once delivered unto the saints</em>. For there are certain men crept in unawares, who were before of old ordained to this condemnation, ungodly men, turning the grace of our God into lasciviousness, and denying the only Lord God, and our Lord Jesus Christ. <cite><b>Jude 1:3, 4</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> Daniel predicted a time when truth would be cast down, and Paul wrote about a falling away that would occur before the second coming of Christ, marked by a religious system rising up that would oppose and exalt itself above God Himself (see “Who Is the Antichrist?”). This was also echoed by Jude, who encouraged his readers to contend earnestly for the unadulterated faith of the apostolic church. God used the Reformation movement to restore a lot of the truths that were cast to the ground, but this warfare against biblical truth has not ceased. The words of Paul and Jude are as relevant today as they were during the Dark Ages.

            <h2>What did Jesus warn about in the last days?</h2>
            <p>
              For there shall <em>arise false Christs, and false prophets</em>, and shall shew great signs and wonders<; insomuch that, if it were possible, they shall deceive the very elect. <cite><b>Matthew 24:24</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              <em>Put not your trust in princes</em>, nor in the son of man, in whom there is no help. <cite><b>Psalm 146:3</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              <em>Look unto me, and be ye saved</em>, all the ends of the earth: for I am God, and <em>there is none else</em>. <cite><b>Isaiah 45:22</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> Jesus warned about false prophets arising in the last days whose aim would be to deceive people, which brings us to the first identifying characteristic of a cult: it has one powerful human leader. This is dangerous because Jesus never taught His disciples to establish a hierarchy; on the contrary, He taught about humility and self-sacrifice in service to others (<a>Matthew 20:25-28</a>), and so the apostles saw themselves as fellow workers with others (<a>Philemon 1:24</a>). The Bible is very clear that we are not to put our trust in fallible human leaders, but to look to God, who alone can save us.

              Howbeit in vain do they worship me, <em>teaching for doctrines the commandments of men</em>. <cite><b>Mark 7:7</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> The second characteristic of a cult is the leader’s teachings cannot be questioned; they essentially become absolute truth even if they go against the teachings of the Bible, thus elevating them, and their leader, above the Bible. Jesus knew this would happen and clearly warned against it.

            <h2>What is the third identifier?</h2>
            <p>
              For do I now persuade men, or God? or <em>do I seek to please men?</em> for if I yet pleased men, I should not be the servant of Christ. <cite><b>Galatians 1:10</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              <em>You shall not follow the crowd in doing evil</em>, nor shall you testify in a dispute so as to join together with a crowd in order to pervert justice. <cite><b>Exodus 23:2, NASB</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> Cults will often pressure their members in order to coerce them into submission. This was the tactic the religious leaders used to coerce Pilate to crucify our Lord (<a>Matthew 27:24</a>) even though he was convinced Jesus was innocent. When there is a conflict between the demands of human beings and the will of Jesus as revealed in His Word, loyalty to Christ always takes precedence.

            <p>
              Beloved, when I gave all diligence to write unto you of the common salvation, it was needful for me to write unto you, and exhort you that ye should earnestly contend for the faith which was once delivered unto the saints. For there are certain men crept in unawares, who were before of old ordained to this condemnation, ungodly men, turning the grace of our God into lasciviousness, and <em>denying the only Lord God, and our Lord Jesus Christ</em>. <cite><b>Colossians 2:8, 9</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              Beware lest any man spoil you through philosophy and vain deceit, after the tradition of men, after the rudiments of the world, and not after Christ. <em>For in him dwelleth all the fulness of the Godhead bodily</em>. <cite><b>Colossians 2:8, 9</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> The fourth identifier of cults is their denial that Jesus is the divine Son of God&mdash;a central truth of the plan of salvation. The Bible plainly teaches that salvation is a gift from God (<a>Ephesians 2:8</a>) since God the Father gave His Son (<a>John 3:16</a>), and God the Son gave Himself, of His own free will (<a>John 10:17, 18</a>), on the cross for humanity. Incidentally, this denial of Christ’s divinity is almost a necessity as it opens the way for a human being to become the cult’s Messiah-like leader (see question 5).

              And the <em>woman which hath an husband that believeth not, and if he be pleased to dwell with her, let her not leave him</em>. For the unbelieving husband is sanctified by the wife, and the unbelieving wife is sanctified by the husband: else were your children unclean; but now are they holy. <cite><b>1 Corinthians 7:13, 14</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> Cults will often pressure their followers to leave their families because such separation makes it possible to have more control over their followers. The Bible does not teach this. Paul says that, if possible, a believing wife should not separate from an unbelieving husband. Jesus, too, after healing the demoniac, told him to go home to his friends to share what He had done for him even though the man wanted to follow Jesus (<a>Mark 5:18-20</a>). Instead of leaving his family and friends, Jesus wanted him to first reach them with the good news of the gospel!

            <h2>What counsel did Jesus give about the light of His truth?</h2>

              Then Jesus said unto them, Yet a little while is the light with you. <em>Walk while ye have the light, lest darkness come upon you</em>: for he that walketh in darkness knoweth not whither he goeth. <em>While ye have light, believe in the light, that ye may be the children of light</em>. <cite><b>John 12:35, 36</b></cite>

            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> The Bible is the great Light (<a>Psalm 119:105</a>), which we have the privilege of following while walking through life, and those who do this become the children of light. The Light prevents us from being deceived by lies that can only lead to darkness and bondage. Isaiah invites us to test every teaching with God’s Word. Is it in harmony with the Bible? If not, it is not from God.

              <b>Note:</b> God still had a people during the Dark Ages, like the Waldenses, Albigenses, and Huguenots, who faithfully preserved and followed the truth of His Word, which earned them only a life of relentless persecution, but this did not move them (<a>Acts 20:23, 24</a>) because they counted the truth of God’s Word more precious than life itself. When the Reformation began, the truth was unshackled and made even more accessible to the masses. Now with modern technologies like the radio, television, and the internet, the gospel is being, and will continue to be, preached all over the world until everyone has heard the good news of Jesus Christ’s love!

            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> The Holy Spirit is part of the Godhead, also referred to as the Trinity, that consists of three distinct Persons: the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. These three Persons are united in perfect harmony as one God (<a>Isaiah 46:9</a>). In the Old Testament there are multiple instances where this unity in plurality is shown (<a>Genesis 1:26; 3:22; 11:7; Isaiah 6:8</a>). Another example is Jesus’ baptism, when all three members of the Godhead were present: the Son of God was baptized, the Father spoke, and the Holy Spirit descended (<a>Matthew 3:16, 17</a>).

              But Peter said, Ananias, why hath Satan filled thine heart <em>to lie to the Holy Ghost</em>, and to keep back part of the price of the land? Whiles it remained, was it not thine own? and after it was sold, was it not in thine own power? why hast thou conceived this thing in thine heart? <em>thou hast not lied unto men, but unto God</em>. <cite><b>Acts 5:3, 4</b></cite>

            <p>
              Howbeit <em>when he, the Spirit</em> of truth, is come, he will guide you into all truth: for he shall not speak of himself; but whatsoever he shall hear, that shall he speak: and he will shew you things to come. <cite><b>John 16:13</b></cite>

            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> Peter made it clear that the Holy Spirit is not only God, but He can also be lied to, which means He’s a Person with a personality, not an impersonal “force.” Paul confirmed this when he stated that the Spirit has a mind. Jesus, also, referred to the Spirit as “He”&mdash;an individual Being who works in harmony with the Godhead.

              <b>Note:</b> Jesus promised that after His ascension He would send us the Comforter, the Holy Spirit, who’s abiding presence would comfort us. Notice also that when Jesus said the Holy Spirit would dwell in us, He followed that up with “I will come to you,” meaning Jesus equates the presence of the Spirit with His own presence! He Himself lives and abides in us through the Holy Spirit. When Jesus was on earth, people wanting to be with Him had to physically seek Him out, but we no longer have these limitations! Jesus can be anywhere and with anyone through the Person of the Holy Spirit.

            <h2>What is the Holy Spirit’s role?</h2>
            <p>
              Howbeit when he, the Spirit of truth, is come, <em>he will guide you into all truth</em>: for he shall not speak of himself; but whatsoever he shall hear, that shall he speak: and he will shew you things to come. He shall glorify me: for he shall receive of mine, and shall shew it unto you. <cite><b>John 16:13, 14</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              But the Comforter, which is the Holy Ghost, whom the Father will send in my name, <em>he shall teach you all things</em>, and bring all things to your remembrance, whatsoever I have said unto you. <cite><b>John 14:26</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              Now we have received, not the spirit of the world, but the spirit which is of God; <em>that we might know the things that are freely given to us of God</em>. Which things also we speak, not in the words which man's wisdom teacheth, but which the Holy Ghost teacheth; comparing spiritual things with spiritual. But <em>the natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God: for they are foolishness unto him: neither can he know them, because they are spiritually discerned</em>. <cite><b>1 Corinthians 2:12-14</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> Paul tells us that spiritual things are spiritually discerned (<a>1 Corinthians 2:14</a>), so one of the roles of the Holy Spirit is to teach and guide those studying the Bible into an understanding of its beautiful, freely given, truths because the Bible was written under the inspiration of the Spirit (<a>2 Timothy 3:16; 2 Peter 1:21</a>). Without the aid of the Spirit, the Bible cannot be understood, which is why it’s crucial to pray for the Holy Spirit’s guidance whenever we read it. Notice also that John says the Spirit does not speak independently of Jesus; on the contrary, He’s in harmony with the teachings of Jesus, working to give us an understanding of them.

            <h2>What else does the Holy Spirit do?</h2>
            <p>
              And when he is come, he will <em>reprove the world of sin, and of righteousness, and of judgment</em>. <cite><b>John 16:8</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              But when the Comforter is come, whom I will send unto you from the Father, even the Spirit of truth, which proceedeth from the Father, <em>he shall testify of me</em>. <cite><b>John 15:26</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              Likewise the Spirit also <em>helpeth our infirmities: for we know not what we should pray for as we ought: but the Spirit itself maketh intercession for us</em> with groanings which cannot be uttered. And he that searcheth the hearts knoweth what is the mind of the Spirit, because he maketh intercession for the saints according to the will of God. <cite><b>Romans 8:26, 27</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> The Holy Spirit reproves, or brings conviction, of sin, of righteousness, and of judgment. In other words, He identifies what is right and wrong in the sight of God, enabling us to experience spiritual growth and an increased love of God, His righteousness, and holy living. Put simply, the Holy Spirit is the catalyst that brings power, victory, and life to the Christian walk. These life changes might seem impossible to us, but, if we are willing to cooperate with the Holy Spirit, nothing is impossible to God (<a>Mark 10:26, 27; Philippians 2:13</a>).
              <br><br>
              The Holy Spirit also testifies of Jesus, revealing His character and truth to us, which, if received, has the power to sanctify our own characters (<a>John 14:6; 17:17</a>). And whenever we pray, it’s the Holy Spirit who inspires our petitions, if we let Him, so that they are in accordance to God’s will.

            <p>
              If ye then, being evil, know how to give good gifts unto your children: how much more shall your heavenly Father <em>give the Holy Spirit to them that ask him</em>? <cite><b>Luke 11:13</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              <em>Let this mind be in you</em>, which was also in Christ Jesus. <cite><b>Philippians 2:5</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> All I need to do to receive the Holy Spirit is ask God for it! He wants to bestow the Holy Spirit on all, but He will not do it against anyone’s will, which is why I need to ask. Asking only comes after there’s been a realization of my need of the Spirit, which means there is a heart that’s surrendered to God, dead to self, willing to receive. Paul uses the word “let” to describe the process of receiving the mind of Christ, meaning there is a willingness to yield&mdash;to surrender&mdash;to the sanctifying work of the Holy Spirit. And it truly is His work, not ours, because we cannot change ourselves, but we must be willing to cooperate with Him.

              But the <em>fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, longsuffering, gentleness, goodness, faith, meekness, temperance</em>: against such there is no law. And they that are Christ's have <em>crucified the flesh with the affections and lusts</em>. If we live in the Spirit, let us also walk in the Spirit. Let us not be desirous of vain glory, provoking one another, envying one another. <cite><b>Galatians 5:22-26</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              This I say then, Walk in the Spirit, and ye shall <em>not fulfil the lust of the flesh</em>. <cite><b>Galatians 5:16</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> A life that is filled with the Holy Spirit will produce the fruits of the Spirit, which are the attributes of Jesus, while the carnal, selfish nature will be crucified, or surrendered, to Christ. Notice that these are the fruits <i>of</i> the Spirit, not our own fruits, because we cannot produce them ourselves.

            <p>
              And the earth was without form, and void; and darkness was upon the face of the deep. And the <em>Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters</em>. <cite><b>Genesis 1:2</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              <em>A new heart also will I give you, and a new spirit will I put within you</em>: and I will take away the stony heart out of your flesh, and I will give you an heart of flesh. And <em>I will put my spirit within you, and cause you to walk in my statutes, and ye shall keep my judgments, and do them</em>. <cite><b>Ezekiel 36:26, 27</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              Not by works of righteousness which we have done, but according to his mercy he saved us, <em>by the washing of regeneration, and renewing of the Holy Ghost</em>; which he shed on us abundantly through Jesus Christ our Saviour. <cite><b>Titus 3:5, 6</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              Jesus answered, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, <em>Except a man be born of water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God</em>. That which is born of the flesh is flesh; and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit. Marvel not that I said unto thee, Ye must be born again. The wind bloweth where it listeth [wishes], and thou hearest the sound thereof, but canst not tell whence it cometh, and whither it goeth: so is every one that is born of the Spirit. <cite><b>John 3:5-8</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> Just like the Holy Spirit participated in the work of creation on that first week, He participates in the work of recreating the heart, renewing the mind, and transforming the character after the likeness of Jesus. When the Holy Spirit dwells in us, He will give us a new heart, enabling us to keep God’s commandments and live a genuine, victorious, joyful Christian life. This transplant of the heart is what Jesus referred to when He told Nicodemus that no one can enter the kingdom of God unless born of the Spirit. Like the movement of the wind, the work of the Holy Spirit upon the heart is a mystery to us, but just like the movement of the wind is made evident by its sound, the work of the Spirit will be made evident by its fruits in a person’s life.

            <p>
              And when the day of Pentecost was fully come, they were all with one accord in one place. And suddenly there came a sound from heaven as of a rushing mighty wind, and it filled all the house where they were sitting. And there appeared unto them cloven tongues like as of fire, and it sat upon each of them. <em>And they were all filled with the Holy Ghost</em>, and began to speak with other tongues, as the Spirit gave them utterance. <cite><b>Acts 2:1-4</b></cite>

            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> Jesus’ promise to send the Holy Spirit was fulfilled on the Day of Pentecost when the disciples were filled, or baptized, with the Spirit, receiving various supernatural gifts that enabled them to proclaim the gospel with power. Peter made it clear that God’s genuine followers today are also prepared for service through the same outpouring of the Holy Spirit (<a>Ephesians 4:11-13</a>) when they repent and are baptized (see “Baptism”). And just like the outpouring during Pentecost, there will be another outpouring of the Spirit in the last days, just before Christ’s return, that will enable God’s followers to preach the gospel with power and give the final warning to the world (<a>Acts 3:19-21; Joel 2:28, 29</a>).

              Now there are diversities of gifts, but the same Spirit. And there are differences of administrations, but the same Lord. And there are diversities of operations, but it is the same God which worketh all in all. But the manifestation of the Spirit is given to every man to profit withal.
              <br><br>
              For to one is given by the Spirit the word of <em>wisdom</em>; to another the word of <em>knowledge</em> by the same Spirit; to another <em>faith</em> by the same Spirit; to another the gifts of <em>healing</em> by the same Spirit; to another the <em>working of miracles</em>; to another <em>prophecy</em>; to another <em>discerning of spirits</em>; to another <em>divers kinds of tongues</em>; to another the <em>interpretation of tongues</em>: but all these worketh that one and the selfsame Spirit, <em>dividing to every man severally [separately] as he will</em>. <cite><b>1 Corinthians 12:4-11</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              And he gave some, <em>apostles</em>; and some, <em>prophets</em>; and some, <em>evangelists</em>; and some, <em>pastors</em> and <em>teachers; for the perfecting of the saints, for the work of the ministry, for the edifying of the body of Christ</em>: till we all come in the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of God, unto a perfect man, unto the measure of the stature of the fulness of Christ. <cite><b>Ephesians 4:11-13</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              Having then gifts differing according to the grace that is given to us, whether <em>prophecy</em>, let us prophesy according to the proportion of faith; or <em>ministry</em>, let us wait on our ministering: or he that <em>teacheth</em>, on teaching; or he that <em>exhorteth</em>, on exhortation: he that <em>giveth</em>, let him do it with simplicity; he that <em>ruleth</em>, with diligence; he that <em>sheweth mercy</em>, with cheerfulness. <cite><b>Romans 12:6-8</b></cite>

            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> The Holy Spirit bestows various spiritual gifts on believers to edify the members of the church as well as to minister to those outside of the church.

The Holy Spirit distributes these gifts as He wills, and every believer receives at least one.

            <h2>What does it mean to “speak in tongues”?</h2>
            <p>
              And they were all filled with the Holy Ghost, and <em>began to speak with other tongues</em>, as the Spirit gave them utterance. And there were dwelling at Jerusalem Jews, devout men, <em>out of every nation under heaven</em>. Now when this was noised abroad, the multitude came together, and were confounded, because that <em>every man heard them speak in his own language</em>.
              <br><br>
              And they were all amazed and marvelled, saying one to another, Behold, are not all these which speak Galilaeans? And <em>how hear we every man in our own tongue, wherein we were born</em>? Parthians, and Medes, and Elamites, and the dwellers in Mesopotamia, and in Judaea, and Cappadocia, in Pontus, and Asia, Phrygia, and Pamphylia, in Egypt, and in the parts of Libya about Cyrene, and strangers of Rome, Jews and proselytes, Cretes and Arabians, we do hear them speak in our tongues the wonderful works of God. <cite><b>Acts 2:4-11</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              So likewise ye, except ye <em>utter by the tongue words easy to be understood</em>, how shall it be known what is spoken? for ye shall speak into the air. ... Yet in the church I had rather speak five words with my understanding, that by my voice I might teach others also, <em>than ten thousand words in an unknown tongue</em>. ...
              <br><br>
              If any man speak in an unknown tongue, let it be by two, or at the most by three, and that by course; and <em>let one interpret</em>. But <em>if there be no interpreter, let him keep silence in the church</em>; and let him speak to himself, and to God. Let the prophets speak two or three, and let the other judge. If any thing be revealed to another that sitteth by, let the first hold his peace. For ye may all prophesy one by one, that all may learn, and all may be comforted. And the spirits of the prophets are subject to the prophets. <em>For God is not the author of confusion</em>, but of peace, as in all churches of the saints. <cite><b>1 Corinthians 14:9, 19, 27-33</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              <em>But ye shall receive power, after that the Holy Ghost is come upon you: and ye shall be witnesses unto me</em> both in Jerusalem, and in all Judaea, and in Samaria, and unto the uttermost part of the earth. <cite><b>Acts 1:8</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> Jesus said that the gifts and the filling of the Holy Spirit are for the purpose of witnessing to other people. This was examplified at Pentacost because one of the gifts of the Spirit was an ability to speak other tongues, or languages, and since there were people present in Jerusalem from other nations, the gift was needed so that the gospel could be communicated without any language barriers. The book of Acts mentions tongues only three times (<a>Acts 2:4-11; 10:44-46; 19:4-6</a>), and the Greek word for “tongues” in each of these three instances is the same word used for “tongues” in <a>Revelation 14:6</a>, which means real languages.
              <br><br>
              In 1 Corinthians Paul sheds more light on the subject. He emphasizes that tongues should be spoken that can be understood by those present, and if an unknown tongue is spoken, an interpreter should be used. He then concludes his remarks by making it clear that God is not the author of confusion. So speaking in tongues is a gift of the Spirit that gives a person the ability to speak another language, when that need is present, for the proclamation of the gospel.

            <h2>What warning is given regarding the Holy Spirit?</h2>
            <p>
              And the LORD said, <em>My spirit shall not always strive with man</em>, for that he also is flesh: yet his days shall be an hundred and twenty years. <cite><b>Genesis 6:3</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              And <em>grieve not the Holy Spirit of God</em>, whereby ye are sealed unto the day of redemption. <cite><b>Ephesians 4:30</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> Because the Holy Spirit is a Person, He can be grieved, and when this happens, He stops striving with us, meaning He stops convicting us of sin and of righteousness, no longer leading us to abandon the things that are offensive to God (sins of commission) or to do what is right in the sight of God, which can turn into sins of omission, if refused. Grieving away the Holy Spirit is a frightful position to be in because once He ceases to invite a person to come to Christ there is no hope of salvation left.
              <br><br>
              The Bible compares the Holy Spirit’s revelations of Bible truth with receiving light. As the Holy Spirit guides us into an understanding of Bible truth, and we choose to walk in that revealed light, God will continue giving us more light (<a>Proverbs 4:18, 19</a>), but a persistent rejection of revealed truth can lead to the extinguishing of light, leaving us in the spiritual darkness of error (<a>John 12:35</a>). Paul describes this process as quenching the Spirit (<a>1 Thessalonians 5:19</a>), similar to how water quenches fire.
              <br><br>
              In fact, Paul later warns that this quenching can lead to a delusion where error is accepted as truth (<a>2 Thessalonians 2:10-12</a>), which leads to the experience described in <a>Matthew 7:22, 23</a> where Jesus says “I never knew you” to those who thought they were saved but, actually, were lost because they had quenched the Spirit.
              <br><br>
              In <a>Matthew 7:21</a> Jesus says only those who do the will of His Father will enter the kingdom of heaven, so any teaching of “salvation in sin“ is not from God because it rejects the need of Jesus (as does “salvation by works“). A genuine acceptance of Jesus as Lord and Savior, that is motivated by love and gratitute, always leads to a changed lifestyle that is in harmony with His will, which is salvation <i>from</i> sin <i>by faith</i> in Jesus’ power to forgive, save, and transform (<a>2 Corinthians 5:17; John 14:15</a>). Who choose to obey Him because we <i>are</i> saved, not to <i>be</i> saved.

            <h2>What is blasphemy against the Holy Spirit?</h2>
            <p>
              Wherefore I say unto you, All manner of sin and blasphemy shall be forgiven unto men: but the <em>blasphemy against the Holy Ghost shall not be forgiven unto men</em>. And whosoever speaketh a word against the Son of man, it shall be forgiven him: but whosoever speaketh against the Holy Ghost, it shall not be forgiven him, neither in this world, neither in the world to come. <cite><b>Matthew 12:31, 32</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> We’ve learned that one of the roles of the Holy Spirit is to convict us of sin, and the Bible makes it clear that any sin that is confessed will be forgiven by Jesus (<a>1 John 1:9</a>). Blasphemy against the Holy Spirit, which cannot be forgiven, also known as the unpardonable sin, is a continual resisting or rejection of the Holy Spirit’s convicting, converting power, which leads to sins that are left unconfessed and, therefore, cannot be forgiven. This is why David, after committing the sin of adultery and murder, prayed that God would not take His Holy Spirit from him (<a>Psalm 51:11</a>) because he knew that only the Spirit was able to lead him to repentance and a transformation of heart.
              <br><br>
              God is patient, continuing to plead even with resistant people, but He won’t force Himself on anyone, and there will come a time when His pleading will cease (<a>Genesis 6:3</a>), if continually resisted. Each refusal to surrender to the Holy Spirit’s convictions creates a more hardened heart that is less sensitive to future conviction, and if this is continued, the Spirit will eventually depart, leaving that person to live with the cherished, uncofessed sin for good.
              <br><br>
              It’s unknown how long it takes to reach the point of no return, but one thing is certain: it’s never safe to say “no” to the Holy Spirit. The only wise thing to do is to surrender to the convictions of the Spirit by confessing and forsaking the sin being pointed out (<a>1 John 1:9</a>). By the way, if you feel concerned you have rejected the Holy Spirit then that is evidence you have not.

            <h2>When should I act on the convictions of the Spirit?</h2>
            <p>
              <em>I made haste, and delayed not</em> to keep thy commandments. <cite><b>Psalm 119:60</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              For he saith, I have heard thee in a time accepted, and in the day of salvation have I succoured thee: behold, <em>now is the accepted time; behold, now is the day of salvation</em>. <cite><b>2 Corinthians 6:2</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              And now <em>why tarriest thou?</em> arise, and be baptized, and wash away thy sins, calling on the name of the Lord. <cite><b>Acts 22:16</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> Tomorrow is never guaranteed, so waiting to act on the pleadings of the Holy Spirit is never wise. Let’s not repeat the mistake Felix made when he chose to wait for a more convenient time to act (<a>Acts 24:25</a>), which never came. The good news is every time we choose to respond to the Holy Spirit’s convictions we yield to the power of the Spirit to change the mind and heart, and if we continue to cooperate with Him, He will transform our character to reflect the character of Jesus.

            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> Being Christ’s personal representative on earth, the Holy Spirit’s ministry is about drawing people to and glorifying Jesus, just as Christ’s ministry was about glorifying His Father (<a>John 17:4</a>). Those who have the genuine spiritual gifts of the Spirit will not seek to draw attention to themselves, their own teachings, or the things of the world; the focus will be on Jesus, His teachings, and His heavenly kingdom.

            <h2>What instruction did Jesus give His disciples?</h2>
            <p>
              Go ye therefore, and teach all nations, <em>baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost</em>: teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you: and, lo, I am with you alway, even unto the end of the world. <cite><b>Matthew 28:19, 20</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              He that <em>believeth and is baptized shall be saved</em>; but he that believeth not shall be damned. <cite><b>Mark 16:16</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> Just before Jesus ascended to heaven, He gave His disciples the “Great Commission”&mdash;to take the gospel to the whole world by sharing His teachings and encouraging those who accept Him to get baptized. In fact, the book of Mark makes an inextricable connection between believing in Jesus and being baptized, which shows that baptism is a integral part of the Christian experience.

            <h2>Why is baptism so important?</h2>
            <p>
              Jesus answered, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, <em>Except a man be born of water and of the Spirit</em>, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God. <cite><b>John 3:5</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              That if thou shalt <em>confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus</em>, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved. For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and <em>with the mouth confession is made unto salvation</em>. <cite><b>Romans 10:9, 10</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              For as many of you as have been <em>baptized into Christ have put on Christ</em>. <cite><b>Galatians 3:27</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> During His conversation with Nicodemus, Jesus made it clear that all Christians need to be baptized. Salvation is a gift from God that is received through faith in Jesus Christ (<a>Ephesians 2:8, 9</a>), and Paul, in his letter to the Romans, says that faith is demonstrated through a public confession of Jesus. When we are baptized we are making a public confession that we have “put on Christ”&mdash;accepted Him, as Lord and Savior, into our hearts, which, in turn, gives us a new name and a new identity: follower of Christ, son or daughter of God!

            <h2>How many methods are baptism are there?</h2>
            <p>
              There is one body, and one Spirit, even as ye are called in one hope of your calling; one Lord, one faith, <em>one baptism</em>, one God and Father of all, who is above all, and through all, and in you all. <cite><b>Ephesians 4:4-6</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> The Bible is clear there is only one true baptism, and the word itself is a clue as to what it is. The word “baptize” comes from the Greek word “baptizo,” which means “to immerse,” “to submerge,” or “to dip under.” It might be shocking to some, but the Bible never describes baptism using the words “sprinkle” or “pour.” It’s a full immersion in water.

            <h2>How was Jesus baptized?</h2>
            <p>
              And John also was baptizing in Aenon near to Salim, <em>because there was much water there</em>: and they came, and were baptized. <cite><b>John 3:23</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              Then cometh Jesus from Galilee to Jordan unto John, to be baptized of him. But John forbad him, saying, I have need to be baptized of thee, and comest thou to me? And Jesus answering said unto him, Suffer it to be so now: for thus it becometh us to fulfil all righteousness. Then he suffered him. And <em>Jesus, when he was baptized, went up straightway out of the water</em>: and, lo, the heavens were opened unto him, and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove, and lighting upon him: and lo a voice from heaven, saying, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased. <cite><b>Matthew 3:13-17</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              And it came to pass in those days, that Jesus came from Nazareth of Galilee, and was baptized of John in Jordan. And straightway <em>coming up out of the water</em>, he saw the heavens opened, and the Spirit like a dove descending upon him. <cite><b>Mark 1:9, 10</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> John the Baptist chose an area with lots of water because he practiced the biblical form of baptism by full immersion. Matthew and Mark make it clear that this is the baptism that Jesus, our example in all things, received when they describe Him coming up out of the water, meaning He had to go into the water to be baptized.

            <h2>Are there other examples of baptism?</h2>
            <p>
              And he commanded the chariot to stand still: and <em>they went down both into the water</em>, both Philip and the eunuch; and he baptized him. And when <em>they were come up out of the water</em>, the Spirit of the Lord caught away Philip, that the eunuch saw him no more: and he went on his way rejoicing. <cite><b>Acts 8:38, 39</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> The Bible gives the example of Philip and the eunuch to show that Jesus’ disciples did not change the method of baptism after His ascension. Both Philip and the eunuch went down into the water, and after Philip baptized the eunuch, they came up out of the water. This matches the description and form of baptism that Jesus received.

            <h2>What does baptism represent?</h2>
            <p>
              And now why tarriest thou? arise, and be baptized, and <em>wash away thy sins</em>, calling on the name of the Lord. <cite><b>Acts 22:16</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              <em>Buried with him in baptism</em>, wherein also ye are <em>risen with him through the faith</em> of the operation of God, who hath raised him from the dead. <cite><b>Colossians 2:12</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              Know ye not, that so many of us as were baptized into Jesus Christ were <em>baptized into his death</em>? Therefore we are <em>buried with him by baptism into death</em>: that like <em>as Christ was raised up from the dead</em> by the glory of the Father, even so <em>we also should walk in newness of life</em>. For if we have been planted together in the <em>likeness of his death</em>, we shall be also in the <em>likeness of his resurrection</em>: Knowing this, that <em>our old man is crucified with him, that the body of sin might be destroyed, that henceforth we should not serve sin</em>. <cite><b>Romans 6:3-6</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              That <em>ye put off concerning the former conversation the old man</em>, which is corrupt according to the deceitful lusts; and be renewed in the spirit of your mind; and <em>that ye put on the new man</em>, which after God is created in righteousness and true holiness. <cite><b>Ephesians 4:22-24</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> Baptism is a symbol of cleansing from sin, which every person needs as all have sinned (<a>Romans 3:23</a>), but more specifically, it symbolizes the death and burial of the old life of sin, while being born to a new life in Jesus! In other words, it’s a symbol of Jesus’ death, burial, and resurrection because as we exprience His selfless love for us, it motivates us 1) to die to sin in our own life, which involves dying to self, 2) to bury it under the water in baptism, and 3) to arise to a new life in Jesus by the power of His Holy Spirit. It’s a beautiful, powerful symbol of how Jesus’ death, burial, and resurrection replaced our old identity with an entirely new one in Him!
              <br><br>
              Baptism to a Christian is what a wedding is to a marriage, and using the correct form of baptism matters because any other form destroys the beautiful symbolism and meaning of baptism by immersion. All other forms symbolize a vastly different spiritual reality&mdash;one that does not entail a burial of the old life. Biblical baptism illustrates that the Christian life is more than just being a better person; it’s a complete crucifixion of the old life (<a>Galatians 2:20; 6:14</a>). Any failure to fully surrender every aspect of one’s life to Jesus leads to a baptism where the person is, in a sense, “buried alive,” which is a robbery of the rich blessings that Jesus wants every believer to experience (<a>John 15:11</a>).

            <h2>What else accompanies water baptism?</h2>
            <p>
              Jesus answered, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born of water and <em>of the Spirit</em>, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God. <cite><b>John 3:5</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> In addition to water baptism, every sincere Christian will also receive the baptism of the Holy Spirit because a full immersion in water is not sufficient without being fully immersed by the Holy Spirit. The good news is that God is more than willing to give the Spirit to anyone who asks (<a>Luke 11:13</a>) and desires to be transformed in life and character by His Holy Spirit, who convicts of sin and bestows on us the righteousness of Jesus (<a>John 16:8; Titus 3:3-7</a>). Without the Holy Spirit we cannot change ourselves (<a>Jeremiah 13:23</a>).
              <br><br>
              Evidence of receiving the baptism of the Spirit includes producing the fruits of the Spirit described in <a>Galatians 5:22, 23</a> as well as receiving His gifts (see question 12 of “Holy Spirit”), both of which enable us to be effective ambassadors for God (<a>2 Corinthians 5:19-21</a>).

            <h2>How do I know if I’m ready for baptism?</h2>
            <p>
              Go ye therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost: <em>teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you</em>: and, lo, I am with you alway, even unto the end of the world. <cite><b>Matthew 28:19, 20</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              He that <em>believeth</em> and is baptized shall be saved; but he that believeth not shall be damned. <cite><b>Mark 16:16</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              Then Peter said unto them, <em>Repent</em>, and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins, and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost. <cite><b>Acts 2:38</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              For if we have been planted together in the likeness of his death, we shall be also in the likeness of his resurrection: knowing this, that <em>our old man is crucified with him, that the body of sin might be destroyed, that henceforth we should not serve sin</em>. <cite><b>Romans 6:5, 6</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> Like marriage, baptism is a public commitment to Jesus as my personal Savior (<a>Acts 8:37</a>), so it’s important to first get to know Him and understand His teachings. This is in the commission Jesus gave His disciples just before His ascension&mdash;to share His teachings in all the world and to baptize those who accept them and believe in Him. Naturally, His teachings will bring conviction of sin, leading the genuine believer to repent of past sins (<a>Acts 5:31</a>) and choose to no longer serve sin by dying to self through the power of the Holy Spirit. This experience is known as being born of the Spirit, and if it’s present in a believer’s life then that person is ready to make the exciting, yet serious, public commitment to be faithful to Jesus even to the point of death.
              <br><br>
              Incidentally, this means that infant baptism in not appropriate because an infant is not mature enough to understand the pre-requisites or make the commitment. After all, Jesus Himself was baptized as an adult. Instead of being baptized, infants can be dedicated to God by their parents, as Jesus was (<a>Luke 2:21-39</a>), while the parents also dedicate themselves to do what they can to raise a child who knows and loves God&mdash;who will one day make that commitment in baptism. The Bible, however, does not specify an appropriate age to be baptized because every person’s spiritual experience and maturity is different.

            <p>
              And one of the malefactors which were hanged railed on him, saying, If thou be Christ, save thyself and us. But the other answering rebuked him, saying, Dost not thou fear God, seeing thou art in the same condemnation? And we indeed justly; for we receive the due reward of our deeds: but this man hath done nothing amiss. And he said unto Jesus, <em>Lord, remember me when thou comest into thy kingdom</em>. <cite><b>Luke 23:39-42</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> The conversion of the thief on the cross shows that there can be unique circumstances that prevent an individual from getting baptized by immersion, and in those situations the baptism of Jesus is substituted for that person; however, this is not an excuse for someone who is able, but does not wish to get baptized. Baptism is still a very important public commitment to Jesus.

            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> It’s important to note that we are not saved by baptism as salvation is by grace through faith, but baptism <i>is</i> an act of obedience to Jesus born out of a conversion that’s marked by genuine love for and gratitude to Him. Baptism also doesn’t remove temptations, but God does promise we will not be tempted beyond what we are able to bear, which means He will always provide a way of escape (<a>1 Corinthians 10:13</a>). And finally, baptism itself does not change the heart, but it <i>is</i> a symbol of a heart transformed by the power of the Holy Spirit.

            <p>
              <em>Then they that gladly received his word were baptized</em>: and the same day there were added unto them about three thousand souls. And they <em>continued stedfastly in the apostles' doctrine and fellowship, and in breaking of bread, and in prayers</em>. ... And they, <em>continuing daily with one accord in the temple</em>, and breaking bread from house to house, did eat their meat with gladness and singleness of heart, praising God, and having favour with all the people. And <em>the Lord added to the church daily such as should be saved</em>. <cite><b>Acts 2:41, 42, 46, 47</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              And <em>He is the head of the body, the church</em>, who is the beginning, the firstborn from the dead, that in all things He may have the preeminence. <cite><b>Colossians 1:18</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              For by one Spirit are we all <em>baptized into one body</em>, whether we be Jews or Gentiles, whether we be bond or free; and have been all made to drink into one Spirit. <cite><b>1 Corinthians 12:13</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> When the disciples started proclaiming the teachings of Jesus, those who believed and were baptized became a part of the body of Christ, His church, of which He is Lord. The church is a community of Christ’s followers who nurture one another’s Christian walk and work together to serve others and spread the good news of the gospel. A decision for baptism, therefore, comes with the blessing of fellowship with other followers of Jesus who believe in all of His teachings, as revealed in the Bible, and by the power of the Holy Spirit, live them out.

              He said unto them, Have ye received the Holy Ghost since ye believed? And they said unto him, We have not so much as heard whether there be any Holy Ghost. And he said unto them, Unto what then were ye baptized? And they said, Unto John's baptism. Then said Paul, John verily baptized with the baptism of repentance, saying unto the people, that they should believe on him which should come after him, that is, on Christ Jesus. <em>When they heard this, they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus</em>. <cite><b>Acts 19:2-5</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> Ideally, baptism is a one-time experience, but there are exceptions. Rebaptism can be appropriate when new truth is discovered, which was the case with the group of believers who were baptized by John, but who had never heard of the Holy Spirit. After they learned this life-changing truth, they were so impacted by it that they decided to get rebaptized. Another circumstance when rebaptism is appropriate is when a person desires to return to Jesus after turning away from Him. Baptism is a marriage ceremony with Jesus, so if genuine love has been rekindled in the heart, and it’s accompanied by the commitment to be faithful through thick and thin, it can be appropriate to make a new public pledge to Jesus.

            <h2>Who has the authority to baptize?</h2>
            <p>
              Then the <em>eleven disciples</em> went away into Galilee, into a mountain where Jesus had appointed them. And when they saw him, they worshipped him: but some doubted. And Jesus came and spake unto them, saying, All power is given unto me in heaven and in earth. <em>Go ye therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them</em> in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost: teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you: and, lo, I am with you alway, even unto the end of the world. <cite><b>Matthew 28:16-20</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> Jesus gave the authority to baptize only to His disciples, whom He commissioned to faithfully teach all the truths He had commanded them. When the Holy Spirit leads a person to receive baptism, it’s crucial to seek a church that teaches all the aspects of truth that Jesus had taught (see “God’s Remnant Church”).

            <h2>Is it wise to put off baptism?</h2>
            <p>
              And now <em>why tarriest thou? arise, and be baptized</em>, and wash away thy sins, calling on the name of the Lord. <cite><b>Acts 22:16</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              And as he reasoned of righteousness, temperance, and judgment to come, Felix trembled, and answered, Go thy way for this time; <em>when I have a convenient season, I will call for thee</em>. <cite><b>Acts 24:25</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> When the Holy Spirit brings conviction to the heart, one of Satan’s most effective strategies is to cause that person to put off making a decision until a more convenient time, which never comes. Don’t put off baptism because you are not “good enough” or don’t feel “clean.” We begin our Christian walk as babies, not adults, and if babies waited to attempt to walk until certain they would never fall, they would never learn to walk. So if the Holy Spirit is prompting you to be baptized, the Bible invites you to make plans today without delay.

            <h2>How does God feel about a baptized person?</h2>
            <p>
              I say unto you, that likewise <em>joy shall be in heaven over one sinner that repenteth</em>, more than over ninety and nine just persons, which need no repentance. <cite><b>Luke 15:7</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              In that day it shall be said to Jerusalem: “Do not fear; Zion, let not your hands be weak. The Lord your God in your midst, the Mighty One, will save; <em>He will rejoice over you with gladness</em>, He will quiet you with His love, <em>He will rejoice over you with singing</em>.” <cite><b>Zephaniah 3:16, 17, NKJV</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> Not only is there joy in heaven over every repenting sinner, but Zephaniah tells us that God Himself rejoices in song over His people! The truth is we have the ability to make heaven rejoice, and stepping into the waters of baptism to make a public commitment to Jesus is bound to bring melodies of joy to the heavenly courts.
