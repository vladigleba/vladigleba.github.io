            <h2>How much of the Bible is inspired by God? For what purpose?</h2>
            <p>
              <em>All</em> Scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable <em>for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness</em>, that the man of God may be complete, thoroughly equipped for every good work. <cite><b>2 Timothy 3:16, 17</b></cite>

            <h2>How did it maintain its miraculous unity?</h2>
            <p>
              Knowing this first, that no prophecy of Scripture is of any private interpretation, for prophecy never came by the will of man, but holy men of God spoke <em>as they were moved by the Holy Spirit</em>. <cite><b>2 Peter 1:20, 21</b></cite>
            </p>
          </section>

            <h2>Can the Bible be trusted?</h2>
            <p>
              The entirety of Your word is <em>truth</em>, and every one of Your righteous judgments endures forever. <cite><b>Psalm 119:160</b></cite>

            <h2>But hasn’t it been corrupted over the ages?</h2>
            <p>
              The words of the Lord are <em>pure words</em>, like silver tried in a furnace of earth, purified seven times. You shall keep them, O Lord, You shall <em>preserve them</em> from this generation forever. <cite><b>Psalm 12:6, 7</b></cite>
            </p>
          </section>
          <section>
            <div>5</div>
            <h2>Can God’s Word be changed or done away with?</h2>
            <p>
              Heaven and earth will pass away, but <em>My words will by no means pass away</em>. <cite><b>Matthew 24:35</b></cite>

            <h2>Why did God gave us the Scriptures?</h2>
            <p>
              For whatever things were written before were written for our learning, that we through the patience and comfort of the Scriptures might <em>have hope</em>. <cite><b>Romans 15:4</b></cite>

            <div>7</div>
            <h2>What is another crucial reason?</h2>
            <p>
              And that from childhood you have known the Holy Scriptures, which are able to make you wise for <em>salvation</em> through faith which is in Christ Jesus. <cite><b>2 Timothy 3:15</b></cite>
            </p>

            <div>8</div>
            <h2>Who do the Scriptures point me to?</h2>
            <p>
              You search the Scriptures, for in them you think you have eternal life; and these are they which <em>testify of Me</em>. <cite><b>John 5:39</b></cite>

            <h2>How can I be blessed by the Bible?</h2>
            <p>
              <em>Study</em> to shew thyself approved unto God, a workman that needeth not to be ashamed, rightly dividing the word of truth. <cite><b>2 Timothy 2:15, KJV</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              These were more noble than those in Thessalonica, in that they received the word with all readiness of mind, and <em>searched the scriptures daily</em>, whether those things were so. <cite><b>Acts 17:11, KJV</b></cite>

            <h2>Is God’s Word as important as physical food?</h2>
            <p>
              Man shall not live by bread alone, but by <em>every word that proceeds from the mouth of God</em>. <cite><b>Matthew 4:4</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              I have treasured the words of His mouth <em>more than my necessary food</em>. <cite><b>Job 23:12</b></cite>

          </section>
          <section>
            <div>11</div>
            <h2>Who did Jesus say will help me understand the Bible?</h2>
            <p>
              However, when He, the Spirit of truth, has come, <em>He will guide you into all truth</em>; for He will not speak on His own authority, but whatever He hears He will speak; and He will tell you things to come. <cite><b>John 16:13</b></cite>
            </p>
          </section>
          <section>
            <div>12</div>
            <h2>Why should I ask for the Holy Spirit’s guidance?</h2>
            <p>
              These things we also speak, not in words which man’s wisdom teaches but which the Holy Spirit teaches, comparing spiritual things with spiritual. But the natural man does not receive the things of the Spirit of God, for they are foolishness to him; nor can he know them, because they are <em>spiritually discerned</em>. <cite><b>1 Corinthians 2:13</b></cite>

            <h2>How should I study the Bible?</h2>
            <p>
              Whom will he teach knowledge? And whom will he make to understand the message? Those just weaned from milk? Those just drawn from the breasts? For precept must be upon precept, <em>precept upon precept, line upon line</em>, line upon line, <em>here a little, there a little</em>. <cite><b>Isaiah 28:9, 10</b></cite>

              <em>By the word of the Lord</em> the heavens were made, and all the host of them <em>by the breath of His mouth</em>. He gathers the waters of the sea together as a heap; He lays up the deep in storehouses. Let all the earth fear the Lord; let all the inhabitants of the world stand in awe of Him.

              The kingdom of heaven is like a man who sowed good seed in his field; but while men slept, <em>his enemy came and sowed tares among the wheat</em> and went his way. But when the grain had sprouted and produced a crop, then the tares also appeared. So the servants of the owner came and said to him, “Sir, did you not sow good seed in your field?

You were in Eden, the garden of God; every precious stone was your covering: the sardius, topaz, and diamond, beryl, onyx, and jasper, sapphire, turquoise, and emerald with gold. The workmanship of your timbrels and pipes was prepared for you on the day you were created. You were the anointed cherub who covers; I established you; you were on the holy mountain of God; you walked back and forth in the midst of fiery stones. <em>You were perfect in your ways from the day you were created, till iniquity was found in you</em>. <cite><b>Ezekiel 28:12-15</b></cite>

            <p>
              So <em>God created man in His own image</em>; in the image of God He created him; male and female He created them. Then God blessed them, and God said to them, “<em>Be fruitful and multiply</em>; fill the earth and subdue it; have dominion over the fish of the sea, over the birds of the air, and over every living thing that moves on the earth.” And God said, “See, I have given you every herb that yields seed which is on the face of all the earth, and every tree whose fruit yields seed; to you it shall be for food. Also, to every beast of the earth, to every bird of the air, and to everything that creeps on the earth, in which there is life, I have given every green herb for food”; and it was so. Then God saw everything that He had made, and indeed it was very good. So the evening and the morning were the sixth day. <cite><b>Genesis 1:27-31</b></cite>

            <p>
              Now the serpent was more cunning than any beast of the field which the Lord God had made. And he said to the woman, “Has God indeed said, ‘You shall not eat of every tree of the garden’?” And the woman said to the serpent, “We may eat the fruit of the trees of the garden; but of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden, God has said, ‘You shall not eat it, nor shall you touch it, lest you die.’” Then the serpent said to the woman, “You will not surely die. For God knows that in the day you eat of it your eyes will be opened, and <em>you will be like God</em>, knowing good and evil.” So when the woman saw that the tree was good for food, that it was pleasant to the eyes, and a tree desirable to make one wise, she took of its fruit and ate. She also gave to her husband with her, and he ate. Then the eyes of both of them were opened, and they knew that they were naked; and they sewed fig leaves together and made themselves coverings. <cite><b>Genesis 3:1-7</b></cite>

Therefore, as through one man’s offense judgment came to all men, resulting in condemnation, even so through one Man’s righteous act the <em>free gift came to all men, resulting in justification of life</em>. For as by one man’s disobedience many were made sinners, so also by one Man’s obedience many will be <em>made righteous</em>.

Thou hast loved righteousness, and hated iniquity; therefore <em>God, even thy God, hath anointed thee</em> with the oil of gladness <em>above thy fellows</em>.” <cite><b>Hebrews 1:5-9, KJV</b></cite>

              Let this mind be in you, which was also in Christ Jesus: who, <em>being in the form of God</em>, thought it not robbery to be <em>equal with God</em>: but made himself of no reputation, and took upon him the form of a servant, and was made in the likeness of men: and being found in fashion as a man, he humbled himself, and became obedient unto death, even the death of the cross. Wherefore God also hath highly exalted him, and given him a name which is above every name: that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of things in heaven, and things in earth, and things under the earth; and that <em>every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord</em>, to the glory of God the Father. Wherefore, my beloved, as ye have always obeyed, not as in my presence only, but now much more in my absence, work out your own salvation with fear and trembling. <cite><b>Philippians 2:5-12, KJV</b></cite>

Then <em>God blessed them</em>, and God said to them, “Be fruitful and multiply; fill the earth and subdue it; have dominion over the fish of the sea, over the birds of the air, and over every living thing that moves on the earth.” And God said, “See, I have given you every herb that yields seed which is on the face of all the earth, and every tree whose fruit yields seed; to you it shall be for food. Also, to every beast of the earth, to every bird of the air, and to everything that creeps on the earth, in which there is life, I have given every green herb for food”; and it was so. Then <em>God saw everything that He had made, and indeed it was very good</em>. So the evening and the morning were the sixth day. <cite><b>Genesis 1:27-31</b></cite>
