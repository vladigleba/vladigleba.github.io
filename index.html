            <h2>How much of the Bible is inspired by God? For what purpose?</h2>
            <p>
              <em>All</em> Scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable <em>for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness</em>, that the man of God may be complete, thoroughly equipped for every good work. <cite><b>2 Timothy 3:16, 17</b></cite>

            <h2>How did it maintain its miraculous unity?</h2>
            <p>
              Knowing this first, that no prophecy of Scripture is of any private interpretation, for prophecy never came by the will of man, but holy men of God spoke <em>as they were moved by the Holy Spirit</em>. <cite><b>2 Peter 1:20, 21</b></cite>
            </p>

            <h2>Can the Bible be trusted?</h2>
            <p>
              The entirety of Your word is <em>truth</em>, and every one of Your righteous judgments endures forever. <cite><b>Psalm 119:160</b></cite>

            <h2>But hasn’t it been corrupted over the ages?</h2>
            <p>
              The words of the Lord are <em>pure words</em>, like silver tried in a furnace of earth, purified seven times. You shall keep them, O Lord, You shall <em>preserve them</em> from this generation forever. <cite><b>Psalm 12:6, 7</b></cite>

            <div>5</div>
            <h2>Can God’s Word be changed or done away with?</h2>
            <p>
              Heaven and earth will pass away, but <em>My words will by no means pass away</em>. <cite><b>Matthew 24:35</b></cite>

            <h2>Why did God gave us the Scriptures?</h2>
            <p>
              For whatever things were written before were written for our learning, that we through the patience and comfort of the Scriptures might <em>have hope</em>. <cite><b>Romans 15:4</b></cite>

            <div>7</div>
            <h2>What is another crucial reason?</h2>
            <p>
              And that from childhood you have known the Holy Scriptures, which are able to make you wise for <em>salvation</em> through faith which is in Christ Jesus. <cite><b>2 Timothy 3:15</b></cite>
            </p>

            <div>8</div>
            <h2>Who do the Scriptures point me to?</h2>
            <p>
              You search the Scriptures, for in them you think you have eternal life; and these are they which <em>testify of Me</em>. <cite><b>John 5:39</b></cite>

            <h2>How can I be blessed by the Bible?</h2>
            <p>
              <em>Study</em> to shew thyself approved unto God, a workman that needeth not to be ashamed, rightly dividing the word of truth. <cite><b>2 Timothy 2:15, KJV</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              These were more noble than those in Thessalonica, in that they received the word with all readiness of mind, and <em>searched the scriptures daily</em>, whether those things were so. <cite><b>Acts 17:11, KJV</b></cite>

            <h2>Is God’s Word as important as physical food?</h2>
            <p>
              Man shall not live by bread alone, but by <em>every word that proceeds from the mouth of God</em>. <cite><b>Matthew 4:4</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              I have treasured the words of His mouth <em>more than my necessary food</em>. <cite><b>Job 23:12</b></cite>

            <div>11</div>
            <h2>Who did Jesus say will help me understand the Bible?</h2>
            <p>
              However, when He, the Spirit of truth, has come, <em>He will guide you into all truth</em>; for He will not speak on His own authority, but whatever He hears He will speak; and He will tell you things to come. <cite><b>John 16:13</b></cite>

          </section>
          <section>
            <div>12</div>
            <h2>Why should I ask for the Holy Spirit’s guidance?</h2>
            <p>
              These things we also speak, not in words which man’s wisdom teaches but which the Holy Spirit teaches, comparing spiritual things with spiritual. But the natural man does not receive the things of the Spirit of God, for they are foolishness to him; nor can he know them, because they are <em>spiritually discerned</em>. <cite><b>1 Corinthians 2:13</b></cite>

            <h2>How should I study the Bible?</h2>
            <p>
              Whom will he teach knowledge? And whom will he make to understand the message? Those just weaned from milk? Those just drawn from the breasts? For precept must be upon precept, <em>precept upon precept, line upon line</em>, line upon line, <em>here a little, there a little</em>. <cite><b>Isaiah 28:9, 10</b></cite>

              <em>By the word of the Lord</em> the heavens were made, and all the host of them <em>by the breath of His mouth</em>. He gathers the waters of the sea together as a heap; He lays up the deep in storehouses. Let all the earth fear the Lord; let all the inhabitants of the world stand in awe of Him.

              The kingdom of heaven is like a man who sowed good seed in his field; but while men slept, <em>his enemy came and sowed tares among the wheat</em> and went his way. But when the grain had sprouted and produced a crop, then the tares also appeared. So the servants of the owner came and said to him, “Sir, did you not sow good seed in your field?

You were in Eden, the garden of God; every precious stone was your covering: the sardius, topaz, and diamond, beryl, onyx, and jasper, sapphire, turquoise, and emerald with gold. The workmanship of your timbrels and pipes was prepared for you on the day you were created. You were the anointed cherub who covers; I established you; you were on the holy mountain of God; you walked back and forth in the midst of fiery stones. <em>You were perfect in your ways from the day you were created, till iniquity was found in you</em>. <cite><b>Ezekiel 28:12-15</b></cite>

            <p>
              So <em>God created man in His own image</em>; in the image of God He created him; male and female He created them. Then God blessed them, and God said to them, “<em>Be fruitful and multiply</em>; fill the earth and subdue it; have dominion over the fish of the sea, over the birds of the air, and over every living thing that moves on the earth.”
            </p>
            <p>
              And God said, “See, I have given you every herb that yields seed which is on the face of all the earth, and every tree whose fruit yields seed; to you it shall be for food. Also, to every beast of the earth, to every bird of the air, and to everything that creeps on the earth, in which there is life, I have given every green herb for food”; and it was so. Then God saw everything that He had made, and indeed <em>it was very good</em>. So the evening and the morning were the sixth day. <cite><b>Genesis 1:27-31</b></cite>

              Now the serpent was more cunning than any beast of the field which the Lord God had made. And he said to the woman, “Has God indeed said, ‘You shall not eat of every tree of the garden’?” And the woman said to the serpent, “We may eat the fruit of the trees of the garden; but of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden, God has said, ‘You shall not eat it, nor shall you touch it, lest you die.’” Then the serpent said to the woman, “You will not surely die.

              So when the woman saw that the tree was good for food, that it was pleasant to the eyes, and a tree desirable to make one wise, she took of its fruit and ate. She also gave to her husband with her, and he ate. Then <em>the eyes of both of them were opened, and they knew that they were naked</em>; and they sewed fig leaves together and made themselves coverings. <cite><b>Genesis 3:6-7</b></cite>

              Inasmuch then as the children have partaken of flesh and blood, He Himself likewise shared in the same, that <em>through death He might destroy him who had the power of death</em>, that is, the devil, and <em>release those who through fear of death were all their lifetime subject to bondage</em>. For indeed He does not give aid to angels, but He does give aid to the seed of Abraham. Therefore, in all things He had to be made like His brethren, that He might be a merciful and faithful High Priest in things pertaining to God, <em>to make propitiation for the sins of the people</em>.

              For if by the one man’s offense death reigned through the one, much more <em>those who receive abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness will reign in life through the One, Jesus Christ</em>. Therefore, as through one man’s offense judgment came to all men, resulting in condemnation, even so through one Man’s righteous act the <em>free gift came to all men, resulting in justification of life</em>. For as by one man’s disobedience many were made sinners, so also by one Man’s obedience many will be <em>made righteous</em>.

Then <em>God blessed them</em>, and God said to them, “Be fruitful and multiply; fill the earth and subdue it; have dominion over the fish of the sea, over the birds of the air, and over every living thing that moves on the earth.” And God said, “See, I have given you every herb that yields seed which is on the face of all the earth, and every tree whose fruit yields seed; to you it shall be for food. Also, to every beast of the earth, to every bird of the air, and to everything that creeps on the earth, in which there is life, I have given every green herb for food”; and it was so. Then <em>God saw everything that He had made, and indeed it was very good</em>. So the evening and the morning were the sixth day. <cite><b>Genesis 1:27-31</b></cite>

              <em>Ask, and it will be given to you</em>; seek, and you will find; knock, and it will be opened to you. <em>For everyone who asks receives</em>, and he who seeks finds, and to him who knocks it will be opened. <cite><b>Matthew 7:7, 8</b></cite>

            </p>
            <p>
              What shall we then say to these things? <em>If God be for us, who can be against us</em>? He that spared not His own Son, but delivered Him up for us all, <em>how shall He not with Him also freely give us all things</em>? <cite><b>Romans 8:31, 32, KJV</b></cite>

              <b>Note:</b> There is no sin too powerful for God, but He cannot do anything against my will either. If I confess my sins and ask Him to give me victory over them, believing that He is powerful enough to do it, He will do it according to my faith.

            <p>
              Now in the second year of Nebuchadnezzar’s reign, Nebuchadnezzar <em>had dreams</em>; and his spirit was so troubled that his sleep left him. <cite><b>Daniel 2:1</b></cite>

              Then <em>the king gave the command</em> to call the magicians, the astrologers, the sorcerers, and the Chaldeans <em>to tell the king his dreams</em>. So they came and stood before the king. And the king said to them, “I have had a dream, and my spirit is anxious to know the dream.” Then the Chaldeans spoke to the king in Aramaic, “O king, live forever! Tell your servants the dream, and we will give the interpretation.”
            </p>
            <p>
              The king answered and said to the Chaldeans, “My decision is firm: if you do not make known the dream to me, and its interpretation, you shall be cut in pieces, and your houses shall be made an ash heap. However, if you tell the dream and its interpretation, you shall receive from me gifts, rewards, and great honor. Therefore tell me the dream and its interpretation.” They answered again and said, “Let the king tell his servants the dream, and we will give its interpretation.”
            </p>
            <p>
              The king answered and said, “I know for certain that you would gain time, because you see that my decision is firm: if you do not make known the dream to me, there is only one decree for you! For you have agreed to speak lying and corrupt words before me till the time has changed. Therefore tell me the dream, and I shall know that you can give me its interpretation.”
            </p>
            <p>
              The Chaldeans answered the king, and said, “There is not a man on earth who can tell the king’s matter; therefore no king, lord, or ruler has ever asked such things of any magician, astrologer, or Chaldean. <em>It is a difficult thing that the king requests, and there is no other who can tell it to the king except the gods</em>, whose dwelling is not with flesh.”
            </p>

               This is the dream. Now we will tell the interpretation of it before the king. You, O king, are a king of kings. For the God of heaven has given you a kingdom, power, strength, and glory; and wherever the children of men dwell, or the beasts of the field and the birds of the heaven, He has given them into your hand, and has made you ruler over them all&mdash;<em>you are this head of gold</em>. <cite><b>Daniel 2:36-38</b></cite>

            <p>
              As you saw iron mixed with ceramic clay, they will mingle with the seed of men; but <em>they will not adhere to one another</em>, just as iron does not mix with clay. <cite><b>Daniel 2:43</b></cite>

            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> Despite attempts by Charlemagne, Napoleon, Kaiser Wilhelm II, and Hitler to unite Europe, it will never be reunited again. Even the European Union cannot succeed because the Bible says they will not adhere to one another.

            <h2>What would come after it?</h2>
            <p>
              And in the days of these kings the God of heaven will set up <em>a kingdom which shall never be destroyed</em>; and the kingdom shall not be left to other people; it shall break in pieces and consume all these kingdoms, and <em>it shall stand forever</em>. Inasmuch as you saw that the stone was cut out of the mountain without hands, and that it broke in pieces the iron, the bronze, the clay, the silver, and the gold&mdash;the great God has made known to the king what will come to pass after this. The dream is certain, and its interpretation is sure. <cite><b>Daniel 2:44-45</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <b>Note:</b> The stone cut without hands represents the kingdom of heaven, which will replace all the earthly kingdoms at the coming of Christ, and His reign will have no end. Since the stone strikes the image’s feet, Jesus will come during the time of the divided nations.

              Now when He had spoken these things, while they watched, He was taken up, and a cloud received Him out of their sight. And while they looked steadfastly toward heaven as He went up, behold, two men stood by them in white apparel, who also said, “Men of Galilee, why do you stand gazing up into heaven? This same Jesus, who was taken up from you into heaven, <em>will so come in like manner as you saw Him go into heaven</em>.” <cite><b>Acts 1:9-11</b></cite>

Then we who are alive and remain shall be <em>caught up together with them in the clouds</em> to meet the Lord in the air.

And the kings of the earth, the great men, the rich men, the commanders, the mighty men, every slave and every free man, <em>hid themselves</em> in the caves and in the rocks of the mountains, and said to the mountains and rocks, “<em>Fall on us and hide us from the face of Him who sits on the throne and from the wrath of the Lamb</em>!

The field is the world, the good seeds are the sons of the kingdom, but the tares are the sons of the wicked one. The enemy who sowed them is the devil, the harvest is the end of the age, and the reapers are the angels. Therefore as the tares are gathered and burned in the fire, so it will be at the end of this age. The Son of Man will send out His angels, and <em>they will gather out of His kingdom all things that offend, and those who practice lawlessness</em>, and will cast them into the furnace of fire.

            <p>
              Now I saw heaven opened, and behold, a white horse. And He who sat on him was called Faithful and True, and in righteousness He judges and makes war. His eyes were like a flame of fire, and <em>on His head were many crowns</em>. He had a name written that no one knew except Himself. He was clothed with a robe dipped in blood, and His name is called The Word of God. And <em>the armies in heaven, clothed in fine linen, white and clean, followed Him</em> on white horses. Now out of His mouth goes a sharp sword, that with it He should strike the nations. And He Himself will rule them with a rod of iron. He Himself treads the winepress of the fierceness and wrath of Almighty God. And He has on His robe and on His thigh a name written: <em>KING OF KINGS AND LORD OF LORDS</em>. <cite><b>Revelation 19:11-16</b></cite>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
