            <h2>1</h2>
            <p>
              All Scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness, that the man of God may be complete, thoroughly equipped for every good work. (2 Timothy 3:16, 17)
            </p>
            <h2>2</h2>
            <p>
              Knowing this first, that no prophecy of Scripture is of any private interpretation, for prophecy never came by the will of man, but holy men of God spoke as they were moved by the Holy Spirit. (2 Peter 1:20, 21)
            </p>
            <h2>3</h2>
            <p>
              The entirety of Your word is truth, and every one of Your righteous judgments endures forever. (Psalm 119:160)
            </p>
            <h2>4</h2>
            <p>
              The words of the Lord are pure words, like silver tried in a furnace of earth, purified seven times. You shall keep them, O Lord, You shall preserve them from this generation forever. (Psalm 12:6, 7)
            </p>
            <h2>5</h2>
            <p>
              Heaven and earth will pass away, but My words will by no means pass away. (Matthew 24:35)
            </p>
            <h2>6</h2>
            <p>
              For whatever things were written before were written for our learning, that we through the patience and comfort of the Scriptures might have hope. (Romans 15:4)
            </p>
            <h2>7</h2>
            <p>
              And that from childhood you have known the Holy Scriptures, which are able to make you wise for salvation through faith which is in Christ Jesus. (2 Timothy 3:15)
            </p>
            <h2>8</h2>
            <p>
              Search the scriptures; for in them ye think ye have eternal life: and they are they which testify of me.  (John 5:39, KJV)
            </p>
            <h2>9</h2>
            <p>
              Study to shew thyself approved unto God, a workman that needeth not to be ashamed, rightly dividing the word of truth. (2 Timothy 2:15, KJV)
            </p>
            <h2>10</h2>
            <p>
              However, when He, the Spirit of truth, has come, He will guide you into all truth; for He will not speak on His own authority, but whatever He hears He will speak; and He will tell you things to come. (John 16:13)
            </p>
            <h2>11</h2>
            <p>
              These things we also speak, not in words which man’s wisdom teaches but which the Holy Spirit teaches, comparing spiritual things with spiritual. (1 Corinthians 2:13)
            </p>
            <h2>12</h2>
            <p>
              Whom will he teach knowledge? And whom will he make to understand the message? Those just weaned from milk? Those just drawn from the breasts? For precept must be upon precept, precept upon precept, line upon line, line upon line, here a little, there a little. (Isaiah 28:9, 10)
            </p>
            <h2>13</h2>
            <p>
              Sanctify them through thy truth: thy word is truth. (John 17:17, KJV)
            </p>
            <h2>14</h2>
            <p>
              If any man will do his will, he shall know of the doctrine, whether it be of God, or whether I speak of myself. (John 7:17, KJV)

            <h2>5</h2>
            <p>
              Tell and bring forth your case; yes, let them take counsel together. Who has declared this from ancient time? Who has told it from that time? Have not I, the Lord? And there is no other God besides Me, a just God and a Savior; there is none besides Me. (Isaiah 45:21)
            </p>
            <h2>6</h2>
            <p>
              By the word of the Lord the heavens were made, and all the host of them by the breath of His mouth. ... For He spoke, and it was done; He commanded, and it stood fast. (Psalm 33:6, 9)

              And the Lord passed before him and proclaimed, “The Lord, the Lord God, merciful and gracious, longsuffering, and abounding in goodness and truth, keeping mercy for thousands, forgiving iniquity and transgression and sin, by no means clearing the guilty, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children and the children’s children to the third and the fourth generation.” (Exodus 34:6, 7)
            </p>
            <h2>8</h2>

            <h2>11</h2>
            <p>
              I will bless the Lord at all times; His praise shall continually be in my mouth. My soul shall make its boast in the Lord; the humble shall hear of it and be glad.

When you pass through the waters, I will be with you; and through the rivers, they shall not overflow you. When you walk through the fire, you shall not be burned, nor shall the flame scorch you. For I am the Lord your God, the Holy One of Israel, your Savior." (Isaiah 43:1-3)
