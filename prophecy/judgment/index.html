<figure><blockquote>
<p>And I saw another angel fly in the midst of heaven, having the everlasting gospel to preach unto them that dwell on the earth, and to every nation, and kindred, and tongue, and people, saying with a loud voice, Fear God, and give glory to him; <em>for the hour of his judgment is come</em>: and worship him that made heaven, and earth, and the sea, and the fountains of waters.</p>
</blockquote><figcaption>— Revelation 14:6, 7</figcaption></figure>

<figure><blockquote>
<p>And, behold, I come quickly; and my reward is with me, <em>to give every man according as his work shall be</em>.</p>
</blockquote><figcaption>— Revelation 22:12</figcaption></figure>

<p>In <a>Acts 24:25</a> Paul talks about a coming judgment, meaning it had not happened yet. In Revelation 14, on the other hand, there are three angels proclaiming a message to the people of the world in the last days, and the first angel’s message is that the judgment has begun. So the judgment begins in the last days, which we are living in (see <a href="/prophecy/investigative/">“2,300 Day Prophecy”</a>). When Jesus comes back to earth He’s bringing a reward with Him, which means the judgment has already taken place to decide who will be saved and what their reward will be.</p>

<figure><blockquote>
<p>For <em>we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ</em>; that every one may receive the things done in his body, according to that he hath done, whether it be good or bad.</p>
</blockquote><figcaption>— 2 Corinthians 5:10</figcaption></figure>

<figure><blockquote>
<p>So then <em>every one of us shall give account of himself to God</em>.</p>
</blockquote><figcaption>— Romans 14:12</figcaption></figure>

<p>Every person who has ever lived on planet earth will be judged. Furthermore, each person will be responsible for his or her own actions; it will not be possible to hide behind another person’s decisions, actions, or ultimatums.</p>

<figure><blockquote>
<p>I beheld till the thrones were cast down, and <em>the Ancient of Days did sit</em>, whose garment was white as snow, and the hair of his head like the pure wool: his throne was like the fiery flame, and his wheels as burning fire. A fiery stream issued and came forth from before him: thousand thousands ministered unto him, and ten thousand times ten thousand stood before him: the <em>judgment was set, and the books were opened</em>.</p>
</blockquote><figcaption>— Daniel 7:9, 10</figcaption></figure>

<figure><blockquote>
<p>For the Father judgeth no man, but hath <em>committed all judgment unto the Son</em>.</p>
</blockquote><figcaption>— John 5:22</figcaption></figure>

<figure><blockquote>
<p>My little children, these things write I unto you, that ye sin not. And if any man sin, <em>we have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous</em>.</p>
</blockquote><figcaption>— 1 John 2:1</figcaption></figure>

<figure><blockquote>
<p>And the great dragon was cast out, that old serpent, called <em>the Devil, and Satan</em>, which deceiveth the whole world: he was cast out into the earth ... for <em>the accuser of our brethren</em> is cast down, which accused them before our God day and night.</p>
</blockquote><figcaption>— Revelation 12:9, 10</figcaption></figure>

<p>God the Father, the Ancient of Days, presides over the judgment, while Jesus is the Judge, as well as our Advocate! Satan is our only accusser, declaring that we don’t deserve to be saved any more than he does.</p>

<figure><blockquote>
<p>Let us hear the conclusion of the whole matter: Fear God, and keep his commandments: for this is the whole duty of man. For <em>God shall bring every work into judgment, with every secret thing</em>, whether it be good, or whether it be evil.</p>
</blockquote><figcaption>— Ecclesiastes 12:13, 14</figcaption></figure>

<figure><blockquote>
<p>But I say unto you, That <em>every idle word that men shall speak, they shall give account thereof</em> in the day of judgment.</p>
</blockquote><figcaption>— Matthew 12:36</figcaption></figure>

<figure><blockquote>
<p>Neither is there any creature that is not manifest in his sight: but <em>all things are naked and opened unto the eyes of him with whom we have to do</em>.</p>
</blockquote><figcaption>— Hebrews 4:13</figcaption></figure>

<figure><blockquote>
<p>Therefore judge nothing before the time, until the Lord come, who both will <em>bring to light the hidden things of darkness, and will make manifest the counsels of the hearts</em>: and then shall every man have praise of God.</p>
</blockquote><figcaption>— 1 Corinthians 4:5</figcaption></figure>

<figure><blockquote>
<p>And I saw the dead, small and great, stand before God; and the books were opened: and another book was opened, which is the book of life: and <em>the dead were judged out of those things which were written in the books, according to their works</em>.</p>
</blockquote><figcaption>— Revelation 20:12</figcaption></figure>

<figure><blockquote>
<p>And there shall in no wise enter into it any thing that defileth, neither whatsoever worketh abomination, or maketh a lie: <em>but they which are written in the Lamb's book of life</em>.</p>
</blockquote><figcaption>— Revelation 21:27</figcaption></figure>

<figure><blockquote>
<p>For though thou wash thee with nitre, and take thee much soap, yet <em>thine iniquity is marked before me</em>, saith the Lord GOD.</p>
</blockquote><figcaption>— Jeremiah 2:22</figcaption></figure>

<figure><blockquote>
<p>Then those who feared the Lord spoke to one another, and the Lord listened attentively and heard it, and a <em>book of remembrance was written before Him for those who fear the Lord and esteem His name</em>.</p>
</blockquote><figcaption>— Malachi 3:16, NASB</figcaption></figure>

<p>Evidence for the judgment comes from books containing every detail of a person’s life, including every sin. There is also a Book of Remembrance containing every kind word, unselfish act, or sacrifice made by those who follow Jesus as evidence of God’s transforming power in their lives. These people’s names are also written in the Book of Life.</p>

<figure><blockquote>
<p>If ye fulfil the royal law according to the scripture, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself, ye do well: But if ye have respect to persons, ye commit sin, and are <em>convinced of the law as transgressors</em>. For whosoever shall keep the whole law, and yet offend in one point, he is guilty of all. For he that said, Do not commit adultery, said also, Do not kill. Now if thou commit no adultery, yet if thou kill, thou art become a transgressor of the law. So speak ye, and so do, as they that <em>shall be judged by the law of liberty</em>.</p>
</blockquote><figcaption>— James 2:10-12</figcaption></figure>

<figure><blockquote>
<p>Whosoever committeth sin transgresseth also the law: for <em>sin is the transgression of the law</em>.</p>
</blockquote><figcaption>— 1 John 3:4</figcaption></figure>

<p>If God keeps a record of our sins, and sin is the transgression of the law, then the Ten Commandment law is God’s standard by which we will be judged.</p>
<h2 id="is-anyone-righteous-before-the-law">Is anyone righteous before the law?<a href="#is-anyone-righteous-before-the-law" class="anchor-link" aria-label="Copy link"></a></h2>
<figure><blockquote>
<p>For <em>all have sinned</em>, and come short of the glory of God.</p>
</blockquote><figcaption>— Romans 3:23</figcaption></figure>

<figure><blockquote>
<p>Wherefore, as by one man sin entered into the world, and death by sin; and so <em>death passed upon all men</em>, for that all have sinned.</p>
</blockquote><figcaption>— Romans 5:12</figcaption></figure>

<p>Because all have sinned, everyone is under condemnation before the law. If nothing is done to remedy the situation, by default, every person sits on “death row” and simply waits for the judgment.</p>
<h2 id="how-can-my-record-of-sin-be-blotted-out">How can my record of sin be blotted out?<a href="#how-can-my-record-of-sin-be-blotted-out" class="anchor-link" aria-label="Copy link"></a></h2>
<figure><blockquote>
<p><em>Repent ye therefore, and be converted, that your sins may be blotted out</em>, when the times of refreshing shall come from the presence of the Lord.</p>
</blockquote><figcaption>— Acts 3:19</figcaption></figure>

<figure><blockquote>
<p>Seek ye the LORD while he may be found, call ye upon him while he is near: <em>Let the wicked forsake his way, and the unrighteous man his thoughts</em>: and let him return unto the LORD, and he will have mercy upon him; and to our God, for <em>he will abundantly pardon</em>.</p>
</blockquote><figcaption>— Isaiah 55:6-7</figcaption></figure>

<p>Even though all have sinned, every person has hope of forgiveness! God the Father offers forgiveness to all who come to Him in repentance and forsaking of sin.</p>
<h2 id="what-role-does-jesus-play-in-this">What role does Jesus play in this?<a href="#what-role-does-jesus-play-in-this" class="anchor-link" aria-label="Copy link"></a></h2>
<figure><blockquote>
<p>But this man, because he continueth ever, hath an unchangeable priesthood. Wherefore he is able also to save them to the uttermost that come unto God by him, seeing <em>he ever liveth to make intercession for them</em>.</p>
</blockquote><figcaption>— Hebrews 7:24, 25</figcaption></figure>

<figure><blockquote>
<p>For we have not an high priest which cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities; but was <em>in all points tempted like as we are, yet without sin</em>. Let us therefore come boldly unto the throne of grace, that we may obtain mercy, and find grace to help in time of need.</p>
</blockquote><figcaption>— Hebrews 4:15-16</figcaption></figure>

<p>Because Jesus understands us and can sympathize with our weaknesses, He also intercedes on our behalf when we come to God through Him asking for forgiveness.</p>
<h2 id="what-role-does-the-holy-spirit-play">What role does the Holy Spirit play?<a href="#what-role-does-the-holy-spirit-play" class="anchor-link" aria-label="Copy link"></a></h2>
<figure><blockquote>
<p>Nevertheless I tell you the truth; It is expedient for you that I go away: for if I go not away, the Comforter will not come unto you; but if I depart, I will send him unto you. And when he is come, <em>he will reprove the world of sin</em>, and of righteousness, and of judgment.</p>
</blockquote><figcaption>— John 16:7, 8</figcaption></figure>

<figure><blockquote>
<p>But the Comforter, which is the Holy Ghost, whom the Father will send in my name, he shall teach you all things, and <em>bring all things to your remembrance</em>, whatsoever I have said unto you.</p>
</blockquote><figcaption>— John 14:26</figcaption></figure>

<p>The Holy Spirit plays a crucial role as well by convicting us of sin and bringing to remembrance sins we have not confessed yet so there isn’t a single unconfessed sin left in our heavenly record for Satan to point to as a witness against us in the judgment.</p>
<h2 id="what-happens-to-those-whose-record-of-sin-has-been-removed">What happens to those whose record of sin has been removed?<a href="#what-happens-to-those-whose-record-of-sin-has-been-removed" class="anchor-link" aria-label="Copy link"></a></h2>
<figure><blockquote>
<p>There is therefore now <em>no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus</em>, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit. For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus hath made me free from the law of sin and death. For what the law could not do, in that it was weak through the flesh, God sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh, and for sin, condemned sin in the flesh: <em>that the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit</em>.</p>
</blockquote><figcaption>— Romans 8:1-4</figcaption></figure>

<figure><blockquote>
<p>He that overcometh, the same shall be <em>clothed in white raiment</em>; and I will <em>not blot out his name out of the book of life</em>, but I will confess his name before my Father, and before his angels.</p>
</blockquote><figcaption>— Revelation 3:5</figcaption></figure>

<figure><blockquote>
<p>Notwithstanding in this rejoice not, that the spirits are subject unto you; but rather <em>rejoice, because your names are written in heaven</em>.</p>
</blockquote><figcaption>— Luke 10:20</figcaption></figure>

<p>Those whose record of sin has been blotted out are no longer under condemnation because they have been forgiven through Christ, who paid the penalty for their sin on the cross and who stands before the law on their behalf with His perfect character. The law can now be fulfilled in them through the abiding presence and enabling power of the Spirit, and their names will not be blotted out from the Book of Life!</p>
<h2 id="what-warning-did-jesus-give-to-christians">What warning did Jesus give to Christians?<a href="#what-warning-did-jesus-give-to-christians" class="anchor-link" aria-label="Copy link"></a></h2>
<figure><blockquote>
<p>And take heed to yourselves, lest at any time your hearts be overcharged with <em>surfeiting, and drunkenness, and cares of this life</em>, and so that day come upon you unawares.</p>
</blockquote><figcaption>— Luke 21:34</figcaption></figure>

<figure><blockquote>
<p>For the Son of man is as a man taking a far journey, who left his house, and gave authority to his servants, and to every man his work, and commanded the porter to watch. Watch ye therefore: for ye know not when the master of the house cometh, at even, or at midnight, or at the cockcrowing, or in the morning: <em>Lest coming suddenly he find you sleeping</em>.</p>
</blockquote><figcaption>— Mark 13:34-36</figcaption></figure>

<p>Jesus warned about four specific things:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Surfeiting</em>: This means “excess,” and it can be anything that disturbs balance and violates the principle of temperance (<a>Galatians 5:22-25</a>), such as overeating, overwork, or even recreation, which is very beneficial when done it moderation.</li>
<li><em>Drunkenness</em>: This is anything that brings about a spiritual stupor, destroys clear thinking, and removes our desire for heavenly things. Examples include pornography, alcoholism, illicit sex, worldly entertainment, and so on, because they lead to living in a dream world.</li>
<li><em>Cares of this life</em>: These are perfectly fine activities that are a part of life, but when they take over our lives they take time away from Jesus and shift our focus away from eternal realities, leading to less time spent in prayer, studying His word, and being an active member of His church.</li>
<li><em>Sleeping</em>: Jesus is referring to spiritually asleep here, and this involves taking the Bible and the truth it reveals about Him for granted. It’s being indifferent about our relationship with Jesus and neglecting the principles of His kingdom (<a>2 Timothy 3:5</a>). In <a>Revelation 3:15-19</a> it’s described as being lukewarm—being falsely satisfied with one’s own spiritual condition and not being actively involved in the work of Jesus. Perhaps the biggest problem with sleep is being unaware that one is asleep! But the good news is Jesus still patiently knocks at the door of the heart. Have you let Him in?</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="what-did-felix-do-when-he-was-convicted">What did Felix do when he was convicted?<a href="#what-did-felix-do-when-he-was-convicted" class="anchor-link" aria-label="Copy link"></a></h2>
<figure><blockquote>
<p>And as he reasoned of righteousness, temperance, and judgment to come, Felix trembled, and answered, <em>Go thy way for this time; when I have a convenient season, I will call for thee</em>.</p>
</blockquote><figcaption>— Acts 24:25</figcaption></figure>

<figure><blockquote>
<p>For he saith, I have heard thee in a time accepted, and in the day of salvation have I succoured thee: behold, now is the accepted time; behold, <em>now is the day of salvation</em>.</p>
</blockquote><figcaption>— 2 Corinthians 6:2</figcaption></figure>

<p>When the Holy Spirit convicts it is not wise to ignore it or put it off to a more convenient time because that time may never come. Tomorrow is not guaranteed; today is the day to get right with God.</p>
