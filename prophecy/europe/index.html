<figure><blockquote>
<p>And in the second year of the reign of Nebuchadnezzar Nebuchadnezzar <em>dreamed dreams</em>, wherewith his spirit was troubled, and his sleep brake from him. Then the <em>king commanded to call the magicians, and the astrologers, and the sorcerers, and the Chaldeans, for to shew the king his dreams</em>. So they came and stood before the king. And the king said unto them, I have dreamed a dream, and my spirit was troubled to know the dream. Then spake the Chaldeans to the king in Syriack, O king, live for ever: tell thy servants the dream, and we will shew the interpretation.</p>
<p>The king answered and said to the Chaldeans, The thing is gone from me: if ye will not make known unto me the dream, with the interpretation thereof, ye shall be cut in pieces, and your houses shall be made a dunghill. But if ye shew the dream, and the interpretation thereof, ye shall receive of me gifts and rewards and great honour: therefore shew me the dream, and the interpretation thereof. They answered again and said, Let the king tell his servants the dream, and we will shew the interpretation of it.</p>
<p>The king answered and said, I know of certainty that ye would gain the time, because ye see the thing is gone from me. But if ye will not make known unto me the dream, there is but one decree for you: for ye have prepared lying and corrupt words to speak before me, till the time be changed: therefore tell me the dream, and I shall know that ye can shew me the interpretation thereof.</p>
<p>The Chaldeans answered before the king, and said, There is not a man upon the earth that can shew the king's matter: therefore there is no king, lord, nor ruler, that asked such things at any magician, or astrologer, or Chaldean. And <em>it is a rare thing that the king requireth, and there is none other that can shew it before the king, except the gods</em>, whose dwelling is not with flesh.</p>
<p>For this cause <em>the king was angry and very furious, and commanded to destroy all the wise men of Babylon</em>.</p>

<p>And the decree went forth that the wise men should be slain; and they sought Daniel and his fellows to be slain. ... Then <em>Daniel went in, and desired of the king that he would give him time</em>, and that he would shew the king the interpretation.</p>
</blockquote><figcaption>— Daniel 2:13, 16</figcaption></figure>

<p>Daniel and his friends were also under the death sentence that the king pronounced on the wise men, so when he heard about it, he quickly went to the king to ask for more time.</p>

<p>God saved their life by revealing the king’s dream and its interpratation, and Daniel gave God all the credit.</p>

<figure><blockquote>
<p>As for thee, O king, thy thoughts came into thy mind upon thy bed, <em>what should come to pass hereafter</em>: and he that revealeth secrets maketh known to thee what shall come to pass. But as for me, this secret is not revealed to me for any wisdom that I have more than any living, but for their sakes that shall make known the interpretation to the king, and <em>that thou mightest know the thoughts of thy heart</em>.</p>
</blockquote><figcaption>— Daniel 2:29-30</figcaption></figure>

<p>The dream was an answer to the king wondering what the future would hold for his kingdom.</p>

<figure><blockquote>
<p>Thou sawest till that <em>a stone was cut out without hands, which smote the image</em> upon his feet that were of iron and clay, and <em>brake them to pieces</em>. Then was the iron, the clay, the brass, the silver, and the gold, broken to pieces together, and became like the chaff of the summer threshing floors; and the wind carried them away, that no place was found for them: and the <em>stone that smote the image became a great mountain, and filled the whole earth</em>.</p>

<figure><blockquote>
<p>This is the dream; and we will tell the interpretation thereof before the king. Thou, O king, art a king of kings: for the God of heaven hath given thee a kingdom, power, and strength, and glory. And wheresoever the children of men dwell, the beasts of the field and the fowls of the heaven hath he given into thine hand, and hath made thee ruler over them all. <em>Thou art this head of gold</em>.</p>
</blockquote><figcaption>— Daniel 2:36-38</figcaption></figure>

<p>Aptly symbolized by a head of gold, Babylon was one of the most extravagant kingdoms of antiquity that ruled from 612 B.C. onward after conquering the Assyrian capital of Nineveh. The city walls were almost 200 feet high and wide enough for two chariots, while the Hanging Gardens were one of the seven wonders of the world.</p>

<figure><blockquote>
<p>In that night was Belshazzar the king of the Chaldeans slain. And <em>Darius the Median took the kingdom</em>, being about threescore and two years old.</p>
</blockquote><figcaption>— Daniel 5:30, 31</figcaption></figure>

<p>Babylon was conquered by Cyrus in 539 B.C., which made the kingdom of Medo-Persia the next ruling power. During their reign, all taxes had to be paid in silver.</p>

<p>That saith to the deep, Be dry, and I will <em>dry up thy rivers</em>: that saith of <em>Cyrus</em>, He is my shepherd, and shall perform all my pleasure: even saying to Jerusalem, Thou shalt be built; and to the temple, Thy foundation shall be laid.</p>
</blockquote><figcaption>— Isaiah 44:27, 28</figcaption></figure>

<figure><blockquote>
<p>Thus saith the LORD to his anointed, to <em>Cyrus</em>, whose right hand I have holden, to subdue nations before him; and I will loose the loins of kings, to open before him the two leaved gates; and <em>the gates shall not be shut</em>.</p>
</blockquote><figcaption>— Isaiah 45:1</figcaption></figure>

<p>According to the ancient historian, Herodotus, when Cyrus surrounded Babylon his armies diverted the Euphrates River that flowed through the city, which allowed them to pass under the walls of Babylon by walking on the riverbed. Babylon also had street gates that controlled access to the river, but that night the gates were left open!</p>

<p>The ram which thou sawest having two horns are the kings of Media and Persia. And the rough goat is the <em>king of Grecia</em>: and the great horn that is between his eyes is the first king.</p>
</blockquote><figcaption>— Daniel 8:20, 21</figcaption></figure>

<p>Alexander the Great conquered the Medes and Persians at the battle of Arbela in 331 B.C., which made the brass kingdom of Greece the next dominant world power. The armor of the Greek soldiers was all bronze.</p>
<h2 id="how-is-the-fourth-kingdom-described">How is the fourth kingdom described?<a href="#how-is-the-fourth-kingdom-described" class="anchor-link" aria-label="Copy link"></a></h2>
<figure><blockquote>
<p>And the fourth kingdom shall be <em>strong as iron</em>: forasmuch as iron breaketh in pieces and subdueth all things: and as iron that breaketh all these, shall it break in pieces and bruise.</p>
</blockquote><figcaption>— Daniel 2:40</figcaption></figure>

<p>The iron monarchy of Rome conquered the Greeks in 168 B.C. and was the world power when Jesus was born. The legs of iron are a fitting symbol as its long reign of over 600 years resulted in much persecution of God’s people.</p>
<h2 id="what-kind-of-kingdom-did-the-feet-and-toes-represent">What kind of kingdom did the feet and toes represent?<a href="#what-kind-of-kingdom-did-the-feet-and-toes-represent" class="anchor-link" aria-label="Copy link"></a></h2>
<figure><blockquote>
<p>And whereas thou sawest the feet and toes, part of potters' clay, and part of iron, the <em>kingdom shall be divided</em>; but there shall be in it of the strength of the iron, forasmuch as thou sawest the iron mixed with miry clay. And as the toes of the feet were part of iron, and part of clay, so the <em>kingdom shall be partly strong, and partly broken</em>.</p>
</blockquote><figcaption>— Daniel 2:41, 42</figcaption></figure>

<p>After the Roman empire crumled in A.D. 476, it was divided by barbarian tribes into numerous kingdoms symbolized by the toes on the image, seven of which exist today: the Ostrogoths (gone), Visigoths (Spain), Franks (France), Vandals (gone), Alemannians (Germany), Sueves (Portugal), Anglo-Saxons (England), Heruli (gone), and Lombards (Italy). The toes being partly of iron and partly of clay means some would be stronger than others.</p>
<h2 id="would-it-ever-unite-into-one">Would it ever unite into one?<a href="#would-it-ever-unite-into-one" class="anchor-link" aria-label="Copy link"></a></h2>
<figure><blockquote>
<p>And whereas thou sawest iron mixed with miry clay, they shall mingle themselves with the seed of men: but <em>they shall not cleave one to another</em>, even as iron is not mixed with clay.</p>
</blockquote><figcaption>— Daniel 2:43</figcaption></figure>

<p>Despite attempts by Charlemagne, Napoleon, Kaiser Wilhelm II, and Hitler to unite Europe, it will never be reunited again. Even the European Union cannot succeed because the Bible says they will not adhere to one another.</p>
<h2 id="what-would-come-after-it">What would come after it?<a href="#what-would-come-after-it" class="anchor-link" aria-label="Copy link"></a></h2>
<figure><blockquote>
<p>And in the days of these kings shall the God of heaven set up <em>a kingdom, which shall never be destroyed</em>: and the kingdom shall not be left to other people, but it shall break in pieces and consume all these kingdoms, and <em>it shall stand for ever</em>. Forasmuch as thou sawest that the stone was cut out of the mountain without hands, and that it brake in pieces the iron, the brass, the clay, the silver, and the gold; the great God hath made known to the king what shall come to pass hereafter: and the dream is certain, and the interpretation thereof sure.</p>
</blockquote><figcaption>— Daniel 2:44-45</figcaption></figure>

<p>The stone cut without hands represents the kingdom of heaven, which will replace all the earthly kingdoms at the coming of Christ, and His reign will have no end. Since the stone strikes the image’s feet, Jesus will come during the time of the divided nations.</p>
