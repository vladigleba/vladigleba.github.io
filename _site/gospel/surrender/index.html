<p>To wit, that <em>God was in Christ, reconciling the world unto himself</em>, not imputing their trespasses unto them; and hath <em>committed unto us the word of reconciliation</em>.</p>

<figure><blockquote>
<p>Stand therefore, having your loins girt about with truth, and having on the breastplate of righteousness; and <em>your feet shod with the preparation of the gospel of peace</em>.</p>
</blockquote><figcaption>— Ephesians 6:14-15</figcaption></figure>

<p>Ever since Lucifer chose to exercise his freedom of choice to exalt self above God, the dissonant note of selfishness has marred the perfect harmony of God’s government. When Lucifer succeeded in infecting Adam and Eve with this virus of self-exaltation, a war began to rage in the heart of every human being between self and God. The way God has handled this rebellion against Himself and His legitimate authority, by risking everything in order to reconcile the human race back to Himself through the sacrifice of His only Son, Jesus Christ, has shone new light on the justice of His governemnt and the mercy of His character.</p>
<p>After His ascension, Jesus committed this work of reconciliation, the proclamation of the gospel of peace, to His followers so that every human being would have the opportunity to be reconciled to God, because the truth is every person is at war with his or her Creator, knowingly or unknowingly, until the decision is made to surrender the fight.</p>

<p>Know ye not, that <em>to whom ye yield yourselves servants to obey</em>, his servants ye are to whom ye obey; whether of sin unto death, or of obedience unto righteousness?</p>
</blockquote><figcaption>— Romans 6:16</figcaption></figure>

<p>The Bible presents only two sides for us to choose from: God or Satan, good or evil, righteousness or sin, selflessness or selfishness, life or death. The side we yield, or surrender, to is the side we choose to serve. Our loving Father, Creator, and Reedemer invites us to surrender our will to Him moment by moment because His will for our lives is better, higher, and grander than our own (<a href="https://bible-api.com/Isaiah%2055%3A8-9?translation=kjv" class="verse-link" data-reference="Isaiah 55:8-9" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Isaiah 55:8-9</a>).</p>

<p>And he went a little further, and fell on his face, and prayed, saying, O my Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me: nevertheless <em>not as I will, but as thou wilt</em>.</p>
</blockquote><figcaption>— Matthew 26:39</figcaption></figure>

<p>Just before His betrayal by Judas, Jesus went through the darkest time of His earthly life while He contemplated the events He had to soon pass through, but even though His humanity shrank from the suffering, humiliation, and the weight of sin He had to bear for every human being, He chose to follow the will of His Father rather than His own. In doing so, He opened the door of blessing, reconciliation, and salvation to every member of the human family.</p>

</blockquote><figcaption>— Romans 7:18-19</figcaption></figure>

<p>Our fallen human nature makes it natural for us to live for self rather than for God. We may have the <em>desire</em> to live for God but fall short in our <em>ability</em> to do it.</p>

<figure><blockquote>
<p>For we ourselves also were sometimes foolish, disobedient, deceived, serving divers lusts and pleasures, living in malice and envy, hateful, and hating one another. But after that the kindness and love of God our Saviour toward man appeared, not by works of righteousness which we have done, but <em>according to his mercy he saved us, by the washing of regeneration, and renewing of the Holy Ghost; which he shed on us abundantly through Jesus Christ our Saviour</em>; that being justified by his grace, we should be made heirs according to the hope of eternal life.</p>
</blockquote><figcaption>— Titus 3:3-7</figcaption></figure>

<figure><blockquote>
<p>For if ye live after the flesh, ye shall die: but if ye <em>through the Spirit</em> do mortify the deeds of the body, ye shall live.</p>
</blockquote><figcaption>— Romans 8:13</figcaption></figure>

<p>The good news is Jesus Christ, through the regenerating, renewing power of the Holy Spirit, gives us the ability to experience victory in the battle against self, allowing us to live in harmony with the will of God!</p>

<p>This I say then, <em>Walk in the Spirit, and ye shall not fulfil the lust of the flesh</em>. For the flesh lusteth against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh: and these are contrary the one to the other: so that ye cannot do the things that ye would. But if ye be led of the Spirit, ye are not under the law.</p>
</blockquote><figcaption>— Galatians 5:16-18</figcaption></figure>

<p>Every day we make a choice whether we are guided by our own desires and inclinations (the flesh) or by the Spirit of God. We receive freedom from the slavery of selfishness and sinfulness only when we choose to walk in the Spirit, being guided by it moment by moment. When this happens, we give God permission to carry out His will in our lives.</p>

<figure><blockquote>
<p>But God forbid that I should glory, save in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, <em>by whom the world is crucified unto me, and I unto the world</em>.</p>

<figure><blockquote>
<p>And they that are Christ’s have <em>crucified the flesh with the affections and lusts</em>.</p>
</blockquote><figcaption>— Galatians 5:24</figcaption></figure>

<p>We begin walking in the Spirit when we choose to surrender to God, which Paul describes as a crucifixion of, or death to, self. Putting away self, which is in conflict with the Spirit, allows Christ to live His life in us by faith, and we then become a new creation in Jesus (<a href="https://bible-api.com/2%20Corinthians%205%3A17?translation=kjv" class="verse-link" data-reference="2 Corinthians 5:17" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2 Corinthians 5:17</a>)!</p>

<figure><blockquote>
<p>Know ye not, that so many of us as were baptized into Jesus Christ were baptized into his death? Therefore <em>we are buried with him by baptism into death</em>: that like as Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the Father, even so we also should walk in newness of life. For if we have been planted together in the likeness of his death, we shall be also in the likeness of his resurrection: knowing this, that <em>our old man is crucified with him, that the body of sin might be destroyed, that henceforth we should not serve sin</em>. For he that is dead is freed from sin.</p>
</blockquote><figcaption>— Romans 6:3-7</figcaption></figure>

<p>The decision to give our life over to Jesus is synonymous we the decision to die to self because that is the only way He can reign on the throne of our heart. <a href="/basics/baptism/">Baptism</a> is a beautiful symbol of this burial of self, along with the old life of sin, demonstrated by the submersion into water, <em>and</em> of the resurrection from that burial to a new life in Jesus, demonstrated by the coming out of water.</p>

<figure><blockquote>
<p>I protest by your rejoicing which I have in Christ Jesus our Lord, <em>I die daily</em>.</p>
</blockquote><figcaption>— 1 Corinthians 15:31</figcaption></figure>

<p>Jesus says that those who desire to follow Him will make a daily decision to deny self. Paul echoes this when he says that death to self is a daily occurance for him, not a one-time experience, because it is the consistent connection with Christ that recreates His character in His people.</p>

<p>Growing in Christ is the work of a lifetime, and it’s truly His work, made possible by a daily surrender to Him. As long as we continue to cooperate with God, He will continue to grow us in grace, leading us into a deeper relationship with Him as He molds our characters to more accurately reflect His own. Receiving the righteous, loving character of Jesus is the greatest privilege and honor of every human being.</p>

<figure><blockquote>
<p>My little children, these things write I unto you, that ye sin not. And <em>if any man sin, we have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous</em>: and he is the propitiation for our sins: and not for ours only, but also for the sins of the whole world.</p>
</blockquote><figcaption>— 1 John 2:1-2</figcaption></figure>

<p>God is gracious and merciful; He does not give up on us when we make mistakes! He is always willing to forgive the repentant person, and Jesus Christ, our Advocate in heaven, is ready to cover our shortcomings with His own righteousness, pleading His own blood on our behalf, when we genuinely repent of our sins. When learning to walk it’s not unusual for a child to fall down, but problems arise when the child stops getting up. Such a state of discouragement is Satan’s ultimate goal. But God is a patient, loving parent, who stoops down to meet us where we are, always ready to lift us back up if we stretch out our hand to Him (<a href="https://bible-api.com/Micah%207%3A7-8?translation=kjv" class="verse-link" data-reference="Micah 7:7-8" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Micah 7:7-8</a>).</p>
<p>Of course, we don’t want to abuse His grace and become presumptuous by choosing to cling to sin, because the wages of sin is death (<a href="https://bible-api.com/Romans%203%3A23?translation=kjv" class="verse-link" data-reference="Romans 3:23" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Romans 3:23</a>). Sin is so serious that the Father had to give up His own Son to a death on the cross because of it. The repentant sinner who truly loves Jesus and appreciates His sacrifice will develop a hatred of sin.</p>

<p>When we yield ourselves to Christ, He starts living and working in us, giving us both the <em>willingness</em> and the <em>ability</em> to do His will. This is the gospel, the good news of forgiveness, cleansing, and restoration that Jesus has made freely available to anyone who asks for it! If Jesus could restore the demoniac (<a href="https://bible-api.com/Mark%205%3A1-15?translation=kjv" class="verse-link" data-reference="Mark 5:1-15" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mark 5:1-15</a>), He can restore anybody from the most hopeless circumstances.</p>

<p>When Jesus talked about His Father sending the Holy Spirit, He equated the Spirit with His own presence because He said “I will come to you.” We’ve already learned that we have victory over self through Jesus Christ, and now we know He dwells in us through the gift of the Holy Spirit. So it is <em>His</em> power and <em>His</em> armor, not our own, that makes us strong, enabling us to live a life that’s pleasing to Him.</p>

<p>Then will I sprinkle clean water upon you, and ye shall be clean: <em>from all your filthiness, and from all your idols, will I cleanse you. A new heart also will I give you, and a new spirit will I put within you</em>: and I will take away the stony heart out of your flesh, and I will give you an heart of flesh. And I will put my spirit within you, and <em>cause you to walk in my statutes, and ye shall keep my judgments, and do them</em>.</p>

<p>The transformation of character—the renewal of mind and the purifying of heart—is what God is after. He cannot do this without our cooperation, without a total surrender of our will to Him, but to those who ask Him to take their life as they cling to His promise and power to transform, Jesus gives the same assurance He gave to the suffering woman, “be of good comfort: thy faith hath made thee whole” (<a href="https://bible-api.com/Luke%208%3A48?translation=kjv" class="verse-link" data-reference="Luke 8:48" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Luke 8:48</a>).</p>

<figure><blockquote>
<p>Now unto him that <em>is able to keep you from falling, and to present you faultless before the presence of his glory with exceeding joy</em>, to the only wise God our Saviour, be glory and majesty, dominion and power, both now and ever. Amen.</p>

<figure><blockquote>
<p>And the very God of peace sanctify you wholly; and I pray God your whole spirit and soul and body be preserved blameless unto the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ. <em>Faithful is he that calleth you, who also will do it</em>.</p>

<p>As long as we continue to choose Christ daily, we are complete in Him (<a href="https://bible-api.com/Colossians%202%3A10?translation=kjv" class="verse-link" data-reference="Colossians 2:10" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Colossians 2:10</a>), who gives us help and power, who has promised to perform the work He has begun in our hearts, and to present us faultless before His glory!</p>

<figure><blockquote>
<p>And the LORD descended in the cloud, and stood with him there, and <em>proclaimed the name of the LORD</em>. And the LORD passed by before him, and proclaimed, The LORD, The LORD God, <em>merciful and gracious, longsuffering, and abundant in goodness and truth, keeping mercy for thousands, forgiving iniquity and transgression and sin, and that will by no means clear the guilty</em>; visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children, and upon the children’s children, unto the third and to the fourth generation.</p>

<p>Salvation goes beyond justification by faith in Jesus and includes sanctification, also by faith (<a href="https://bible-api.com/1%20Corinthians%206%3A9-11?translation=kjv" class="verse-link" data-reference="1 Corinthians 6:9-11" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">1 Corinthians 6:9-11</a>). Yes, it’s about the gift of eternal life (<a href="https://bible-api.com/John%203%3A16?translation=kjv" class="verse-link" data-reference="John 3:16" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">John 3:16</a>), but it’s also about total freedom from the degrading power of sin, total restoration of the image of God in fallen humanity. Following Christ goes beyond the knowledge of, and belief in, truth as revealed in His Word. Christianity is the complete, total surrender to the will of God, so that He can write His name—the attributes of His character—on our foreheads, a symbol for our mind. Fallen humanity redeemed to reflect the beauty of God’s character is the great aim of the plan of redemption (<a href="https://bible-api.com/2%20Peter%201%3A4?translation=kjv" class="verse-link" data-reference="2 Peter 1:4" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2 Peter 1:4</a>). What an honor!</p>
