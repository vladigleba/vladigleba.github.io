When Lucifer succeeded in infecting Adam and Eve with this virus of self-exaltation, a war began to rage in the heart of every human being between self and God. The way God has handled this rebellion against Himself and His legitimate authority, by risking everything in order to reconcile the human race back to Himself through the sacrifice of His only Son, Jesus Christ, has shone new light on the justice of His government and the mercy of His character.</p><p data-search-id="paragraph-1">After His ascension, Jesus committed this work of reconciliation, the proclamation of the gospel of peace, to His followers so that every human being would have the opportunity to be reconciled to God, because the truth is every person is at war with his or her Creator, knowingly or unknowingly, until the decision is made to surrender the fight.</p></section>

The side we yield, or surrender, to is the side we choose to serve. Our loving Father, Creator, and Reedemer invites us to surrender our will to Him moment by moment because His will for our lives is better, higher, and grander than our own (<a href="https://bible-api.com/Isaiah%2055%3A8-9?translation=kjv" class="verse-link" data-reference="Isaiah 55:8-9" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Isaiah 55:8-9</a>).</p></section>

In doing so, He opened the door of blessing, reconciliation, and salvation to every member of the human family.</p></section>

Putting away self, which is in conflict with the Spirit, allows Christ to live His life in us by faith, and we then become a new creation in Jesus (<a href="https://bible-api.com/2%20Corinthians%205%3A17?translation=kjv" class="verse-link" data-reference="2 Corinthians 5:17" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2 Corinthians 5:17</a>)!</p></section>

As long as we continue to cooperate with God, He will continue to grow us in grace, leading us into a deeper relationship with Him as He molds our characters to more accurately reflect His own. Receiving the righteous, loving character of Jesus is the greatest privilege and honor of every human being.</p></section>

</blockquote><figcaption>— 1 John 2:1-2</figcaption></figure><p data-search-id="paragraph-11">God is gracious and merciful; He does not give up on us when we make mistakes! He is always willing to forgive the repentant person, and Jesus Christ, our Advocate in heaven, is ready to cover our shortcomings with His own righteousness, pleading His own blood on our behalf, when we genuinely repent of our sins. When learning to walk it’s not unusual for a child to fall down, but problems arise when the child stops getting up. Such a state of discouragement is Satan’s ultimate goal. But God is a patient, loving parent, who stoops down to meet us where we are, always ready to lift us back up if we stretch out our hand to Him (<a href="https://bible-api.com/Micah%207%3A7-8?translation=kjv" class="verse-link" data-reference="Micah 7:7-8" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Micah 7:7-8</a>).</p><p data-search-id="paragraph-12">Of course, we don’t want to abuse His grace and become presumptuous by choosing to cling to sin, because the wages of sin is death (<a href="https://bible-api.com/Romans%203%3A23?translation=kjv" class="verse-link" data-reference="Romans 3:23" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Romans 3:23</a>). Sin is so serious that the Father had to give up His own Son to a death on the cross because of it. The repentant sinner who truly loves Jesus and appreciates His sacrifice will develop a hatred of sin.</p></section>
