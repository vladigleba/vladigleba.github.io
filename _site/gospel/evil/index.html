He was also a covering cherub, which means he had a high position in heaven and was next to God’s very presence. It’s unknown how long perfection existed in heaven, but eventually evil was born in Lucifer’s heart because he aall of God’s angels had freedom of choice. This is a risk God willingly took because genuine love cannot exist without a free will.</p></section>

<p>And God said, Behold, I have given you every herb bearing seed, which is upon the face of all the earth, and every tree, in the which is the fruit of a tree yielding seed; to you it shall be for meat. And to every beast of the earth, and to every fowl of the air, and to every thing that creepeth upon the earth, wherein there is life, I have given every green herb for meat: and it was so. And God saw every thing that he had made, and, behold, <em>it was very good</em>. And the evening and the morning were the sixth day.</p>

And the woman said unto the serpent, We may eat of the fruit of the trees of the garden: But of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden, God hath said, Ye shall not eat of it, neither shall ye touch it, lest ye die. And the serpent said unto the woman, Ye shall not surely die: For God doth know that in the day ye eat thereof, then <em>your eyes shall be opened, and ye shall be as gods, knowing good and evil</em>.</p>
</blockquote><figcaption>— Genesis 3:1-5</figcaption></figure><p>Satan used a serpent to deceive Eve and contradict God by telling her that not only would she not die if she ate the fruit, but she would also become like God, which is exactly what Satan himself desired in heaven. The implication was that God was holding her back from reaching her fullest potential, and Satan was actually the one who had her best interests in mind, not God.</p></section>

And <em>the eyes of them both were opened, and they knew that they were naked</em>; and they sewed fig leaves together, and made themselves aprons.</p>
</blockquote><figcaption>— Genesis 3:6-7</figcaption></figure><p>In order to deceive Eve, Satan mixed in some truth with his lie when he said she would know good and evil because now that they had sinned against God, Adam and Eve lost their innocence, and their eyes were indeed opened to shame, grief, suffering, pain, and death, but they did not ascend to a higher state of existence, as Satan had promised. It was not God’s will for them to know evil, but because Adam and Eve had chosen to believe Satan’s version of reality, he was now free to proceed with establishing his form of government on Earth.</p></section>

<p>Forasmuch then as the children are partakers of flesh and blood, he also himself likewise took part of the same; that <em>through death he might destroy him that had the power of death</em>, that is, the devil; And <em>deliver them who through fear of death were all their lifetime subject to bondage</em>. For verily he took not on him the nature of angels; but he took on him the seed of Abraham.Wherefore in all things it behoved him to be made like unto his brethren, that he might be a merciful and faithful high priest in things pertaining to God, <em>to make reconciliation for the sins of the people</em>.</p>
</blockquote><figcaption>— Hebrews 2:14-17</figcaption></figure><p>Once Adam and Eve fell, God did not leave them in their hopeless condition but gave them a promise that sin would not reign on earth forever. A Redeemer would come who would crush the head of Satan and break the power of sin and death over the human race by paying for their sins Himself.</p></section>

<p>For if by one man’s offence death reigned by one; much more <em>they which receive abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness shall reign in life by one, Jesus Christ</em>. Therefore as by the offence of one judgment came upon all men to condemnation; even so by the righteousness of one the <em>free gift came upon all men unto justification of life</em>. For as by one man’s disobedience many were made sinners, so <em>by the obedience of one shall many be made righteous</em>.</p>

<p>Being justified freely by his grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus: Whom God hath set forth to be a propitiation through faith in his blood, <em>to declare his righteousness for the remission of sins</em> that are past, through the forbearance of God.</p>
</blockquote><figcaption>— Romans 3:24-25</figcaption></figure><p>Christ’s perfect life gives us the ability to be free from the bondage of sin and it’s penalty of death! By paying for our sins, Jesus made it possible for anyone who receives this free gift by faith through repentance of sins to be forgiven and declared righteous before God!</p></section>

And God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes; and there shall be <em>no more death, neither sorrow, nor crying, neither shall there be any more pain: for the former things are passed away</em>.
