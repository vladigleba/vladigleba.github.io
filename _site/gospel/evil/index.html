He was also a covering cherub, which means he had a high position in heaven and was next to God’s very presence. It’s unknown how long perfection existed in heaven, but eventually evil was born in Lucifer’s heart because he aall of God’s angels had freedom of choice. This is a risk God willingly took because genuine love cannot exist without a free will.</p></section>

And to every beast of the earth, and to every fowl of the air, and to every thing that creepeth upon the earth, wherein there is life, I have given every green herb for meat: and it was so.

And the serpent said unto the woman, Ye shall not surely die: For God doth know that in the day ye eat thereof, then <em>your eyes shall be opened, and ye shall be as gods, knowing good and evil</em>.</p>
</blockquote><figcaption>— Genesis 3:1-5</figcaption></figure><p>Satan used a serpent to deceive Eve and contradict God by telling her that not only would she not die if she ate the fruit, but she would also become like God, which is exactly what Satan himself desired in heaven. The implication was that God was holding her back from reaching her fullest potential, and Satan was actually the one who had her best interests in mind, not God.</p></section>

And <em>the eyes of them both were opened, and they knew that they were naked</em>; and they sewed fig leaves together, and made themselves aprons.</p>
</blockquote><figcaption>— Genesis 3:6-7</figcaption></figure><p>In order to deceive Eve, Satan mixed in some truth with his lie when he said she would know good and evil because now that they had sinned against God, Adam and Eve lost their innocence, and their eyes were indeed opened to shame, grief, suffering, pain, and death, but they did not ascend to a higher state of existence, as Satan had promised. It was not God’s will for them to know evil, but because Adam and Eve had chosen to believe Satan’s version of reality, he was now free to proceed with establishing his form of government on Earth.</p></section>
