It is no different with the King of the universe and His government, except His law is eternal, true, upright, perfect, sure, right, and pure. God’s dominion knows no bounds, and His law, therefore, is universal as well, so even though it’s mostly neglected on earth, it is still binding.</p></section>

<p>Let us hear the conclusion of the whole matter: <em>fear God, and keep his commandments: for this is the whole duty of man</em>.</p>
</blockquote><figcaption>— Ecclesiastes 12:13</figcaption></figure><p>Satan rebelled against God’s law in heaven because he didn’t want to be restricted by it, and when Adam and Even believed his lie about defining good and evil for themselves (<a href="https://bible-api.com/Genesis%203%3A5?translation=kjv" class="verse-link" data-reference="Genesis 3:5" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Genesis 3:5</a>), his lawless kingdom took over earth as well. Our Creator God defines good and evil for us in His law because He knows what’s best for us better than we will ever know ourselves. And His law is not a restriction; it’s there to be a blessing, to protect us from evils, such as murder, adultery, theft, and falsehood, ensuring a happy and harmonious existence for all.</p></section>

<p>If ye fulfil the royal law according to the scripture, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself, ye do well: But if ye have respect to persons, ye commit sin, and are convinced of the law as transgressors. <em>For whosoever shall keep the whole law, and yet offend in one point, he is guilty of all</em>. For he that said, Do not commit adultery, said also, Do not kill. Now if thou commit no adultery, yet if thou kill, <em>thou art become a transgressor of the law</em>. So speak ye, and so do, as they that shall be judged by the law of liberty.</p>
</blockquote><figcaption>— James 2:8-12</figcaption></figure><figure><blockquote>
<p>For as many as are of the works of the law are under the curse: for it is written, <em>Cursed is every one that continueth not in all things which are written in the book of the law to do them</em>.</p>

<p>But we are all as an unclean thing, and <em>all our righteousnesses are as filthy rags</em>; and we all do fade as a leaf; and our iniquities, like the wind, have taken us away.</p>
</blockquote><figcaption>— Isaiah 64:6</figcaption></figure><p>When James is talking about the law, he is referring to the Ten Commandments, and he actually says it’s not enough to keep some or even most of them. Breaking even one is breaking them all. Consequently, there is no human being who hasn’t been condemned by the law, which is the standard during <a href="/prophecy/judgment/">the judgment</a>.</p></section>

<p>Being justified freely by his grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus: whom God hath set forth to be a propitiation through faith in his blood, to declare his righteousness for the remission of sins that are past, through the forbearance of God; to declare, I say, at this time his righteousness: that he might be just, and the justifier of him which believeth in Jesus. Where is boasting then? It is excluded. By what law? of works? Nay: but by the law of faith. Therefore we conclude that a <em>man is justified by faith without the deeds of the law</em>.</p>
</blockquote><figcaption>— Romans 3:24-28</figcaption></figure><p>Because Jesus is the Creator God, He was able to take the condemnation of the law on Himself at the cross, on behalf of all humanity, so that every person who accepts Him by faith in His substitutionary sacrifice could stand before the law clothed in His perfectly righteous life!</p></section>

Yes, of the Gentiles also: seeing it is one God, which shall justify the circumcision by faith, and uncircumcision through faith. <em>Do we then make void the law through faith? God forbid: yea, we establish the law</em>.</p>

</blockquote><figcaption>— Matthew 5:17-18</figcaption></figure><p>If you were caught speeding and the police officer wanted to give you a hefty fine, but decided to give you a warning instead, would you then go screeching out back on the highway to break the speed limit again? No, you would carefully watch your speed. Jesus’ death on the cross was an act of mercy and forgiveness for those who accept it, not a license to live lawlessly.</p></section>

<p>For <em>this is the love of God, that we keep his commandments</em>: and his commandments are not grievous.</p>
</blockquote><figcaption>— 1 John 5:3</figcaption></figure><figure><blockquote>
<p>Then one of them, which was a lawyer, asked him a question, tempting him, and saying, Master, which is the great commandment in the law? Jesus said unto him, <em>Thou shalt love the Lord thy God</em> with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind. This is the first and great commandment. And the second is like unto it, <em>Thou shalt love thy neighbour</em> as thyself. <em>On these two commandments hang all the law</em> and the prophets.</p>
</blockquote><figcaption>— Matthew 22:35-40</figcaption></figure><figure><blockquote>
<p>Love worketh no ill to his neighbour: therefore <em>love is the fulfilling of the law</em>.</p>
</blockquote><figcaption>— Romans 13:10</figcaption></figure><p>Since selfishness is at the root of sin, and sin is the breaking of His law, then the law is really a law of love, dealing with my relationship with God (the first four commandments) and my neighbor (the last six). That’s why Jesus said that the entire law hangs on loving God and loving my neighbor. When there is genuine love present in a relationship then pleasing that person ceases to become a burden; in fact, without love for Jesus it’s not possible to keep His law.</p></section>

Christ works in me when I surrender fully to Him—when I choose daily to die to self and pray, “Not my will, but Yours be done” (<a href="https://bible-api.com/Matthew%2026%3A39?translation=kjv" class="verse-link" data-reference="Matthew 26:39" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Matthew 26:39</a>).</p></section>

<p>Not every one that saith unto me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of heaven; but <em>he that doeth the will of my Father which is in heaven</em>. Many will say to me in that day, Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied in thy name? and in thy name have cast out devils? and in thy name done many wonderful works? And then will I profess unto them, <em>I never knew you: depart from me, ye that work iniquity</em>.</p>
</blockquote><figcaption>— Matthew 7:21-23</figcaption></figure><figure><blockquote>
<p>The <em>heart is deceitful above all things</em>, and desperately wicked: who can know it? <em>I the LORD search the heart</em>, I try the reins, even to give every man according to his ways, and according to the fruit of his doings.</p>
</blockquote><figcaption>— Jeremiah 17:9-10</figcaption></figure><figure><blockquote>
<p>O LORD, <em>thou hast searched me, and known me</em>. Thou knowest my downsitting and mine uprising, thou understandest my thought afar off. Thou compassest my path and my lying down, and <em>art acquainted with all my ways</em>. For there is not a word in my tongue, but, lo, O LORD, thou knowest it altogether.</p>
</blockquote><figcaption>— Psalm 139:1-4</figcaption></figure><p>God knows me better than I know myself, and He knows if I truly love Him. The Ten Commandments are really a mirror that shows my genuine condition; they provide evidence letting me know if I truly love Him because it can be easy to deceive myself. Jesus says there will be people who served Him and thought they loved Him, but their lawlessness will say otherwise.</p></section>

<p>Then will I sprinkle clean water upon you, and ye shall be clean: from all your filthiness, and from all your idols, will I cleanse you. A new heart also will I give you, and a new spirit will I put within you: and I will take away the stony heart out of your flesh, and I will give you an heart of flesh. <em>And I will put my spirit within you, and cause you to walk in my statutes, and ye shall keep my judgments, and do them</em>.</p>

</blockquote><figcaption>— Psalm 40:8</figcaption></figure><p>God promises to help me keep His commandments because He knows that I cannot overcome sin myself. But He does not force Himself on anyone, so I must ask, and the promise is He will write His law in my heart and mind, enabling me to walk in His commandments through the power of the Holy Spirit dwelling in me! The only one who can create a new heart in me is the One who created the world in Eden. If I take Him at His word, believing that He will keep this promise, He will do it according to my faith (<a href="https://bible-api.com/Matthew%209%3A29?translation=kjv" class="verse-link" data-reference="Matthew 9:29" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Matthew 9:29</a>), making it a delight for me to do His will (<a href="https://bible-api.com/Psalm%2040%3A8?translation=kjv" class="verse-link" data-reference="Psalm 40:8" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Psalm 40:8</a>)!</p></section>
