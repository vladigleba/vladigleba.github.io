Our Creator God defines good and evil for us in His law because He knows what’s best for us better than we will ever know ourselves. And His law is not a restriction; it’s there to be a blessing, to protect us from evils, such as murder, adultery, theft, and falsehood, ensuring a happy and harmonious existence for all.</p></section>

For he that said, Do not commit adultery, said also, Do not kill. Now if thou commit no adultery, yet if thou kill, <em>thou art become a transgressor of the law</em>.

<p>Then one of them, which was a lawyer, asked him a question, tempting him, and saying, Master, which is the great commandment in the law?

<p>Love worketh no ill to his neighbour: therefore <em>love is the fulfilling of the law</em>.</p>
</blockquote><figcaption>— Romans 13:10</figcaption></figure><p data-search-id="paragraph-6">Since selfishness is at the root of sin, and sin is the breaking of His law, then the law is really a law of love, dealing with my relationship with God (the first four commandments) and my neighbor (the last six). That’s why Jesus said that the entire law hangs on loving God and loving my neighbor. When there is genuine love present in a relationship then pleasing that person ceases to become a burden; in fact, without love for Jesus it’s not possible to keep His law.</p></section>
