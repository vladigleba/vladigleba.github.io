<p>And let them make me a sanctuary; <em>that I may dwell among them</em>.</p>
</blockquote><figcaption>— Exodus 25:8</figcaption></figure><p>The sanctuary was built so that God could dwell among His people. When Adam and Eve sinned, they lost the closeness they had with their Creator because sin separates us from Him (<a href="https://bible-api.com/Isaiah%2059%3A1-2?translation=kjv" class="verse-link" data-reference="Isaiah 59:1-2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Isaiah 59:1-2</a>). Our Creator God is holy, and He cannot dwell in the presence of sin because His holiness is a consuming fire to sin and anyone who cherishes it (<a href="https://bible-api.com/Deuteronomy%204%3A24?translation=kjv" class="verse-link" data-reference="Deuteronomy 4:24" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Deuteronomy 4:24</a>). In order to remove this barrier created by sin, God told Moses to build a sanctuary so He could again live with His people. His permanent presence in the sanctuary would be a source of comfort to the Israelites as He guided, protected, and provided for them in their journey through life.</p></section>

<p><em>Thy way</em>, O God, is in the sanctuary: who is so great a God as our God?</p>

<p>And almost all things are by the law purged with blood; and <em>without shedding of blood is no remission</em>.</p>
</blockquote><figcaption>— Hebrews 9:22</figcaption></figure><figure><blockquote>
<p>For <em>the life of the flesh is in the blood</em>: and I have given it to you upon the altar to make an atonement for your souls: for <em>it is the blood that maketh an atonement for the soul</em>.</p>
</blockquote><figcaption>— Leviticus 17:11</figcaption></figure><p>The sanctuary service revolved around the sacrifice of animals, and this taught that blood, a symbol of life, had to be shed to obtain forgiveness of sin. But it wasn’t the blood of the sacrificed animals that provided forgiveness: theirs was merely a symbol that pointed to the only blood that could—the blood, and life, of the One who was sinned against. Jesus, the Creator of heaven and earth, is the Lamb of God slain from the foundation of the world (<a href="https://bible-api.com/Revelation%2013%3A8?translation=kjv" class="verse-link" data-reference="Revelation 13:8" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Revelation 13:8</a>) who takes away my sins (<a href="https://bible-api.com/John%201%3A29?translation=kjv" class="verse-link" data-reference="John 1:29" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">John 1:29</a>). The sanctuary thus provides a vivid portrayal of the high price of sin. It may seem insignificant to us, but sin ended up costing the very life Jesus, and if it wasn’t for His death on our behalf, it would’ve cost us our lives. Satan makes it look attractive, perhaps even life-giving at times, but the truth is sin always takes life away, while bringing pain, suffering, and, ultimately, death (<a href="https://bible-api.com/Romans%206%3A23?translation=kjv" class="verse-link" data-reference="Romans 6:23" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Romans 6:23</a>).</p></section>

<p><em>According to all that I shew thee</em>, after the pattern of the tabernacle, and the pattern of all the instruments thereof, even so shall ye make it.</p>
</blockquote><figcaption>— Exodus 25:9</figcaption></figure><p>The blueprint for the sanctuary came from God Himself because, through it, He wanted to teach important lessons about the plan of salvation. Originally it was a portable, tent-like structure made of acacia wood, goat hair, animal skins, silver, and gold, consisting of three areas: the courtyard, the Holy Place, and the Most Holy Place.</p><p>The courtyard, the area around the sanctuary, was 75 feet by 150 feet (<a href="https://bible-api.com/Exodus%2027%3A18?translation=kjv" class="verse-link" data-reference="Exodus 27:18" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Exodus 27:18</a>) and fenced with linen cloth attached to 60 evenly spaced pillars of brass (<a href="https://bible-api.com/Exodus%2027%3A9-16?translation=kjv" class="verse-link" data-reference="Exodus 27:9-16" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Exodus 27:9-16</a>). This perimiter had only one opening through which the sinner would enter the courtyard. Upon entry, the sinner would walk toward the altar of burnt offering (<a href="https://bible-api.com/Exodus%2040%3A6?translation=kjv" class="verse-link" data-reference="Exodus 40:6" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Exodus 40:6</a>), where his or her animal sacrifice would be consumed by fire. Past the altar, but before the sanctuary entrance, was a laver (basin) for the priests to wash their hands and feet.</p><p>The sanctuary itself was made up of two rooms, the Holy Place and the Most Holy Place, and the two were separated by a thick veil (curtain). The sanctuary walls were made of wooden boards overlaid in gold and set in silver sockets (<a href="https://bible-api.com/Exodus%2026%3A15-19%2C%2029?translation=kjv" class="verse-link" data-reference="Exodus 26:15-19, 29" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Exodus 26:15-19, 29</a>), while the roof consisted of four coverings: linen, goat hair, ram skin, and badger skin (<a href="https://bible-api.com/Exodus%2026%3A1%2C%207-14?translation=kjv" class="verse-link" data-reference="Exodus 26:1, 7-14" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Exodus 26:1, 7-14</a>). Upon entry into the sanctuary, the first room was the Holy Place, containing a seven-branched candlestick that was kept burning at all times (<a href="https://bible-api.com/Exodus%2025%3A31-40?translation=kjv" class="verse-link" data-reference="Exodus 25:31-40" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Exodus 25:31-40</a>), an altar of incense that was also kept consistently burning (<a href="https://bible-api.com/Exodus%2030%3A7-8?translation=kjv" class="verse-link" data-reference="Exodus 30:7-8" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Exodus 30:7-8</a>), and a table of showbread with loaves of bread on it (<a href="https://bible-api.com/Exodus%2025%3A30?translation=kjv" class="verse-link" data-reference="Exodus 25:30" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Exodus 25:30</a>; <a href="https://bible-api.com/Leviticus%2024%3A5-9?translation=kjv" class="verse-link" data-reference="Leviticus 24:5-9" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Leviticus 24:5-9</a>). Past the thick veil was the Most Holy Place, the room where the presence of God resided. It contained the Ark of the Covenant (<a href="https://bible-api.com/Exodus%2040%3A3?translation=kjv" class="verse-link" data-reference="Exodus 40:3" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Exodus 40:3</a>), which had the mercy seat on top of it and two angels, made of pure gold, on top of the mercy seat (<a href="https://bible-api.com/Exodus%2025%3A17-22?translation=kjv" class="verse-link" data-reference="Exodus 25:17-22" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Exodus 25:17-22</a>). Inside the ark were the Ten Commandments written with the finger of God (<a href="https://bible-api.com/Deuteronomy%2010%3A4-5?translation=kjv" class="verse-link" data-reference="Deuteronomy 10:4-5" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Deuteronomy 10:4-5</a>).</p></section>

<p>Now this is the main point of the things we are saying: We have such a High Priest, who is seated at the right hand of the throne of the Majesty in the heavens, a Minister <em>of the sanctuary and of the true tabernacle which the Lord erected, and not man</em>. For every high priest is appointed to offer both gifts and sacrifices. Therefore it is necessary that this One also have something to offer. For if He were on earth, He would not be a priest, since there are priests who offer the gifts according to the law; <em>who serve the copy and shadow of the heavenly things</em>, as Moses was divinely instructed when he was about to make the tabernacle. For He said, “See that you make all things according to the pattern shown you on the mountain.”</p>
</blockquote><figcaption>— Hebrews 8:1-5</figcaption></figure><p>The Hebrew sanctuary was a copy, a “shadow,” of the sanctuary in heaven of which Jesus is the High Priest, offering forgiveness of sins to the repenting sinner. In other words, God’s true sanctuary is the heavenly one, not the earthly one.</p></section>

<p>And he shall lay his hand upon the head of the sin offering, and <em>slay it for a sin offering</em> in the place where they kill the burnt offering.</p>
</blockquote><figcaption>— Leviticus 4:33</figcaption></figure><p>A sinner would walk into the courtyard with a sacrificial lamb and approach the altar of burnt offering. Then he would confess his sins onto the lamb by placing his hand on its head (<a href="https://bible-api.com/Leviticus%204%3A29?translation=kjv" class="verse-link" data-reference="Leviticus 4:29" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Leviticus 4:29</a>; <a href="https://bible-api.com/Leviticus%205%3A5?translation=kjv" class="verse-link" data-reference="Leviticus 5:5" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">5:5</a>), symbolically transferring his sins to the lamb. Because the lamb was now symbolically guilty, it had to pay the penalty of sin—death, and the sinner would then slay the lamb with his own hand. Obviously, this was not an easy process, but it was intended to show the seriousness of sin. Afterward, the priest either ate part of the animal sacrifice (<a href="https://bible-api.com/Leviticus%206%3A26?translation=kjv" class="verse-link" data-reference="Leviticus 6:26" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Leviticus 6:26</a>) or sprinkled some of its blood inside the sanctuary (<a href="https://bible-api.com/Leviticus%204%3A16-17?translation=kjv" class="verse-link" data-reference="Leviticus 4:16-17" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Leviticus 4:16-17</a>), depending on the sacrifice offered. This meant the sin was then transferred from the lamb to the priest and then into the sanctuary, and the sinner walked away free from the penalty of sin.</p></section>

While the Hebrews were forgiven by looking forward, in faith, to the future sacrifice of Jesus, I am forgiven by looking backward, in faith, to what is now a completed sacrifice on the cross on my behalf. When Jesus died, the veil separating the Holy Place from the Most Holy Place in the earthly sanctuary was torn from top to bottom (<a href="https://bible-api.com/Matthew%2027%3A51?translation=kjv" class="verse-link" data-reference="Matthew 27:51" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Matthew 27:51</a>), a divine indication that its services were obsolete from that moment on because the One true and great sacrifice they were all pointing to had been accomplished (<a href="https://bible-api.com/Daniel%209%3A27?translation=kjv" class="verse-link" data-reference="Daniel 9:27" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Daniel 9:27</a>).

Because God’s Ten Commandments were inside the ark, it shows how His <a href="/gospel/law/">law of love</a>, which is a reflection of His character, is the foundation of His government. But since the mercy seat was over the Ten Commandments, it also represents His mercy being extended, through the blood that was sprinkled on the seat by the priest (<a href="https://bible-api.com/Leviticus%2016%3A15-16?translation=kjv" class="verse-link" data-reference="Leviticus 16:15-16" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Leviticus 16:15-16</a>), to those who confess and forsake sin after breaking His law. It’s beautiful! And of course, the sprinkled blood was a symbol of Jesus’ blood shed on behalf of all people (<a href="https://bible-api.com/Matthew%2026%3A28?translation=kjv" class="verse-link" data-reference="Matthew 26:28" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Matthew 26:28</a>).</li>

During this day the sanctuary was cleansed from the sins that had been trasferred there throughout the year because as the people offered sacrifices for sin, their sin was then symbolically transferred to the lamb, from the lamb to the priest, and, finally, from the priest to the sanctuary itself.</p></section>

This represented the blood of Jesus and the mercy of God available to anyone who chooses to confess and forsake sin. God accepted the sprinkled blood, and the confessed sins of the people were then transferred from the sanctuary to the high priest, who then transferred them to the second goat—the scapegoat, which represented Satan (<a href="https://bible-api.com/Leviticus%2016%3A8?translation=kjv" class="verse-link" data-reference="Leviticus 16:8" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Leviticus 16:8</a>).

Then and only then will the atonement be completed and the universe restored to its pre-sin state.

</blockquote><figcaption>— Hebrews 4:15-16</figcaption></figure><p>Because Jesus was born in human flesh, He experienced all of the temptations that we experience, and because He knows what it feels like to wrestle with sin, He is full of mercy and compassion toward anyone who comes to Him in confession and repentence.

The human race brought it into the world, and the sanctuary shows that God takes it very seriously. His justice cannot excuse it, but, in His mercy, He also takes the burden of providing a way out of it entirely upon Himself, and He gives the remedy—freely—to anyone willing to take it. He is our merciful High Priest who shed His own blood so our record of sin could be blotted out. The only question is have you accepted His offer of mercy? Have your sins been covered by the blood of the Lamb?</p></section>
