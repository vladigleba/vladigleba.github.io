<p>For <em>by grace</em> are ye saved <em>through faith</em>; and that not of yourselves: <em>it is the gift of God</em>. Not of works, lest any man should boast.</p>
</blockquote><figcaption>— Ephesians 2:8-9</figcaption></figure><figure><blockquote>
<p>Therefore we conclude that a man is <em>justified by faith without the deeds of the law</em>.</p>

<p>Therefore being <em>justified by faith</em>, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ: by whom also we <em>have access by faith into this grace</em> wherein we stand, and rejoice in hope of the glory of God.</p>

<p>But that no man is justified by the law in the sight of God, it is evident: for, <em>The just shall live by faith</em>.</p>
</blockquote><figcaption>— Galatians 3:11</figcaption></figure><p>There is nothing I can do to earn salvation; it is a free gift that I receive by grace through faith in His love, His forgiveness, and His victory on the cross. The Protestant Reformation brought this marvelous truth to light after centuries of a counterfeit method of salvation focused on works. Sadly, however, Protestantism has begun to drift away from its original position.</p><p>In 1999, the Catholic and Lutheran churches issued a <em>Joint Declaration on the Doctrine of Justification</em>, which includes this key statement: “By grace alone, in faith in Christ’s saving work and not because of any merit on our part, we are accepted by God …” Note that “by grace alone” is not the same as “by faith alone.” While it is true that we are saved by grace, that grace is appropriated by faith—without faith, there can be no grace. The joint statement elevates grace over faith, while the Bible emphasizes faith. This difference may not seem significant at first, but it becomes critical when viewed through the lens of Catholic teaching, which holds that the Church is the dispenser of grace from the treasury of merit, which includes not only Christ’s good works but also those of Mary and the saints.</p></section>

</blockquote><figcaption>— Romans 3:25</figcaption></figure><p>The Bible is clear that it is not Christ’s works that save me, but His shed blood. In the <em>Joint Declaration</em>, the phrase “faith in Christ’s saving work” refers to the treasury of merit, which the Church dispenses to atone for sin; however, the Bible teaches that without the shedding of <em>blood</em> there is no remission of sin. The truth is Christ died for each person individually (<a href="https://bible-api.com/Galatians%202%3A20?translation=kjv" class="verse-link" data-reference="Galatians 2:20" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Galatians 2:20</a>). His death paid the penalty for my sins—the penalty that I was supposed to pay—while His righteous life satisfies the claims of the law upon me, namely, perfect righteousness, which my life could never meet (<a href="https://bible-api.com/Romans%205%3A9-10?translation=kjv" class="verse-link" data-reference="Romans 5:9-10" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Romans 5:9-10</a>).</p></section>

<p>Behold, I stand at the door, and knock: <em>if any man hear my voice, and open the door</em>, I will come in to him, and will sup with him, and he with me.</p>
</blockquote><figcaption>— Revelation 3:20</figcaption></figure><p>God’s way of salvation has always been about respecting freedom of choice. He gave Satan the option to rebel, and He did not immediately destroy him when he did. God permitted Adam and Eve to rebel too. Likewise, I am free to choose whether I want to serve Him or not. Jesus wants to save every person (<a href="https://bible-api.com/1%20Timothy%202%3A3-4?translation=kjv" class="verse-link" data-reference="1 Timothy 2:3-4" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">1 Timothy 2:3-4</a>)—He wants me to choose Him—but He will not force Himself on anyone. In fact, this is a daily choice; I can choose, anytime, to leave Christ and go in another direction, which is why it’s imperative to reaffirm my decision and recommit myself to Him on a daily basis (<a href="https://bible-api.com/Luke%209%3A23?translation=kjv" class="verse-link" data-reference="Luke 9:23" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Luke 9:23</a>). Every single day is a gift from my Creator, and it’s my privilege to give it back to Him.</p></section>

<p>But grow in grace, and in the knowledge of <em>our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ</em>. To him be glory both now and for ever. Amen.</p>
</blockquote><figcaption>— 2 Peter 3:18</figcaption></figure><p>Both are a fundamental aspect of salvation, but there is a difference between the two. Accepting Jesus as Savior means being saved from the penalty of sin (death) because He offers forgiveness for every sin that I’ve genuinely confessed and decided to forsake. Once forgiven, He credits me with His own righteousness so that my imperfect life is covered by His perfect life.</p><p>Accepting Jesus as Lord, on the other hand, means surrendering my will to Him, thereby making Him the ruler of my life. This is a decision that takes place daily (<a href="https://bible-api.com/Luke%209%3A23?translation=kjv" class="verse-link" data-reference="Luke 9:23" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Luke 9:23</a>) because our natural desire is to do and live as we please, but the Bible calls this way of life sin (<a href="https://bible-api.com/Isaiah%2053%3A6?translation=kjv" class="verse-link" data-reference="Isaiah 53:6" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Isaiah 53:6</a>) because our human nature, by default, is contrary to the law of God (<a href="https://bible-api.com/Romans%208%3A7?translation=kjv" class="verse-link" data-reference="Romans 8:7" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Romans 8:7</a>). The truth is God knows what is best for us better than we know ourselves, and He wants us to trust Him enough to allow Him to rule our lives, which, in turn, gives Him permission to mold us into Him image (<a href="https://bible-api.com/Ephesians%204%3A13?translation=kjv" class="verse-link" data-reference="Ephesians 4:13" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ephesians 4:13</a>). This surrender is crucial, because without it He does not have the right to transform our characters to reflect the beauty of His character.</p></section>
