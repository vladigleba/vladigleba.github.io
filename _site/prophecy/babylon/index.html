<p>And they said, Go to, let us build us a city and a tower, whose top may reach unto heaven; and let us make us a name, lest we be scattered abroad upon the face of the whole earth. And the LORD came down to see the city and the tower, which the children of men builded. And the LORD said, Behold, the people is one, and they have all one language; and this they begin to do: and now nothing will be restrained from them, which they have imagined to do. Go to, let us go down, and there confound their language, that they may not understand one another’s speech. So the LORD scattered them abroad from thence upon the face of all the earth: and they left off to build the city. <em>Therefore is the name of it called Babel; because the LORD did there confound the language of all the earth</em>: and from thence did the LORD scatter them abroad upon the face of all the earth.</p>

<p>The king spake, and said, <em>Is not this great Babylon, that I have built</em> for the house of the kingdom <em>by the might of my power, and for the honour of my majesty</em>?</p>
</blockquote><figcaption>— Daniel 4:30</figcaption></figure><p>The word “Babylon” originated at the Tower of Babel because it was the place where God confounded language, leading to confusion and bringing construction to a halt. “Babylon” and “Babel” both mean “confusion.” Later on in the 600s BC, the pagan kingdom of <a href="/prophecy/europe/">Babylon arose</a> and developed into an economic and religious center of the world. Its religion was characterized by idolatry, ancestor worship, and sun worship, and it became an enemy of God’s people, Israel (<a href="https://bible-api.com/Jeremiah%2039%3A6-7?translation=kjv" class="verse-link" data-reference="Jeremiah 39:6-7" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Jeremiah 39:6-7</a>; <a href="https://bible-api.com/Jeremiah%2050%3A29-34?translation=kjv" class="verse-link" data-reference="Jeremiah 50:29-34" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">50:29-34</a>; <a href="https://bible-api.com/Jeremiah%2051%3A34?translation=kjv" class="verse-link" data-reference="Jeremiah 51:34" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">51:34</a>). Babylon was also marked by a boastful and prideful spirit, as seen in the Babylonian king’s boastful remark in <a href="https://bible-api.com/Daniel%204%3A30?translation=kjv" class="verse-link" data-reference="Daniel 4:30" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Daniel 4:30</a>. In fact, in <a href="https://bible-api.com/Isaiah%2014%3A4-22?translation=kjv" class="verse-link" data-reference="Isaiah 14:4-22" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Isaiah 14:4-22</a>, God uses Babylon as a symbol of Satan due to its pride and wickedness.</p></section>

<p>Babylon hath been a golden cup in the LORD’s hand, that made all the earth drunken: <em>the nations have drunken of her wine; therefore the nations are mad</em>. Babylon is suddenly fallen and destroyed: howl for her; take balm for her pain, if so be she may be healed.</p>

<p>Then they <em>brought the golden vessels that were taken out of the temple of the house of God which was at Jerusalem; and the king, and his princes, his wives, and his concubines, drank in them</em>. They drank wine, and praised the gods of gold, and of silver, of brass, of iron, of wood, and of stone.</p>
</blockquote><figcaption>— Daniel 5:3-4</figcaption></figure><p>Because of its power and influence in the world, Babylon made drunk, or confused, the nations of the world with its false pagan teachings, and due to its refusal to turn from its wickedness, idolatry, and persecution of God’s people, God allowed it to be destroyed (<a href="https://bible-api.com/Daniel%204%3A30?translation=kjv" class="verse-link" data-reference="Daniel 4:30" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Daniel 4:30</a>; <a href="https://bible-api.com/Jeremiah%2051%3A24%2C%2047?translation=kjv" class="verse-link" data-reference="Jeremiah 51:24, 47" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Jeremiah 51:24, 47</a>) by the Medo-Persians. On the night of its fall, the king of Babylon threw a party, during which he desecrated the holy vessels stolen from the temple of God in Jerusalem by drinking wine out of them and using them for the unholy worship of false gods. He ended up perishing that very night (<a href="https://bible-api.com/Daniel%205%3A30?translation=kjv" class="verse-link" data-reference="Daniel 5:30" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Daniel 5:30</a>).

        </svg></a></h2><p>The Bible gives seven characteristics to identify the harlot of Revelation 17 as the papacy. Now it’s important to emphasize that this is not a condemnation of Roman Catholics; rather, the Bible is pointing out a system—Catholicism. In other places the Bible also points out the faults of the Jewish and Protestant faiths. Moreover, God has devoted Christians in all churches, including the Roman Catholic church. It is also true that the papacy has done many good deeds for the poor and the needy, but she has also committed serious errors that the Bible clearly points out in Daniel and in Revelation. God must sometimes chasten and rebuke because He wants us to be aware of error and compromise, and people who are truly loyal to Him will heed His warnings, no matter the faith. With this in mind, let’s examine each of the seven characteristics.</p><ol>
<li>
<p><em>She is called the “Mother of Harlots.”</em> There is only one church that calls itself the mother church—the Roman Catholic Church. A prominent Catholic priest has made the following point: “They [non-Catholics] have continued the custom [of Sunday-keeping], even though it rests upon the authority of the Catholic Church and not upon an explicit text in the Bible. That observance [Sunday-keeping] remains as a reminder of the Mother Church from which the non-Catholic sects broke away—like a boy running away from home but still carrying in his pocket a picture of his mother or a lock of her hair.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">[1]</a></sup></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>She persecutes the saints.</em> The papacy persecuted and killed millions of people during the Dark Ages for following their conscience.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>She is dressed in purple and scarlet and decked with jewelry.</em> The colors listed match those of papal vestments. Red is the robe color worn by Catholic cardinals, and purple is the color of royalty, often worn by the pope at significant events since he is considered to be Christ’s representative on earth. <a href="https://bible-api.com/Revelation%2018%3A7?translation=kjv" class="verse-link" data-reference="Revelation 18:7" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Revelation 18:7</a> confirms this when it says that Babylon considers herself a queen. She is also decked with gold, precious stones, and pearls, all of which point to great wealth, which can be seen in her ornate and extravagant cathedrals. The golden cup in her hand looks impressive on the outside, but the inside is full of abominations—or false teachings based on human tradition, which is elevated above the Bible.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>She is sitting on a beast.</em> A beast represents a kingdom or nation (<a href="https://bible-api.com/Daniel%207%3A23?translation=kjv" class="verse-link" data-reference="Daniel 7:23" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Daniel 7:23</a>), so the fact that she is sitting on the beast represents not just the union of church and state (though they remain separate entities), but power over the state and its policies. This was fulfilled in the Dark Ages when the papacy united with, and exercised power over, the state to implement her policies and persecute people who disagreed with her teachings. This will be <a href="/prophecy/usa/">repeated again</a> in the last days.</p>
</li>
<li>

</blockquote><figcaption>— John 14:6</figcaption></figure><p>Just as the harlot represents a fallen church, her daughters also represent fallen churches. Since the mother, just like ancient Babylon, has confused the world with her teachings, these daughter churches follow and teach the same key errors as the mother church. No woman, however, is born a harlot. These harlot daughters were originally undefiled and separate from the mother when during the great Protestant Reformation they protested her unbiblical teachings, but slowly, over time, they began to come back to her in acknowledgment of her authority and in agreement with her key teachings. This has led to them becoming fallen themselves and a part of spiritual Babylon. Peter uses the word “fallen” as another term to describe a turning away from truth and choosing to be led by error instead. He contrasts this with growing in grace and the knowledge of Jesus, which means that, ultimately, a fallen church turns her back on Jesus Himself because He is the truth.</p></section>

We’ve already seen how the papacy united with the state in the Dark Ages to persecute, torture, and kill millions of people. God prohibits such a union because He never uses coercive measures to draw people to Himself; instead, He respectfully knocks at the door of the heart (<a href="https://bible-api.com/Revelation%203%3A20?translation=kjv" class="verse-link" data-reference="Revelation 3:20" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Revelation 3:20</a>) because He respects freedom of choice and wants people to follow Him out of love. He does not need the state to help bring people into His church; His love alone is powerful enough! The true church is loyal to Jesus only, but the papacy has turned away from her husband, Jesus, and formed illicit relationships with the state instead.</p></section>

<p>And the <em>times of this ignorance God winked at</em>; but now commandeth all men every where to repent.</p>
</blockquote><figcaption>— Acts 17:30</figcaption></figure><p>Absolutely not. This is made clear in God’s call to “Come out of her, my people,” meaning there are sincere people in Babylon whom God calls His children. Not knowing certain Bible teachings does not mean a person is lost or not a child of God as He does not hold me accountable for truths I don’t know, but once I know the truth, God calls me out of error to stand on the Bible alone.</p></section>

<p>And I heard another voice from heaven, saying, Come out of her, my people, <em>that ye be not partakers of her sins, and that ye receive not of her plagues</em>. … Therefore shall her plagues come in one day, death, and mourning, and famine; and <em>she shall be utterly burned with fire</em>: for strong is the Lord God who judgeth her.</p>
</blockquote><figcaption>— Revelation 18:4, 8</figcaption></figure><figure><blockquote>
<p>Whosoever committeth sin transgresseth also the law: for <em>sin is the transgression of the law</em>.</p>
</blockquote><figcaption>— 1 John 3:4</figcaption></figure><p>Babylon has become hopelessly drunk with her false doctrines and traditions, which have resulted in her sinning against God (breaking His law), and Jesus says she’s going to be destroyed, not reformed. There may be pressure from other people to stay in Babylon, but remaining in a system that teaches errors is spiritually dangerous; ultimately, it’s Jesus’ opinion that matters most. When Paul was under immense pressure from religious leaders to compromise with error, He answered, “We ought to obey God rather than men” (<a href="https://bible-api.com/Acts%205%3A29?translation=kjv" class="verse-link" data-reference="Acts 5:29" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Acts 5:29</a>). Though it may seem difficult, it’s the right thing to do. If this is you, ask God for guidance as you seek His will and search the Scriptures (<a href="https://bible-api.com/Acts%2017%3A11?translation=kjv" class="verse-link" data-reference="Acts 17:11" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Acts 17:11</a>). Promise Him that you will follow wherever He leads, and His promise to you is He will lead you to the truth (<a href="https://bible-api.com/John%207%3A17?translation=kjv" class="verse-link" data-reference="John 7:17" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">John 7:17</a>), which will set you free (<a href="https://bible-api.com/John%2017%3A17?translation=kjv" class="verse-link" data-reference="John 17:17" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">John 17:17</a>). When Jesus has your heart, He will give all the grace you need to follow Him (<a href="https://bible-api.com/Philippians%204%3A13?translation=kjv" class="verse-link" data-reference="Philippians 4:13" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Philippians 4:13</a>).</p><hr class="footnotes-sep"><section class="footnotes">
