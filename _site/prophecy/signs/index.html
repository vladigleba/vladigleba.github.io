<figure><blockquote>
<p>And as he sat upon the mount of Olives, the disciples came unto him privately, saying, Tell us, when shall these things be? and what shall be the sign of thy coming, and of the end of the world? And Jesus answered and said unto them, <em>Take heed that no man deceive you. For many shall come in my name, saying, I am Christ; and shall deceive many</em>.</p>
</blockquote><figcaption>— Matthew 24:3-5</figcaption></figure>

<figure><blockquote>
<p>For there <em>shall arise false Christs, and false prophets, and shall shew great signs and wonders</em>; insomuch that, if it were possible, they shall deceive the very elect.</p>
</blockquote><figcaption>— Matthew 24:24</figcaption></figure>

<figure><blockquote>
<p>For such are false apostles, deceitful workers, transforming themselves into the apostles of Christ. And no marvel; for <em>Satan himself is transformed into an angel of light</em>.</p>
</blockquote><figcaption>— 2 Corinthians 11:13-14</figcaption></figure>

<p>Jesus is emphasizing that deception will not only be prevelant in the lead-up to His coming, but it will also be powerful because it will be accompanied by signs and wonders. And it’s not just people who can pretend to be something they’re not, but Satan himself can appear as an angel of light.</p>

<p>Now the Spirit speaketh expressly, that in the latter times some shall depart from the faith, <em>giving heed to seducing spirits</em>, and doctrines of devils.</p>
</blockquote><figcaption>— 1 Timothy 4:1</figcaption></figure>

<p>The interest in psychics, channelers, spiritists, and the occult will only continue to grow.</p>

<figure><blockquote>
<p>And ye shall hear of <em>wars and rumours of wars</em>: see that ye be not troubled: for all these things must come to pass, but the end is not yet. For nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom: and <em>there shall be famines, and pestilences, and earthquakes, in divers places</em>.</p>
</blockquote><figcaption>— Matthew 24:6-7</figcaption></figure>

<figure><blockquote>
<p>All these are the <em>beginning of birth pains</em>.</p>
</blockquote><figcaption>— Matthew 24:8, NIV</figcaption></figure>

<p>While wars, rumors of wars, famines, epidemics, and earthquakes have always been around, Jesus compares them to birth pains, which get more frequent and more intense with time.</p>

<p>And the nations were angry, and thy wrath is come, and the time of the dead, that they should be judged, and that thou shouldest give reward unto thy servants the prophets, and to the saints, and them that fear thy name, small and great; and <em>shouldest destroy them which destroy the earth</em>.</p>
</blockquote><figcaption>— Revelation 11:18</figcaption></figure>

<p>The human race now have the ability to destroy the earth through weapons of mass destruction, such as the atomic bomb.</p>

<p>For yourselves know perfectly that the day of the Lord so cometh as a thief in the night. <em>For when they shall say, Peace and safety; then sudden destruction cometh upon them</em>, as travail upon a woman with child; and they shall not escape.</p>
</blockquote><figcaption>— 1 Thessalonians 5:2-3</figcaption></figure>

<p>This is related to the previous sign of fear about the future because when there will be talk of peace and safety, the reality that follows will be the opposite.</p>

<figure><blockquote>
<p>And because iniquity shall abound, the <em>love of many shall wax cold</em>.</p>
</blockquote><figcaption>— Matthew 24:12</figcaption></figure>

<figure><blockquote>
<p>This know also, that in the last days perilous times shall come. For men shall be <em>lovers of their own selves, covetous, boasters, proud, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy, Without natural affection, trucebreakers, false accusers, incontinent, fierce, despisers of those that are good, traitors, heady, highminded, lovers of pleasures more than lovers of God; having a form of godliness, but denying the power thereof</em>: from such turn away.</p>

<figure><blockquote>
<p>And take heed to yourselves, lest at any time your hearts be overcharged with <em>surfeiting, and drunkenness, and cares of this life</em>, and so that day come upon you unawares.</p>
</blockquote><figcaption>— Luke 21:34</figcaption></figure>

<figure><blockquote>
<p>But <em>as the days of Noe were, so shall also the coming of the Son of man be</em>. For as in the days that were before the flood they were eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, until the day that Noe entered into the ark, and knew not until the flood came, and took them all away; so shall also the coming of the Son of man be.</p>
</blockquote><figcaption>— Matthew 24:37-39</figcaption></figure>

<p>There’s nothing wrong with marriage as it was instituted and blessed by God, and it’s impossible to survive without nourishing our bodies. The point is in Noah’s days most people ignored him. Life is busy, and it’s easy to get preoccupied with temporal things and neglect spiritual things. Where do our own priorities stand?</p>

<p>Go to now, ye rich men, weep and howl for your miseries that shall come upon you. <em>Your riches are corrupted</em>, and your garments are motheaten. Your gold and silver is cankered; and the rust of them shall be a witness against you, and shall eat your flesh as it were fire. Ye have heaped treasure together for the last days. Behold, the <em>hire of the labourers who have reaped down your fields, which is of you kept back by fraud, crieth</em>: and the cries of them which have reaped are entered into the ears of the Lord of sabaoth. Ye have lived in pleasure on the earth, and been wanton; ye have nourished your hearts, as in a day of slaughter.</p>
</blockquote><figcaption>— James 5:1-5</figcaption></figure>

<p>Rising wealth inequality, fraud, and trouble between capital and labor will continue to be prominent until the coming of Christ.</p>

<p>What was once an impossible task is now a reality! With the rise of media, like television, radio, and the internet, the gospel is now going out to the entire world. Everyone will be exposed to it before He returns.</p>

<p>God does not want anyone to be surprised by and unprepared for His coming; His desire is for every single person to be saved.</p>

<p><em>Watch therefore</em>: for ye know not what hour your Lord doth come. But know this, that if the goodman of the house had known in what watch the thief would come, he would have watched, and would not have suffered his house to be broken up. Therefore <em>be ye also ready</em>: for in such an hour as ye think not the Son of man cometh.</p>
</blockquote><figcaption>— Matthew 24:42-44</figcaption></figure>

<figure><blockquote>
<p>Watch ye therefore, and <em>pray always</em>, that ye may be accounted worthy to escape all these things that shall come to pass, and to stand before the Son of man.</p>
</blockquote><figcaption>— Luke 21:36</figcaption></figure>

<figure><blockquote>
<p>I will say of the LORD, <em>He is my refuge and my fortress: my God; in him will I trust</em>. Surely <em>he shall deliver thee</em> from the snare of the fowler, and from the noisome pestilence. He shall cover thee with his feathers, and under his wings shalt thou trust: <em>his truth shall be thy shield and buckler</em>.</p>
</blockquote><figcaption>— Psalm 91:2-4</figcaption></figure>

<p>Those who watch for signs of Christ’s coming and pray that He will help them to be ready to meet Him won’t be disappointed. His truth will protect them from deception, and God will be with them every step of the way, no matter what happens.</p>
