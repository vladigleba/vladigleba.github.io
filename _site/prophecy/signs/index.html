<p>And as he sat upon the mount of Olives, the disciples came unto him privately, saying, Tell us, when shall these things be? and what shall be the sign of thy coming, and of the end of the world? And Jesus answered and said unto them, <em>Take heed that no man deceive you. For many shall come in my name, saying, I am Christ; and shall deceive many</em>.</p>
</blockquote><figcaption>— Matthew 24:3-5</figcaption></figure><figure><blockquote>
<p>For there <em>shall arise false Christs, and false prophets, and shall shew great signs and wonders</em>; insomuch that, if it were possible, they shall deceive the very elect.</p>
</blockquote><figcaption>— Matthew 24:24</figcaption></figure><figure><blockquote>
<p>For such are false apostles, deceitful workers, transforming themselves into the apostles of Christ. And no marvel; for <em>Satan himself is transformed into an angel of light</em>.</p>
</blockquote><figcaption>— 2 Corinthians 11:13-14</figcaption></figure><p>Jesus emphasizes that deception will not only be prevalent in the lead-up to His coming, but also powerful, as it will be accompanied by signs and wonders. Beyond people claiming to be false Christs, Satan himself can appear as an angel of light. Jim Jones and David Koresh are examples of false prophets who claimed to be Christ, but the danger runs even deeper than that.</p><p>Over the past few decades, the New Age teachings of pantheism (all is God) and panentheism (God is in all) have been creeping into Christianity, leading some to believe that they are actually god. These teachings build upon the serpent’s original lie, “ye shall be as gods” (<a href="https://bible-api.com/Genesis%203%3A5?translation=kjv" class="verse-link" data-reference="Genesis 3:5" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Genesis 3:5</a>), and fulfill Christ’s prophecy that many would say, “I am Christ” (<a href="https://bible-api.com/Matthew%2024%3A5?translation=kjv" class="verse-link" data-reference="Matthew 24:5" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Matthew 24:5</a>). Anyone who teaches that a human being can become god—or even Christ—spreads deception, because the truth is Jesus never promised us deity. He promised us eternal life (<a href="https://bible-api.com/Romans%206%3A23?translation=kjv" class="verse-link" data-reference="Romans 6:23" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Romans 6:23</a>), yes, but never deity. We are and will always be His created beings; He is our Creator God.</p></section>

<p>Knowing this first, that <em>there shall come in the last days scoffers, walking after their own lusts</em>, and saying, Where is the promise of his coming? for since the fathers fell asleep, all things continue as they were from the beginning of the creation. For this they willingly are ignorant of, that by the word of God the heavens were of old, and the earth standing out of the water and in the water: whereby the world that then was, being overflowed with water, perished.</p>
</blockquote><figcaption>— 2 Peter 3:3-6</figcaption></figure><figure><blockquote>
<p>For the time will come when <em>they will not endure sound doctrine</em>; but after their own lusts shall they heap to themselves teachers, having itching ears; and <em>they shall turn away their ears from the truth, and shall be turned unto fables</em>.</p>
</blockquote><figcaption>— 2 Timothy 4:3-4</figcaption></figure><p>It is incredible how Paul, after mentioning scoffers, goes back to the Genesis account—specifically the creation week, which identifies God as the Creator of the world, and the worldwide flood. A denial of both of these accounts lays the foundation for many false but widely held views today, such as Darwinian evolution, progressive creationism, and atheism. Perhaps the clearest example of the fulfillment of these verses, however, is the rise of higher criticism, which denies that the Bible is a divinely inspired book altogether.</p><p>Efforts to undermine the authority of the Bible are alive in Christian churches too. Proponents of mysticism, for example, emphasize a subjective, experiential Christianity over one that is based on the objective and authoritative Word of God. This is a modern equivalent of another effort to undermine Scripture that reaches back thousands of years: the elevation of church tradition above Scripture, which, incidentally, was one of the rallying cries of the Reformation—<em>sola scriptura</em> (“Scripture alone”).</p></section>

<p>Now the Spirit speaketh expressly, that in the latter times some shall depart from the faith, <em>giving heed to seducing spirits, and doctrines of devils</em>.</p>
</blockquote><figcaption>— 1 Timothy 4:1</figcaption></figure><p>The interest in psychics, mediums, witchcraft, and the occult is as old as time, but it will intensify in the final days of earth’s history. Surprisingly, these practices are alive in Christianity as well through the meditative techniques of spiritual formation, which allegedly enable the practitioner to come into God’s presence—and even hear His voice—on demand. This is achieved through an altered state of consciousness, known as “entering the silence,” in which all thinking is suppressed, resulting in a trance-like, meditative state—the same state that witches, psychics, and channelers enter when they do their work. When this state is reached, the mind is opened to the influence of evil supernatural forces. The truth is God never asks us to suspend our reasoning powers when we pray or study His Word; on the contrary, He wants us to be fully engaged (<a href="https://bible-api.com/Isaiah%201%3A18?translation=kjv" class="verse-link" data-reference="Isaiah 1:18" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Isaiah 1:18</a>).

<p>All these are the <em>beginning of birth pains</em>.</p>
</blockquote><figcaption>— Matthew 24:8, NIV</figcaption></figure><p>While wars, rumors of wars, famines, epidemics, and earthquakes have always existed, Jesus likened them to birth pains—which increase in frequency and intensity over time—to emphasize that these signs will follow the same pattern.</p></section>

Such a state, on a societal level, makes people easy to control and manipulate—a fertile ground for tyranny and scapegoat-seeking narratives, which can easily lead to previously unimaginable atrocities. The Bible predicts <a href="/prophecy/usa/">this will happen</a> just before Christ’s Second Coming.</p></section>

<p>And because iniquity shall abound, the <em>love of many shall wax cold</em>.</p>
</blockquote><figcaption>— Matthew 24:12</figcaption></figure><figure><blockquote>
<p>This know also, that in the last days perilous times shall come. For men shall be <em>lovers of their own selves, covetous, boasters, proud, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy, Without natural affection, trucebreakers, false accusers, incontinent, fierce, despisers of those that are good, traitors, heady, highminded, lovers of pleasures more than lovers of God; having a form of godliness, but denying the power thereof</em>: from such turn away.</p>
</blockquote><figcaption>— 2 Timothy 3:1-5</figcaption></figure><p>As the love of many grows cold, lawlessness will assert itself in society, driven by selfishness in the hearts of those who have rejected God. When the restraining power of God departs through persistent rejection (<a href="https://bible-api.com/Romans%201%3A28?translation=kjv" class="verse-link" data-reference="Romans 1:28" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Romans 1:28</a>), human behavior will begin to resemble that of the pre-flood world, when every thought was only evil continually (<a href="https://bible-api.com/Genesis%206%3A5?translation=kjv" class="verse-link" data-reference="Genesis 6:5" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Genesis 6:5</a>). But this trend will not be universal. Communities of genuine followers of Christ will exist throughout the world who reflect His character. Specifically, they will be known for their love—which is, in fact, the love of God manifested in them (<a href="https://bible-api.com/John%2013%3A35?translation=kjv" class="verse-link" data-reference="John 13:35" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">John 13:35</a>; <a href="https://bible-api.com/1%20John%202%3A5?translation=kjv" class="verse-link" data-reference="1 John 2:5" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">1 John 2:5</a>). Thus, in the end, there will be only two classes of people: those who give themselves over to sin, selfishness, and evil, and those who give themselves over to God’s loving mercy and enabling grace. Whether we realize it or not, the decisions we make on a daily basis are bringing us closer to one of these groups.</p></section>

</blockquote><figcaption>— Luke 21:34</figcaption></figure><figure><blockquote>
<p>But <em>as the days of Noe were, so shall also the coming of the Son of man be</em>. For as in the days that were before the flood they were eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, until the day that Noe entered into the ark, and knew not until the flood came, and took them all away; so shall also the coming of the Son of man be.</p>
</blockquote><figcaption>— Matthew 24:37-39</figcaption></figure><p>Obviously, there is nothing wrong with marriage; after all, it was instituted and blessed by God Himself. Likewise, it is impossible to survive without nourishing our bodies; we must eat, which means we must work, and for the majority of people, work consumes the largest part of their lives. Most are busy trying to survive, so in the absence of intentionality, it is easy to become preoccupied with the temporal at the expense of the spiritual. Yet Christ’s words quietly ring in the background: “Seek ye first the kingdom of God, and his righteousness; and all these things shall be added unto you” (<a href="https://bible-api.com/Matthew%206%3A33?translation=kjv" class="verse-link" data-reference="Matthew 6:33" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Matthew 6:33</a>). In Noah’s days, most people ignored his invitations to come into the ark because they were too busy doing other things. Where do our priorities stand?</p></section>

<p>Go to now, ye rich men, weep and howl for your miseries that shall come upon you. <em>Your riches are corrupted</em>, and your garments are motheaten. Your gold and silver is cankered; and the rust of them shall be a witness against you, and shall eat your flesh as it were fire. Ye have heaped treasure together for the last days. Behold, the <em>hire of the labourers who have reaped down your fields, which is of you kept back by fraud, crieth</em>: and the cries of them which have reaped are entered into the ears of the Lord of sabaoth. Ye have lived in pleasure on the earth, and been wanton; ye have nourished your hearts, as in a day of slaughter.</p>
</blockquote><figcaption>— James 5:1-5</figcaption></figure><p>The gap between rich and poor, coupled with corruption, fraud, and disputes between employers and workers, will continue to widen as we draw nearer to the coming of Christ. As the Holy Spirit is repeatedly resisted and withdrawn, people are left to the control of their carnal nature, whose chief aim has always been preservation and exaltation of self.</p></section>

</blockquote><figcaption>— Matthew 24:14</figcaption></figure><p>With the rapid advancement of communication technology over the past decades—such as television, radio, and the internet—the gospel is now being preached to even the remotest corners of the globe. What once seemed an impossible task has now become a reality. The Bible teaches that religious revivals—both <a href="/prophecy/usa/#will-there-be-a-genuine-revival">genuine</a> and <a href="/prophecy/usa/#will-there-be-a-false-religious-revival">counterfeit</a>—will spread across the world, and religious discussions will take center stage, resonating through the legislative halls and judicial courtrooms of nations just prior to Christ’s return. Religion in general, and the enforcement of God’s law in particular, will be on everyone’s mind.</p></section>

<p>And I beheld when he had opened the sixth seal, and, lo, there was <em>a great earthquake</em>; and <em>the sun became black as sackcloth of hair, and the moon became as blood</em>; and <em>the stars of heaven fell</em> unto the earth, even as a fig tree casteth her untimely figs, when she is shaken of a mighty wind.</p>
</blockquote><figcaption>— Revelation 6:12-13</figcaption></figure><p>Before the <a href="/prophecy/investigative/">heavenly judgment began in 1844</a>, three specific signs were fulfilled in the exact sequence outlined in Revelation 6.</p><p>The first (“a great earthquake”) was fulfilled by the Great Lisbon Earthquake of November 1, 1755. The shaking lasted for about six minutes and was so powerful that it was felt across Europe and North Africa, generating tsunami waves that reached as far as the Caribbean. Charles Lyell, a Scottish geologist, described the earthquake’s power: “In no part of the volcanic region of Southern Europe has so tremendous an earthquake occurred in modern times as that which began on the 1st of November, 1755, at Lisbon. A sound of thunder was heard underground, and immediately afterward a violent shock threw down the greater part of that city. In the course of about six minutes, sixty thousand persons perished. The sea first retired, and laid the bar dry; it then rolled in, rising fifty feet above its ordinary level. The mountains of Arrabida, Estrella, Julio, Marvan, and Cintra, being some of the largest in Portugal, were impetuously shaken, as it were from their very foundations; and some of them opened at their summits, which were split and rent in a wonderful manner, huge masses of them being thrown down into the subjacent valleys. Flames are related to have issued from these mountains, which are supposed to have been electric; they are also said to have smoked; but vast clouds of dust may have given rise to this appearance.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">[1]</a></sup></p><p>The second sign (“the sun became black as sackcloth of hair, and the moon became as blood”) was fulfilled by the New England Dark Day of May 19, 1780. The sun was so completely darkened that candles were required from noon onward, and later that evening, the moon appeared red. An eyewitness in Massachusetts described the scene: “Fear, anxiety, and awe gradually filled the minds of the people. Women stood at the door, looking out upon the dark landscape; men returned from their labor in the fields; the carpenter left his tools, the blacksmith his forge, the tradesman his counter. Schools were dismissed, and tremblingly the children fled homeward. Travelers put up at the nearest farmhouse. ‘What is coming?’ queried every lip and heart. It seemed as if a hurricane was about to dash across the land, or as if it was the day of the consummation of all things. Candles were used; and hearth fires shone as brightly as on a moonless evening in autumn…. Fowls retired to their roosts and went to sleep, cattle gathered at the pasture bars and lowed, frogs peeped, birds sang their evening songs, and bats flew about. But the human knew that night had not come.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn2" id="fnref2">[2]</a></sup></p><p>The final sign (“the stars of heaven fell”) was fulfilled by the great Leonids meteor shower of November 13, 1833. Witnesses reported that the meteors fell like rain and that no language could describe their splendor. “Its sublimity and awful beauty still linger in many minds. … Never did rain fall much thicker than the meteors fell toward the earth; east, west, north, and south, it was the same. In a word, the whole heavens seemed in motion.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn3" id="fnref3">[3]</a></sup> “No language, indeed, can come up to the splendor of that magnificent display; … no one who did not witness it can form an adequate conception of its glory. It seemed as if the whole starry heavens had congregated at one point near the zenith, and were simultaneously shooting forth, with the velocity of lightning, to every part of the horizon; and yet they were not exhausted—thousands swiftly followed in the tracks of thousands, as if created for the occasion.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn4" id="fnref4">[4]</a></sup></p><p>Jesus prophesied that all three signs will occur again just prior to His Second Coming (<a href="https://bible-api.com/Matthew%2024%3A29-30?translation=kjv" class="verse-link" data-reference="Matthew 24:29-30" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Matthew 24:29-30</a>; <a href="https://bible-api.com/Mark%2013%3A24-26?translation=kjv" class="verse-link" data-reference="Mark 13:24-26" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mark 13:24-26</a>; <a href="https://bible-api.com/Luke%2021%3A25?translation=kjv" class="verse-link" data-reference="Luke 21:25" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Luke 21:25</a>).</p></section>

</blockquote><figcaption>— Ezekiel 33:11</figcaption></figure><p>God does not want anyone to be caught off guard or unprepared for His coming. His desire is that every person be saved, so He is patient with us, granting repeated opportunities and every spiritual blessing (<a href="https://bible-api.com/Ephesians%201%3A3-4?translation=kjv" class="verse-link" data-reference="Ephesians 1:3-4" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ephesians 1:3-4</a>) we need to become His sons and daughters.
