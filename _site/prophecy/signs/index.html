<p>And as he sat upon the mount of Olives, the disciples came unto him privately, saying, Tell us, when shall these things be? and what shall be the sign of thy coming, and of the end of the world? And Jesus answered and said unto them, <em>Take heed that no man deceive you. For many shall come in my name, saying, I am Christ; and shall deceive many</em>.</p>
</blockquote><figcaption>— Matthew 24:3-5</figcaption></figure><figure><blockquote>
<p>For there <em>shall arise false Christs, and false prophets, and shall shew great signs and wonders</em>; insomuch that, if it were possible, they shall deceive the very elect.</p>
</blockquote><figcaption>— Matthew 24:24</figcaption></figure><figure><blockquote>
<p>For such are false apostles, deceitful workers, transforming themselves into the apostles of Christ. And no marvel; for <em>Satan himself is transformed into an angel of light</em>.</p>
</blockquote><figcaption>— 2 Corinthians 11:13-14</figcaption></figure><p>Jesus emphasizes that deception will not only be prevalent in the lead-up to His coming, but also powerful, as it will be accompanied by signs and wonders. Beyond people claiming to be false Christs, Satan himself can appear as an angel of light. Jim Jones and David Koresh are examples of false prophets who claimed to be Christ, but the danger runs even deeper than that.</p><p>Over the past few decades, the New Age teachings of pantheism (all is God) and panentheism (God is in all) have been creeping into Christianity, leading some to believe that they are actually god. This is a continuation of the serpent’s original lie, “ye shall be as gods” (<a href="https://bible-api.com/Genesis%203%3A5?translation=kjv" class="verse-link" data-reference="Genesis 3:5" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Genesis 3:5</a>), and a fulfillment of Christ’s prophecy that many would say “I am Christ” (<a href="https://bible-api.com/Matthew%2024%3A5?translation=kjv" class="verse-link" data-reference="Matthew 24:5" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Matthew 24:5</a>). Anybody who teaches that a human being can become god, or even Christ, spreads deception because the truth is Jesus never promised us deity. He promised us eternal life (<a href="https://bible-api.com/Romans%206%3A23?translation=kjv" class="verse-link" data-reference="Romans 6:23" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Romans 6:23</a>), yes, but never deity. We are and will alawys be His created beings; He is our Creator God.</p></section>

<p>Now the Spirit speaketh expressly, that in the latter times some shall depart from the faith, <em>giving heed to seducing spirits</em>, and doctrines of devils.</p>
</blockquote><figcaption>— 1 Timothy 4:1</figcaption></figure><p>The interest in psychics, channelers, spiritists, and the occult is as old as time, but it will insensify in the final days of earth’s history. Surprisingly, these practices are alive in Christianity as well through the meditative techniques of spiritual formation, which allegedly enable the practitioner to come into God’s presence—and even hear His voice—on demand. This is achieved through an altered state of consciousness, known as “entering the silence,” in which all thinking is suppressed, resulting in a trance-like, meditative state—the same state that witches, psychics, and channelers enter when they do their work. When this state is reached, the mind is opened to the influence of evil supernatural forces. (For more information, see Howard Peth’s book <em>The Dangers of Contemplative Prayer</em>.)</p></section>

Such a state, on a societal level, makes people easy to control and manipulate—a fertile ground for tyranny and scape-goat-seeking narratives, which can easily lead to previously unimaginable atrocities. The Bible predicts <a href="/prophecy/usa/">this will happen</a> just before Christ’s Second Coming.</p></section>

<p>And because iniquity shall abound, the <em>love of many shall wax cold</em>.</p>
</blockquote><figcaption>— Matthew 24:12</figcaption></figure><figure><blockquote>
<p>This know also, that in the last days perilous times shall come. For men shall be <em>lovers of their own selves, covetous, boasters, proud, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy, Without natural affection, trucebreakers, false accusers, incontinent, fierce, despisers of those that are good, traitors, heady, highminded, lovers of pleasures more than lovers of God; having a form of godliness, but denying the power thereof</em>: from such turn away.</p>
</blockquote><figcaption>— 2 Timothy 3:1-5</figcaption></figure><p>As the love of many grows cold, evil will begin to assert itself in the lives of thoses who have rejected God. When the restraining power of God leaves through persistent rejection (<a href="https://bible-api.com/Romans%201%3A28?translation=kjv" class="verse-link" data-reference="Romans 1:28" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Romans 1:28</a>), human behavior will begin to resemble that of the pre-flood world when every thought was only evil continually (<a href="https://bible-api.com/Genesis%206%3A5?translation=kjv" class="verse-link" data-reference="Genesis 6:5" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Genesis 6:5</a>). But this trend will not be universal. Communities of genuine followers of Chirst will exist throughout the world who  reflect His character and who will be known for their love—which is actually the love of God manifested in them (<a href="https://bible-api.com/John%2013%3A35?translation=kjv" class="verse-link" data-reference="John 13:35" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">John 13:35</a>; <a href="https://bible-api.com/1%20John%202%3A5?translation=kjv" class="verse-link" data-reference="1 John 2:5" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">1 John 2:5</a>). Thus, in the end, there will be only two classes of people: those who give themselves over to sin, selfishness, and evil and those who give themselves over to God’s loving mercy and enabling grace. Whether we realize it or not, the decisions we make on a daily basis are bringing us closer to one of these groups.</p></section>

</blockquote><figcaption>— Luke 21:34</figcaption></figure><figure><blockquote>
<p>But <em>as the days of Noe were, so shall also the coming of the Son of man be</em>. For as in the days that were before the flood they were eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, until the day that Noe entered into the ark, and knew not until the flood came, and took them all away; so shall also the coming of the Son of man be.</p>
</blockquote><figcaption>— Matthew 24:37-39</figcaption></figure><p>Obviously, there is nothing wrong with marriage because it was instituted and blessed by God Himself. Moreover, it is impossible to survive without nourishing our bodies; we must eat, which means we must work, and for the majority of people, work consumes the largest part of their lives. Most are busy trying to survive, so in the absence of intentionality, it is easy to become preoccupied with the temporal to the neglect of the spiritual. But Christ’s words, nonetheless, quietly ring in the background: “seek ye first the kingdom of God, and his righteousness; and all these things shall be added unto you.” (<a href="https://bible-api.com/Matthew%206%3A33?translation=kjv" class="verse-link" data-reference="Matthew 6:33" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Matthew 6:33</a>). In Noah’s days most people ignored his invitations to come into the ark because they were too busy doing other things. Where do our priorities stand?</p></section>

Ye have lived in pleasure on the earth, and been wanton; ye have nourished your hearts, as in a day of slaughter.</p>
</blockquote><figcaption>— James 5:1-5</figcaption></figure><p>The gap between rich and poor, coupled with corruption, fraud, and disputes between employers and workers, will only continue to rise as we draw nearer to the coming of Christ. As the Holy Spirit is repeatedly resisted and withdrawn, people are left to the control of their carnal nature, whose chief aim has always been the preservation and exaltation of self.</p></section>

<p><em>Watch therefore</em>: for ye know not what hour your Lord doth come. But know this, that if the goodman of the house had known in what watch the thief would come, he would have watched, and would not have suffered his house to be broken up. Therefore <em>be ye also ready</em>: for in such an hour as ye think not the Son of man cometh.</p>

<p>Watch ye therefore, and <em>pray always</em>, that ye may be accounted worthy to escape all these things that shall come to pass, and to stand before the Son of man.</p>
</blockquote><figcaption>— Luke 21:36</figcaption></figure><figure><blockquote>
<p>I will say of the LORD, <em>He is my refuge and my fortress: my God; in him will I trust</em>. Surely <em>he shall deliver thee</em> from the snare of the fowler, and from the noisome pestilence. He shall cover thee with his feathers, and under his wings shalt thou trust: <em>his truth shall be thy shield and buckler</em>.</p>
</blockquote><figcaption>— Psalm 91:2-4</figcaption></figure><p>Those who watch for the signs of Christ’s coming, and earnestly pray that He will prepare them for it, will experience His unfailing faithfulness and enabling grace. If receieved and obeyed, His truth will protect them from deception, and He will be with them every step of the way, no matter what happens around them.</p></section>
