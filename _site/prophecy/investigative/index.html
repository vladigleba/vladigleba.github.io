<p>Then I lifted up mine eyes, and saw, and, behold, there stood before the river <em>a ram which had two horns</em>: and the two horns were high; but one was higher than the other, and the higher came up last. I saw the ram pushing westward, and northward, and southward; so that no beasts might stand before him, neither was there any that could deliver out of his hand; but he did according to his will, and became great.</p>
</blockquote><figcaption>— Daniel 8:3-4</figcaption></figure><figure><blockquote>
<p>The ram which thou sawest having two horns are <em>the kings of Media and Persia</em>.</p>
</blockquote><figcaption>— Daniel 8:20</figcaption></figure><p>Daniel sees a two-horned lamb, which we later learn represents the kingdom of Medo-Persia. This same kingdom was represented by a bear in <a href="https://bible-api.com/Daniel%207%3A5?translation=kjv" class="verse-link" data-reference="Daniel 7:5" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Daniel 7:5</a> since the Bible operates on the principle of “repeat and expand” where the prophecy is repeated and more detail is added.</p></section>

<p>And as I was considering, behold, <em>an he goat came from the west</em> on the face of the whole earth, and touched not the ground: and the goat had a notable horn between his eyes. And he came to the ram that had two horns, which I had seen standing before the river, and ran unto him in the fury of his power. And I saw him come close unto the ram, and he was moved with choler against him, and smote the ram, and brake his two horns: and there was no power in the ram to stand before him, but he cast him down to the ground, and stamped upon him: and there was none that could deliver the ram out of his hand. Therefore the he goat waxed very great: and when he was strong, the great horn was broken; and for it came up four notable ones toward the four winds of heaven.</p>
</blockquote><figcaption>— Daniel 8:5-8</figcaption></figure><figure><blockquote>
<p>And the <em>rough goat is the king of Grecia</em>: and the great horn that is between his eyes is the first king. Now that being broken, whereas four stood up for it, four kingdoms shall stand up out of the nation, but not in his power.</p>
</blockquote><figcaption>— Daniel 8:21-22</figcaption></figure><p>Daniel then sees a goat with a large horn moving so swiftly that its feet never touch the ground. The goat attacks the ram, conquers it, and the goat’s horn is then broken off and replaced with four other horns. We later learn this goat represents the kingdom of Greece. The great horn is none other than Alexander the Great, while the four horns it’s replaced by represent the four kingdoms into which his empire was divided. In <a href="https://bible-api.com/Daniel%207%3A6?translation=kjv" class="verse-link" data-reference="Daniel 7:6" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Daniel 7:6</a> this same kingdom is represented by a leopard with four heads.</p></section>

        </svg></a></h2><figure><blockquote>
<p>And out of one of them <em>came forth a little horn, which waxed exceeding great</em>, toward the south, and toward the east, and toward the pleasant land. And it waxed great, even to the host of heaven; and it cast down some of the host and of the stars to the ground, and stamped upon them. Yea, <em>he magnified himself even to the prince of the host</em>, and by him the daily sacrifice was taken away, and <em>the place of his sanctuary was cast down</em>. And an host was given him against the daily sacrifice by reason of transgression, and <em>it cast down the truth to the ground</em>; and it practised, and prospered.</p>
</blockquote><figcaption>— Daniel 8:9-12</figcaption></figure><p>Next, Daniel sees a little horn emerge. Using the principle of “repeat and expand” this can be none other than Rome in both its pagan and papal forms because Daniel <a href="/prophecy/europe/">chapter 2</a> and <a href="/prophecy/antichrist/">chapter 7</a> both point to Rome as the next kingdom after Greece. Later, this little horn is “broken without hand” (<a href="https://bible-api.com/Daniel%208%3A25?translation=kjv" class="verse-link" data-reference="Daniel 8:25" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Daniel 8:25</a>), meaning destroyed supernaturally by the coming of Christ, which is an echo of <a href="https://bible-api.com/Daniel%202%3A34?translation=kjv" class="verse-link" data-reference="Daniel 2:34" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Daniel 2:34</a> where a stone “cut out without hands” puts an end to human civilization. This also fits with <a href="https://bible-api.com/Daniel%207%3A24-27?translation=kjv" class="verse-link" data-reference="Daniel 7:24-27" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Daniel 7:24-27</a> where it says that papal Rome will be overcome by the kingdom of Christ.</p><p><a href="https://bible-api.com/Daniel%208%3A9?translation=kjv" class="verse-link" data-reference="Daniel 8:9" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Daniel 8:9</a> gives another clue when it describes the direction of little horn’s expansion, which fits the expansion of Rome perfectly: toward the south (Egypt), toward the east (Macedonia), and the “pleasant land” (Palestine). Furthermore, <a href="https://bible-api.com/Daniel%208%3A4?translation=kjv" class="verse-link" data-reference="Daniel 8:4" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Daniel 8:4</a> describes Medo-Persia as becoming “great,” Greece becomes “very great” (<a href="https://bible-api.com/Daniel%208%3A8?translation=kjv" class="verse-link" data-reference="Daniel 8:8" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Daniel 8:8</a>), and the little horn becomes “exceeding great.” Rome is the only power following Greece that became “exceeding great.”</p><p>The little horn also “magnified himself even to the prince of the host” (<a href="https://bible-api.com/Daniel%208%3A11?translation=kjv" class="verse-link" data-reference="Daniel 8:11" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Daniel 8:11</a>), and verse 25 says it will “stand up against the Prince of princes” (<a href="https://bible-api.com/Daniel%208%3A25?translation=kjv" class="verse-link" data-reference="Daniel 8:25" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Daniel 8:25</a>). These are clear references to Jesus Christ, and once again, pagan Rome, being the power that crucified Him, fits these points. Papal Rome, on the other hand, effectively tries to replace Jesus’ ministry, as our High Priest in the heavenly sanctuary (<a href="https://bible-api.com/Hebrews%208%3A1-2?translation=kjv" class="verse-link" data-reference="Hebrews 8:1-2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hebrews 8:1-2</a>), with an earthly priesthood claiming to forgive sins even though the Bible teaches Jesus is our only Mediator (<a href="https://bible-api.com/1%20Timothy%202%3A5?translation=kjv" class="verse-link" data-reference="1 Timothy 2:5" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">1 Timothy 2:5</a>), and only God can forgive sins (<a href="https://bible-api.com/Luke%205%3A21?translation=kjv" class="verse-link" data-reference="Luke 5:21" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Luke 5:21</a>). This casts the truth of the heavenly sanctuary to the ground (<a href="https://bible-api.com/Daniel%208%3A11?translation=kjv" class="verse-link" data-reference="Daniel 8:11" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Daniel 8:11</a>), trampling it underfoot (<a href="https://bible-api.com/Daniel%208%3A13?translation=kjv" class="verse-link" data-reference="Daniel 8:13" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Daniel 8:13</a>), thereby fulfilling those points as well.</p></section>

<p>Then I heard one saint speaking, and another saint said unto that certain saint which spake, How long shall be the vision concerning the daily sacrifice, and the transgression of desolation, to give both the sanctuary and the host to be trodden under foot? And he said unto me, <em>Unto two thousand and three hundred days; then shall the sanctuary be cleansed</em>.</p>
</blockquote><figcaption>— Daniel 8:13-14</figcaption></figure><p>The reply was that the sanctuary would be cleansed after 2,300 days, which is 2,300 literal years in Bible prophecy (<a href="https://bible-api.com/Ezekiel%204%3A6?translation=kjv" class="verse-link" data-reference="Ezekiel 4:6" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ezekiel 4:6</a>; <a href="https://bible-api.com/Numbers%2014%3A34?translation=kjv" class="verse-link" data-reference="Numbers 14:34" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Numbers 14:34</a>). We’ve already learned that in the time of ancient Israel the <a href="/gospel/sanctuary/">earthly sanctuary</a> was cleansed on the Day of Atonement. This was a day when the camp of Israel was cleansed from sin because God’s true followers were identified and their sins removed, while those who clung to sin were separated from the camp. In the same manner, Daniel is shown here that sin and the little horn power would not control and oppress the world forever; instead, God would intervene after 2,300 years with the heavenly Day of Atonement during which the process of removing sin would begin.</p></section>

</blockquote><figcaption>— Daniel 9:24</figcaption></figure><p>The angel says that seventy weeks were alloted to the Jewish people, which would equal 490 days (70 * 7), which represent 490 years in Bible prophecy. At the time of the vision God’s people were in captivity in Medo-Persia, but soon they were to return home, and God was giving them 490 years out of the 2,300 as another opportunity to repent from their sins and be reconciled to Him.</p></section>

So starting with -457 and adding 483 gives us 26, but since there is no year 0, we add one year, which brings us to the year A.D. 27, the baptism of Jesus (<a href="https://bible-api.com/Luke%203%3A21-22?translation=kjv" class="verse-link" data-reference="Luke 3:21-22" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Luke 3:21-22</a>).

The prophecy, therefore, not only makes it plain that Jesus is the Messiah, but it also testifies that the Bible is divinely inspired!</p></section>

According to Daniel, this was the year when the cleansing of the sanctuary began. We’ve already learned that when the system of animal sacrifices was made obsolete by the death of Jesus, the veil of the temple was torn by the divine hand of God. Shortly after, the temple itself was destroyed by the Romans in A.D. 70 and never rebuilt, so the sanctuary that is cleansed can only be the heavenly one, of which the earthly one was a symbol.</p><p>The cleansing of the earthly sanctuary always occured on the <a href="/gospel/sanctuary/#what-was-the-day-of-atonement">Day of Atonement</a> (to “atone” means to be “at one” with God), which was a time of judgment during which God’s people examined their souls to make sure all of their sins were confessed, forsaken, and symbolically “blotted out” from the sanctuary; likewise, the heavenly judgment began in 1844 and the sins of God’s people began to be removed from the books of heaven (<a href="https://bible-api.com/Daniel%207%3A10?translation=kjv" class="verse-link" data-reference="Daniel 7:10" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Daniel 7:10</a>). In other words, prior to 1844, confessed and forsaken sins were forgiven by God because of Jesus’ substitutionary sacrifice on the sinners behalf, but they remained on the books. After 1844, when the heavenly judgment began, God started to blot out even the very record of those confessed sins (<a href="https://bible-api.com/Acts%203%3A19?translation=kjv" class="verse-link" data-reference="Acts 3:19" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Acts 3:19</a>)!</p></section>

</blockquote><figcaption>— Ezekiel 9:5-6</figcaption></figure><p>In the Bible judgment always begins with God’s people. The heavenly judgment that began in 1844 is the “pre-advent judgment,” the first phase, since it occurs before the second coming of Christ. Jesus returns with His reward (<a href="https://bible-api.com/Revelation%2022%3A11-12?translation=kjv" class="verse-link" data-reference="Revelation 22:11-12" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Revelation 22:11-12</a>), which means those who are saved have been identified and their reward determined. Just like in the earthly Day of Atonement judgment there was a separation of the unrepentant from the camp of Israel before sin was removed from the sanctuary (<a href="https://bible-api.com/Leviticus%2023%3A29?translation=kjv" class="verse-link" data-reference="Leviticus 23:29" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Leviticus 23:29</a>), so in the heavenly sanctuary there is an identification of who is saved and who is lost during the pre-advent judgment.</p><p>This is why Peter says the judgment begins with the “house of God,” meaning the people of God. Anyone who has claimed to be a Christian, alive or dead, will be examined during this judgment.
