<p>For the Lord himself shall <em>descend from heaven</em> with a shout, with the voice of the archangel, and with the trump of God: and the <em>dead in Christ shall rise first</em>: then we which are alive and remain shall be <em>caught up together with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air</em>: and so shall we ever be with the Lord.</p>
</blockquote><figcaption>— 1 Thessalonians 4:16-17</figcaption></figure><p>The Bible teaches that those who have died in Christ will be resurrected, and together with the living who are ready for His return, will be caught up to meet Him in the air to spend a <a href="/prophecy/millennium/">thousand years in heaven</a>. Because He remains in the air and does not touch the earth, His coming will not be an earthly appearance, but one in the sky—an important detail that helps us identify counterfeit christs (<a href="https://bible-api.com/Matthew%2024%3A4-5?translation=kjv" class="verse-link" data-reference="Matthew 24:4-5" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Matthew 24:4-5</a>). Put simply, if anyone—even an angel—appears on the earth and claims to be Christ, we can be certain this contradicts Scripture, for Paul plainly states that the redeemed will meet Jesus in the air, meaning He will remain in the clouds above the earth.</p><p>This is confirmed by the two angels’ declaration at Christ’s ascension: “This same Jesus, which is taken up from you into heaven, shall so come in like manner as ye have seen him go into heaven” (<a href="https://bible-api.com/Acts%201%3A11?translation=kjv" class="verse-link" data-reference="Acts 1:11" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Acts 1:11</a>). In other words, just as He ascended into heaven, He will likewise descend from heaven at His Second Coming.</p></section>

For this corruptible must put on incorruption, and this mortal must put on immortality</em>. So when this corruptible shall have put on incorruption, and this mortal shall have put on immortality, then shall be brought to pass the saying that is written, Death is swallowed up in victory.</p>

</blockquote><figcaption>— Isaiah 25:9</figcaption></figure><p>Christ’s coming will either be the best day of one’s life or the worst. Those who have loved Him enough to surrender their hearts to Him and submit to His will, through the power of the Holy Spirit (<a href="https://bible-api.com/1%20Corinthians%206%3A11?translation=kjv" class="verse-link" data-reference="1 Corinthians 6:11" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">1 Corinthians 6:11</a>), will rejoice at His appearing because He has become their best Friend and Lord of their lives.</p></section>

<p>And the heaven departed as a scroll when it is rolled together; and every mountain and island were moved out of their places. And the kings of the earth, and the great men, and the rich men, and the chief captains, and the mighty men, and every bondman, and every free man, <em>hid themselves</em> in the dens and in the rocks of the mountains; and said to the mountains and rocks, <em>Fall on us, and hide us from the face of him that sitteth on the throne, and from the wrath of the Lamb</em>: for the great day of his wrath is come; and who shall be able to stand?</p>
</blockquote><figcaption>— Revelation 6:14-17</figcaption></figure><p>In contrast to those who are saved, the lost—who had a superficial Christianity that never moved beyond mere profession, never surrendering all that they had and were to Him (<a href="https://bible-api.com/Matthew%207%3A21-23?translation=kjv" class="verse-link" data-reference="Matthew 7:21-23" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Matthew 7:21-23</a>)—will experience no peace or joy at Christ’s coming. To them, His coming will be a terrifying experience, so much so that they will seek death rather than face their Creator. Because they have chosen to cling to sin, they will be destroyed by the brightness of His coming, for anyone who holds on to sin cannot live in the presence of a holy God.</p><p>Sin will be destroyed by Christ one way or another, because it is a manifestation of selfishness, which has no place in His kingdom of love. The only question is: will we be destroyed with it? He can either purge us <em>from</em> our sins now (<a href="https://bible-api.com/Malachi%203%3A3?translation=kjv" class="verse-link" data-reference="Malachi 3:3" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Malachi 3:3</a>), as we invite Him to take over our lives, or He will purge us along <em>with</em> our sins at His coming. But how can we be washed now? By His Word! When we read the Bible, it begins to read us (<a href="https://bible-api.com/Hebrews%204%3A2?translation=kjv" class="verse-link" data-reference="Hebrews 4:2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hebrews 4:2</a>), bringing conviction that, if yielded to, will cleanse us from sin (<a href="https://bible-api.com/Ephesians%205%3A26?translation=kjv" class="verse-link" data-reference="Ephesians 5:26" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ephesians 5:26</a>). But if we neglect it, that same conviction will come at His appearing—at which point it will be too late to do anything about it. Now is the time to come to know Christ through His Word and to be transformed by His grace.</p></section>

<p>He answered and said unto them, He that soweth the good seed is the Son of man; the field is the world; the good seed are the children of the kingdom; but the tares are the children of the wicked one; the enemy that sowed them is the devil; the harvest is the end of the world; and the reapers are the angels. As therefore the tares are gathered and burned in the fire; so shall it be in the end of this world. The Son of man shall send forth his angels, and <em>they shall gather out of his kingdom all things that offend, and them which do iniquity</em>; and shall cast them into a furnace of fire: there shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth. Then shall the righteous shine forth as the sun in the kingdom of their Father. Who hath ears to hear, let him hear.</p>

<p>And there shall in no wise enter into it <em>any thing that defileth, neither whatsoever worketh abomination, or maketh a lie</em>: but they which are written in the Lamb’s book of life.</p>
</blockquote><figcaption>— Revelation 21:27</figcaption></figure><p>Because heaven is a place where righteousness dwells, anyone who clings to sin cannot be happy there. Excluding those who have repeatedly resisted God’s wooing grace and chosen to persist in sin is, in fact, an act of mercy toward the unconverted, for heaven would be a place of torment to those who have no longing for righteousness. It also secures the eternal peace and happiness of the citizens of God’s everlasting kingdom, for the removal of sin means the end of the pain, suffering, and misery that it always brings.</p></section>

By then, it will be too late to change sides, for He will return with His reward, showing that judgment has already taken place and every case has been decided. In fact, the citizens of God’s eternal kingdom will have been determined when probation closes, which happens before His Second Coming—just as the door of Noah’s ark was shut seven days before the rain began (<a href="https://bible-api.com/Genesis%207%3A10?translation=kjv" class="verse-link" data-reference="Genesis 7:10" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Genesis 7:10</a>).</p></section>

<p>And I saw heaven opened, and behold a white horse; and he that sat upon him was called Faithful and True, and in righteousness he doth judge and make war. His eyes were as a flame of fire, and <em>on his head were many crowns</em>; and he had a name written, that no man knew, but he himself. And he was clothed with a vesture dipped in blood: and his name is called The Word of God. And <em>the armies which were in heaven followed him upon white horses</em>, clothed in fine linen, white and clean. And out of his mouth goeth a sharp sword, that with it he should smite the nations: and he shall rule them with a rod of iron: and he treadeth the winepress of the fierceness and wrath of Almighty God. And he hath on his vesture and on his thigh a name written, <em>KING OF KINGS, AND LORD OF LORDS</em>.</p>

<p>And the seventh angel poured out his vial into the air; and there came a great voice out of the temple of heaven, from the throne, saying, It is done. And there were voices, and thunders, and lightnings; and <em>there was a great earthquake</em>, such as was not since men were upon the earth, so mighty an earthquake, and so great. And the great city was divided into three parts, and the cities of the nations fell: and great Babylon came in remembrance before God, to give unto her the cup of the wine of the fierceness of his wrath. And <em>every island fled away, and the mountains were not found. And there fell upon men a great hail</em> out of heaven, every stone about the weight of a talent: and men blasphemed God because of the plague of the hail; for the plague thereof was exceeding great.</p>

<p>I beheld the earth, and, lo, <em>it was without form, and void</em>; and the heavens, and they had no light. I beheld the mountains, and, lo, they trembled, and all the hills moved lightly. I beheld, and, lo, <em>there was no man, and all the birds of the heavens were fled</em>. I beheld, and, lo, the <em>fruitful place was a wilderness</em>, and <em>all the cities thereof were broken down</em> at the presence of the LORD, and by his fierce anger.

<p>And the <em>slain of the LORD shall be at that day from one end of the earth even unto the other end of the earth: they shall not be lamented, neither gathered, nor buried</em>; they shall be dung upon the ground.</p>

<li id="fn1" class="footnote-item"><p>Proponents of the secret rapture theory believe the rapture will be followed by a seven-year tribulation, during which those who were not taken to heaven will have another opportunity to repent and be saved. But offering such a second chance makes God appear arbitrary and unfair, granting one group a new opportunity for salvation while denying it to others. Furthermore, the theory provides false security to those who wish to continue in sin, as they may presume they can repent during the tribulation. How devastating will it be when they realize there is no second chance and that they have squandered the only one they had? <a href="#fnref1" class="footnote-backref">↩︎</a></p>
