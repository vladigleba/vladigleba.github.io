</blockquote><figcaption>— 1 Thessalonians 4:16-17</figcaption></figure>

<p>Those who died in Christ will be resurrected and, together with those who are alive and ready for Christ, will be caught up to meet Him in the air. Because He will not touch the earth, His second coming will not be an earth appearance, but a sky appearance.</p>

And the kings of the earth, and the great men, and the rich men, and the chief captains, and the mighty men, and every bondman, and every free man, <em>hid themselves</em> in the dens and in the rocks of the mountains; and said to the mountains and rocks, <em>Fall on us, and hide us from the face of him that sitteth on the throne, and from the wrath of the Lamb</em>: for the great day of his wrath is come; and who shall be able to stand?</p>

<p>And then shall that Wicked be revealed, whom the Lord shall consume with the spirit of his mouth, and shall <em>destroy with the brightness of his coming</em>.</p>
</blockquote><figcaption>— 2 Thessalonians 2:8</figcaption></figure>

<p>Those who are left behind are destroyed by the brightness of His coming because any person who clings to sin cannot live in the presence of a holy God. To them His coming is a terrifying experience.</p>

As therefore the tares are gathered and burned in the fire; so shall it be in the end of this world. The Son of man shall send forth his angels, and <em>they shall gather out of his kingdom all things that offend, and them which do iniquity</em>; and shall cast them into a furnace of fire: there shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth. Then shall the righteous shine forth as the sun in the kingdom of their Father. Who hath ears to hear, let him hear.</p>

<figure><blockquote>
<p>Nevertheless we, according to his promise, look for new heavens and a new earth, <em>wherein dwelleth righteousness</em>.</p>

</blockquote><figcaption>— Revelation 22:11-12</figcaption></figure>

<p>When Jesus returns there will be only two groups of people—the saved and the lost. It will also be too late to change sides because He returns with His reward, meaning the judgment has already happened and every person’s case has been decided.</p>

His eyes were as a flame of fire, and <em>on his head were many crowns</em>; and he had a name written, that no man knew, but he himself. And he was clothed with a vesture dipped in blood: and his name is called The Word of God. And <em>the armies which were in heaven followed him upon white horses</em>, clothed in fine linen, white and clean. And out of his mouth goeth a sharp sword, that with it he should smite the nations: and he shall rule them with a rod of iron: and he treadeth the winepress of the fierceness and wrath of Almighty God. And he hath on his vesture and on his thigh a name written, <em>KING OF KINGS, AND LORD OF LORDS</em>.</p>
</blockquote><figcaption>— Revelation 19:11-16</figcaption></figure>

<p>Because He has won the war with Satan, Jesus comes back as a victorious King surrounded by His angelic army.</p>
