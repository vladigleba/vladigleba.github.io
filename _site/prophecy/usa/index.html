He does not want anyone to be lost because of a lack of knowledge about eternal realities, so He often speaks through prophets to make these truths known to His people.

<p>And I stood upon the sand of the sea, and <em>saw a beast rise up out of the sea, having seven heads and ten horns, and upon his horns ten crowns, and upon his heads the name of blasphemy</em>. And the beast which I saw was like unto a leopard, and his feet were as the feet of a bear, and his mouth as the mouth of a lion: and the dragon gave him his power, and his seat, and great authority. And I saw one of his heads as it were wounded to death; and his deadly wound was healed: and all the world wondered after the beast. And they worshipped the dragon which gave power unto the beast: and they worshipped the beast, saying, Who is like unto the beast? who is able to make war with him? And there was given unto him a mouth speaking great things and blasphemies; and <em>power was given unto him to continue forty and two months</em>. And he opened his mouth in blasphemy against God, to blaspheme his name, and his tabernacle, and them that dwell in heaven.</p>
<p>And it was given unto him to make war with the saints, and to overcome them: and power was given him over all kindreds, and tongues, and nations. And all that dwell upon the earth shall worship him, whose names are not written in the book of life of the Lamb slain from the foundation of the world. If any man have an ear, let him hear.

The papacy received a <a href="/prophecy/mark/">deadly wound</a> at the end of this period in 1798, when Pope Pius VI was taken captive by Napoleon Bonaparte’s general, Louis-Alexandre Berthier.</p><p data-search-id="paragraph-2">By the way, the beast represented in <a href="https://bible-api.com/Revelation%2013%3A2?translation=kjv" class="verse-link" data-reference="Revelation 13:2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Revelation 13:2</a> is a conglomerate of the <a href="/prophecy/antichrist/">four beasts</a> described in <a href="https://bible-api.com/Daniel%207%3A2-8?translation=kjv" class="verse-link" data-reference="Daniel 7:2-8" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Daniel 7:2-8</a>, because Catholicism has adopted the works-based religion of Babylon, the Persian system of government (based on the structure of Mithraism), the philosophy of Greece (for example, natural law and the elevation of reason), and the legal system of Rome (for example, canon law).</p></section>

There is only one power that fits this time frame—the United States. It declared its independence in 1776, adopted the Constitution in 1787, and ratified the Bill of Rights in 1791. By 1798, it was recognized as a rising global power. A key detail in verse 11 is that this power arises “out of the earth,” in contrast to the first beast, which came “out of the sea.” According to <a href="https://bible-api.com/Revelation%2017%3A15?translation=kjv" class="verse-link" data-reference="Revelation 17:15" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Revelation 17:15</a>, the sea symbolizes large, densely populated areas; therefore, the earth represents the opposite—a sparsely populated region. This means the second beast could not emerge from the crowded nations of the Old World; instead, it had to rise from a less populated part of the world—perfectly matching the emergence of the United States.</p></section>

</blockquote><figcaption>— Revelation 13:11</figcaption></figure><p data-search-id="paragraph-4">The lamb-like horns suggest youth and innocence, emphasizing that this would be a new nation. Horns, on the other hand, represent kings, kingdoms, or governing powers (<a href="https://bible-api.com/Daniel%207%3A24?translation=kjv" class="verse-link" data-reference="Daniel 7:24" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Daniel 7:24</a>; <a href="https://bible-api.com/Daniel%208%3A21?translation=kjv" class="verse-link" data-reference="Daniel 8:21" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">8:21</a>). In this case, they symbolize the two founding principles of the United States: civil and religious liberty. These principles have also been described as republicanism (a government without a king) and Protestantism (a church without a pope).<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">[1]</a></sup> Unlike other nations described in Daniel and Revelation, this one is distinguished by the absence of crowns, signifying a republican form of government as opposed to a monarchy.</p><p data-search-id="paragraph-5">Throughout history, it was common for nations to tax citizens to support a state religion and to oppress religious dissenters. The Pilgrims on the Mayflower, along with many other settlers who followed, were fleeing religious persecution, and so the United States was founded with an entirely new mindset: the separation of church and state. This idea, first brought to prominence by the German princes at the Diet of Speyer in 1529, found its fullest expression more than 250 years later when, in 1791, the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution was adopted. Yet the princes were not its originators; they were merely echoing what Jesus had taught long before, when He declared, “Render to Caesar the things that are Caesar’s, and to God the things that are God’s” (<a href="https://bible-api.com/Mark%2012%3A17?translation=kjv" class="verse-link" data-reference="Mark 12:17" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mark 12:17</a>). In upholding liberty of conscience, Protestantism provided the world with a foundation upon which the future freedom, happiness, and well-being of society could be built.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn2" id="fnref2">[2]</a></sup></p></section>

Since his rebellion in heaven, Satan’s aim has been to be like God—to usurp His authority and compel people to worship him instead (<a href="https://bible-api.com/Isaiah%2014%3A12-14?translation=kjv" class="verse-link" data-reference="Isaiah 14:12-14" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Isaiah 14:12-14</a>). So what does it mean for a nation to speak like a dragon? A nation “speaks” through its laws and legislative actions, so to speak like a dragon means that a time will come when the United States, under Satan’s influence, will enact laws enforcing false worship.</p><p data-search-id="paragraph-7">Not only will this be an abandonment of the nation’s duty to protect liberty of conscience for all its citizens—and thus a repudiation of the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution—but it will also be an act of blasphemy, for it will assume authority that belongs only to God. As our Creator, God alone has the authority to prescribe our duties to Him, and He has done so with the Ten Commandments. To enforce these duties by coercion, even if it is claimed to be for the good of society, creates a society of hypocrites who obey outwardly while the heart remains unconverted—the exact opposite of what God desires in His followers (<a href="https://bible-api.com/Deuteronomy%2030%3A6?translation=kjv" class="verse-link" data-reference="Deuteronomy 30:6" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Deuteronomy 30:6</a>; <a href="https://bible-api.com/Ezekiel%2036%3A26?translation=kjv" class="verse-link" data-reference="Ezekiel 36:26" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ezekiel 36:26</a>). The use of coercion has no power to regenerate the heart, and it is utterly repugnant to the God of love who gave Adam and Eve the freedom to walk away from Him—at infinite cost to Himself.</p></section>

</blockquote><figcaption>— Revelation 13:14-15</figcaption></figure><p data-search-id="paragraph-10">Abandoning its foundational principle of church-state separation, the United States will instead form an unholy union between civil government and apostate Protestantism. In doing so, it will make an image to the beast by establishing a copy of the church-state system used by the papacy during the Middle Ages, when millions were killed for their faith. These actions will appear spiritual, patriotic, and beneficial to society, but they will be satanic in nature—fitly represented by the lamb-like beast (<a href="https://bible-api.com/Revelation%2013%3A11?translation=kjv" class="verse-link" data-reference="Revelation 13:11" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Revelation 13:11</a>).

It will begin mildly but will eventually escalate, forcing people to comply or face persecution and, ultimately, death. Once this church-state union is formed domestically, the U.S. will pressure other nations to follow its example, leading the entire world to wonder after the beast (<a href="https://bible-api.com/Revelation%2013%3A3?translation=kjv" class="verse-link" data-reference="Revelation 13:3" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Revelation 13:3</a>).</p><p data-search-id="paragraph-11">There are a couple of additional details worth noting. The deceptive miracle-working described above is a religious activity, which means it is carried out by the apostate Protestant side of the church-state union. These miracles then empower the deception, persuading those who dwell on the earth to make an image to the beast. Notably, the image is <em>made</em>, indicating that it did not exist originally, so this can only apply to a nation that had no church-state union at its founding. Moreover, it is the <em>people</em> dwelling on the earth who make an image to the beast. This suggests a representative form of government, one that is “of the people, by the people, and for the people.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn3" id="fnref3">[3]</a></sup> In other words, it will be the people, urged on by the apostate Protestant churches, who will demand religious laws from their representatives in Congress.</p></section>

The oppressed and downtrodden throughout Christendom have turned to this land with interest and hope.

<li id="fn2" class="footnote-item" data-search-id="footnote-1"><p>Closely related to liberty of conscience is the authority of the Bible above that of the Church: “The principles contained in the celebrated Protest of the 19th of April, 1529, constitute the very essence of Protestantism. Now this Protest opposes two abuses of man in matters of faith: the first is the intrusion of the civil magistrate, and the second the arbitrary authority of the church. Instead of these abuses, Protestantism sets the power of conscience above the magistrate, and the authority of the word of God above the visible church. In the first place, it rejects the civil power in divine things, and says with the prophets and apostles, ‘We must obey God rather than man.’ In presence of the crown of Charles the Fifth, it uplifts the crown of Jesus Christ. But it goes farther: it lays down the principle that all human teaching should be subordinate to the oracles of God.” —Merle d’Aubigné, <em>History of the Reformation</em>, Book 13, Chapter 6, Paragraph 18. <a href="#fnref2" class="footnote-backref">↩︎</a></p>

<li id="fn8" class="footnote-item" data-search-id="footnote-7"><p>Of course, there is nothing inherently wrong with unity. After all, Jesus teaches us to love our neighbors—even our enemies—and He prayed for unity among His disciples (<a href="https://bible-api.com/Matthew%2022%3A39?translation=kjv" class="verse-link" data-reference="Matthew 22:39" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Matthew 22:39</a>; <a href="https://bible-api.com/Matthew%205%3A44?translation=kjv" class="verse-link" data-reference="Matthew 5:44" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">5:44</a>; <a href="https://bible-api.com/John%2017%3A11?translation=kjv" class="verse-link" data-reference="John 17:11" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">John 17:11</a>).

<li id="fn12" class="footnote-item" data-search-id="footnote-11"><p>It may seem improbable that people’s eternal destiny will be determined by the day they choose to observe, but God often uses simple means to test our loyalty; affter all, Adam and Eve were expelled from the Garden for eating fruit from the wrong tree. Of course, the fruit was merely the means of settling a far greater issue—trust. Would Adam and Eve trust God or Satan? In the same way, the day of worship will represent the far greater issue of <em>authority</em>.

<li id="fn13" class="footnote-item" data-search-id="footnote-12"><p>Incidentally, both interpretations were introduced by Roman Catholic Jesuits: Preterism by Luis de Alcázar and Futurism by Francisco Ribera. Preterism holds that the prophecies of Revelation were fulfilled in the past, prior to the rise of the papacy, while Futurism teaches that the Antichrist—understood as a future <em>individual</em>—will appear after the literal rebuilding of the Third Temple in Jerusalem. Futurism is especially popular in some circles in Washington, D.C., and appears to be influencing, at least in part, national policy regarding Israel. <a href="#fnref13" class="footnote-backref">↩︎</a></p>
