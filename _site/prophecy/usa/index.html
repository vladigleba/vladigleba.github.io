He does not want anyone to be lost because of a lack of knowledge about eternal realities, so He often speaks through prophets to make these truths known to His people.

<p>And I stood upon the sand of the sea, and <em>saw a beast rise up out of the sea, having seven heads and ten horns, and upon his horns ten crowns, and upon his heads the name of blasphemy</em>. And the beast which I saw was like unto a leopard, and his feet were as the feet of a bear, and his mouth as the mouth of a lion: and the dragon gave him his power, and his seat, and great authority. And I saw one of his heads as it were wounded to death; and his deadly wound was healed: and all the world wondered after the beast. And they worshipped the dragon which gave power unto the beast: and they worshipped the beast, saying, Who is like unto the beast? who is able to make war with him? And there was given unto him a mouth speaking great things and blasphemies; and <em>power was given unto him to continue forty and two months</em>. And he opened his mouth in blasphemy against God, to blaspheme his name, and his tabernacle, and them that dwell in heaven.</p>
<p>And it was given unto him to make war with the saints, and to overcome them: and power was given him over all kindreds, and tongues, and nations. And all that dwell upon the earth shall worship him, whose names are not written in the book of life of the Lamb slain from the foundation of the world. If any man have an ear, let him hear. He that leadeth into captivity shall go into captivity: he that killeth with the sword must be killed with the sword. Here is the patience and the faith of the saints.</p>
</blockquote><figcaption>— Revelation 13:1-10</figcaption></figure><p>As we learned in a previous study, the beast that rose from the sea represents the Roman papacy, which held influence and power over the world for 42 months. The papacy received a <a href="/prophecy/mark/">deadly wound</a> at the end of this period in 1798, when Pope Pius VI was taken captive by Napoleon Bonaparte’s general, Louis-Alexandre Berthier.</p><p>By the way, the beast represented in <a href="https://bible-api.com/Revelation%2013%3A2?translation=kjv" class="verse-link" data-reference="Revelation 13:2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Revelation 13:2</a> is a conglomerate of the <a href="/prophecy/antichrist/">four beasts</a> described in <a href="https://bible-api.com/Daniel%207%3A2-8?translation=kjv" class="verse-link" data-reference="Daniel 7:2-8" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Daniel 7:2-8</a>, because Catholicism has adopted the works-based religion of Babylon, the Persian system of government (based on the structure of Mithraism), the philosophy of Greece (for example, natural law and the elevation of reason), and the legal system of Rome (for example, canon law).</p></section>

<p>And I beheld another beast <em>coming up out of the earth</em>; and he had two horns like a lamb, and he spake as a dragon.</p>

There is only one power that fits this time frame—the United States. It declared its independence in 1776, adopted the Constitution in 1787, and ratified the Bill of Rights in 1791. By 1798, it was recognized as a rising global power. A key detail in verse 11 is that this power arises “out of the earth,” in contrast to the first beast, which came “out of the sea.” According to <a href="https://bible-api.com/Revelation%2017%3A15?translation=kjv" class="verse-link" data-reference="Revelation 17:15" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Revelation 17:15</a>, the sea symbolizes large, densely populated areas; therefore, the earth represents the opposite—a sparsely populated region. This means the second beast could not emerge from the crowded nations of the Old World; instead, it had to rise from a less populated part of the world—perfectly matching the emergence of the United States.</p></section>

<p>And I beheld another beast coming up out of the earth; and he had <em>two horns like a lamb</em>, and he spake as a dragon.</p>
</blockquote><figcaption>— Revelation 13:11</figcaption></figure><p>The lamb-like horns suggest youth and innocence, emphasizing that this would be a new nation. Horns, on the other hand, represent kings, kingdoms, or governing powers (<a href="https://bible-api.com/Daniel%207%3A24?translation=kjv" class="verse-link" data-reference="Daniel 7:24" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Daniel 7:24</a>; <a href="https://bible-api.com/Daniel%208%3A21?translation=kjv" class="verse-link" data-reference="Daniel 8:21" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">8:21</a>). In this case, they symbolize the two founding principles of the United States: civil and religious liberty. These principles have also been described as republicanism (a government without a king) and Protestantism (a church without a pope).<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">[1]</a></sup> Unlike other nations described in Daniel and Revelation, this one is distinguished by the absence of crowns, signifying a republican form of government as opposed to a monarchy.</p><p>Throughout history, it was common for nations to tax citizens to support a state religion and to oppress religious dissenters. The Pilgrims on the Mayflower, along with many other settlers who followed, were fleeing religious persecution, and so the United States was founded with an entirely new mindset: the separation of church and state. This idea, first brought to prominence by the German princes at the Diet of Speyer in 1529, found its fullest expression more than 250 years later when, in 1791, the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution was adopted. Yet the princes were not its originators; they were merely echoing what Jesus had taught long before, when He declared, “Render to Caesar the things that are Caesar’s, and to God the things that are God’s” (<a href="https://bible-api.com/Mark%2012%3A17?translation=kjv" class="verse-link" data-reference="Mark 12:17" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mark 12:17</a>). In upholding liberty of conscience, Protestantism provided the world with a foundation upon which the future freedom, happiness, and well-being of society could be built.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn2" id="fnref2">[2]</a></sup></p></section>

Since his rebellion in heaven, Satan’s aim has been to be like God—to usurp His authority and compel people to worship him instead (<a href="https://bible-api.com/Isaiah%2014%3A12-14?translation=kjv" class="verse-link" data-reference="Isaiah 14:12-14" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Isaiah 14:12-14</a>). So what does it mean for a nation to speak like a dragon? A nation “speaks” through its laws and legislative actions, so to speak like a dragon means that a time will come when the United States, under Satan’s influence, will enact laws enforcing false worship.</p><p>Not only will this be an abandonment of the nation’s duty to protect liberty of conscience for all its citizens—and thus a repudiation of the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution—but it will also be an act of blasphemy, for it will assume authority that belongs only to God. As our Creator, God alone has the authority to prescribe our duties to Him, and He has done so with the Ten Commandments. To enforce these duties by coercion, even if it is claimed to be for the good of society, creates a society of hypocrites who obey outwardly while the heart remains unconverted—the exact opposite of what God desires in His followers (<a href="https://bible-api.com/Deuteronomy%2030%3A6?translation=kjv" class="verse-link" data-reference="Deuteronomy 30:6" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Deuteronomy 30:6</a>; <a href="https://bible-api.com/Ezekiel%2036%3A26?translation=kjv" class="verse-link" data-reference="Ezekiel 36:26" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ezekiel 36:26</a>). The use of coercion has no power to regenerate the heart, and it is utterly repugnant to the God of love who gave Adam and Eve the freedom to walk away from Him—at infinite cost to Himself.</p></section>

<p>And he <em>exerciseth all the power of the first beast</em> before him, and <em>causeth the earth and them which dwell therein to worship the first beast</em>, whose deadly wound was healed. And he <em>doeth great wonders, so that he maketh fire come down from heaven on the earth</em> in the sight of men, and <em>deceiveth them that dwell on the earth by the means of those miracles</em> which he had power to do in the sight of the beast; saying to them that dwell on the earth, that they should make an image to the beast, which had the wound by a sword, and did live.</p>
</blockquote><figcaption>— Revelation 13:12-14</figcaption></figure><p>The United States will exercise all the authority of the first beast, the papacy, meaning it will imitate its actions, becoming a persecuting power that compels individuals to act against their conscience. The passage goes on to say that the United States will use its influence to lead other nations to do the same. Clearly, worship will be the central issue in the last days. Every individual will be faced with the question: <em>Will I worship my Creator and Redeemer, Jesus Christ, or the antichrist?</em></p><p>The call to align with the antichrist will <em>appear</em> genuinely spiritual, being backed by miracles that will deceive many. Religious fanaticism will run high, causing those who refuse to comply to be labeled divisive, stubborn, legalistic, and unpatriotic. Though this may seem shocking and outlandish, Jesus does not lie, and His words never fail (<a href="https://bible-api.com/Titus%201%3A2?translation=kjv" class="verse-link" data-reference="Titus 1:2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Titus 1:2</a>).

And he had power to give life unto the image of the beast, that the image of the beast should both speak, and cause that as many as would not worship the image of the beast should be killed.</p>
</blockquote><figcaption>— Revelation 13:14-15</figcaption></figure><p>Abandoning its foundational principle of church-state separation, the United States will instead form an unholy union between civil government and apostate Protestantism. In doing so, it will make an image to the beast by establishing a copy of the church-state system used by the papacy during the Middle Ages, when millions were killed for their faith. These actions will appear spiritual, patriotic, and beneficial to society, but they will be satanic in nature—fitly represented by the lamb-like beast (<a href="https://bible-api.com/Revelation%2013%3A11?translation=kjv" class="verse-link" data-reference="Revelation 13:11" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Revelation 13:11</a>). With apostate Protestantism in control of the government, religious legislation will soon follow (<a href="https://bible-api.com/Revelation%2013%3A15?translation=kjv" class="verse-link" data-reference="Revelation 13:15" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Revelation 13:15</a>). It will begin mildly but will eventually escalate, forcing people to comply or face persecution and, ultimately, death. Once this church-state union is formed domestically, the U.S. will pressure other nations to follow its example, leading the entire world to wonder after the beast (<a href="https://bible-api.com/Revelation%2013%3A3?translation=kjv" class="verse-link" data-reference="Revelation 13:3" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Revelation 13:3</a>).</p><p>There are a couple of additional details worth noting. The deceptive miracle-working described above is a religious activity, which means it is carried out by the apostate Protestant side of the church-state union. These miracles then empower the deception, persuading those who dwell on the earth to make an image to the beast. Notably, the image is <em>made</em>, indicating that it did not exist originally, so this can only apply to a nation that had no church-state union at its founding.

In the landmark 1892 case <em>Church of the Holy Trinity v. United States</em>, the Supreme Court declared the United States a Christian nation, thereby setting a precedent that would justify future religious legislation. <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn5" id="fnref5">[5]</a></sup> That same year, Congress passed legislation requiring the World’s Columbian Exposition to close on Sundays in honor of Sunday observance, a mandate endorsed by President Benjamin Harrison, who made government funding for the fair conditional on Sunday closure. As a result, only 101 years after the ratification of the First Amendment, which established the separation of church and state, all three branches of the United States government had effectively repudiated that principle. Today, many states already have “blue laws” that restrict commerce on Sundays, based on the Supreme Court’s 1961 ruling in <em>McGowan v.

<p>He that dwelleth in the secret place of the most High shall abide under the shadow of the Almighty. I will say of the LORD, <em>He is my refuge and my fortress: my God; in him will I trust</em>. Surely he shall deliver thee from the snare of the fowler, and from the noisome pestilence. He shall cover thee with his feathers, and under his wings shalt thou trust: <em>his truth shall be thy shield and buckler</em>. Thou shalt not be afraid for the terror by night; nor for the arrow that flieth by day; nor for the pestilence that walketh in darkness; nor for the destruction that wasteth at noonday. A thousand shall fall at thy side, and ten thousand at thy right hand; but it shall not come nigh thee. Only with thine eyes shalt thou behold and see the reward of the wicked.</p>
<p>Because thou hast made the LORD, which is my refuge, even the most High, thy habitation; there shall no evil befall thee, neither shall any plague come nigh thy dwelling. <em>For he shall give his angels charge over thee, to keep thee in all thy ways</em>. They shall bear thee up in their hands, lest thou dash thy foot against a stone. Thou shalt tread upon the lion and adder: the young lion and the dragon shalt thou trample under feet. Because he hath set his love upon me, therefore will I deliver him: I will set him on high, because he hath known my name. <em>He shall call upon me, and I will answer him: I will be with him in trouble; I will deliver him</em>, and honour him. With long life will I satisfy him, and shew him my salvation.</p>

<li id="fn1" class="footnote-item"><p>These two principles—civil and religious liberty—“are the secret of its [the United States'] power and prosperity. The oppressed and downtrodden throughout Christendom have turned to this land with interest and hope. Millions have sought its shores, and the United States has risen to a place among the most powerful nations of the earth.” Ellen G. White, <em>The Great Controversy</em>, p. 441 <a href="#fnref1" class="footnote-backref">↩︎</a></p>

<li id="fn2" class="footnote-item"><p>Closely related to liberty of conscience is the authority of the Bible above that of the Church: “The principles contained in the celebrated Protest of the 19th of April, 1529, constitute the very essence of Protestantism. Now this Protest opposes two abuses of man in matters of faith: the first is the intrusion of the civil magistrate, and the second the arbitrary authority of the church. Instead of these abuses, Protestantism sets the power of conscience above the magistrate, and the authority of the word of God above the visible church. In the first place, it rejects the civil power in divine things, and says with the prophets and apostles, ‘We must obey God rather than man.’ In presence of the crown of Charles the Fifth, it uplifts the crown of Jesus Christ. But it goes farther: it lays down the principle that all human teaching should be subordinate to the oracles of God.” —Merle d’Aubigné, <em>History of the Reformation</em>, Book 13, Chapter 6, Paragraph 18. <a href="#fnref2" class="footnote-backref">↩︎</a></p>

<li id="fn8" class="footnote-item"><p>Of course, there is nothing inherently wrong with unity. After all, Jesus teaches us to love our neighbors—even our enemies—and He prayed for unity among His disciples (<a href="https://bible-api.com/Matthew%2022%3A39?translation=kjv" class="verse-link" data-reference="Matthew 22:39" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Matthew 22:39</a>; <a href="https://bible-api.com/Matthew%205%3A44?translation=kjv" class="verse-link" data-reference="Matthew 5:44" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">5:44</a>; <a href="https://bible-api.com/John%2017%3A11?translation=kjv" class="verse-link" data-reference="John 17:11" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">John 17:11</a>). Unity is indeed biblical, so long as it is not built on the compromise of truth as revealed in God’s Word. Unfortunately, this is often <a href="/gospel/salvation/#how-exactly-am-i-saved-from-my-sins">not the case</a>. <a href="#fnref8" class="footnote-backref">↩︎</a></p>

<li id="fn11" class="footnote-item"><p>It has become common in public discourse to dismiss—nay, to denigrate—God’s Sabbath by referring to it as the “Jewish Sabbath.” Yet the truth remains: there was not a single Jew in the Garden of Eden when God instituted it. <a href="#fnref11" class="footnote-backref">↩︎</a></p>
</li>
<li id="fn12" class="footnote-item"><p>It may seem improbable that people’s eternal destiny will be determined by the day they choose to observe, but God often uses simple means to test our loyalty; affter all, Adam and Eve were expelled from the Garden for eating fruit from the wrong tree. Of course, the fruit was merely the means of settling a far greater issue—trust. Would Adam and Eve trust God or Satan? In the same way, the day of worship will represent the far greater issue of <em>authority</em>. Every person will have to decide: Whom will I acknowledge as the ultimate authority over my life—God or Satan? <a href="#fnref12" class="footnote-backref">↩︎</a></p>
</li>
<li id="fn13" class="footnote-item"><p>Incidentally, both interpretations were introduced by Roman Catholic Jesuits: Preterism by Luis de Alcázar and Futurism by Francisco Ribera. Preterism holds that the prophecies of Revelation were fulfilled in the past, prior to the rise of the papacy, while Futurism teaches that the Antichrist—understood as a future <em>individual</em>—will appear after the literal rebuilding of the Third Temple in Jerusalem. Futurism is especially popular in conservative religious circles in Washington, D.C., and appears to be influencing, at least in part, national policy regarding Israel. <a href="#fnref13" class="footnote-backref">↩︎</a></p>
