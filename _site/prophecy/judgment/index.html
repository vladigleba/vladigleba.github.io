In Revelation 14, on the other hand, there are three angels proclaiming a message to the people of the world in the last days, and the first angel’s message is that the judgment has begun. So the judgment <a href="/prophecy/investigative/">begins in the last days</a>, which we are living in. When Jesus comes back to earth He’s bringing a reward with Him, which means the judgment has already taken place to decide who will be saved and what their reward will be.</p></section>

<p>And take heed to yourselves, lest at any time your hearts be overcharged with <em>surfeiting, and drunkenness, and cares of this life</em>, and so that day come upon you unawares.</p>
</blockquote><figcaption>— Luke 21:34</figcaption></figure><figure><blockquote>
<p>For the Son of man is as a man taking a far journey, who left his house, and gave authority to his servants, and to every man his work, and commanded the porter to watch. Watch ye therefore: for ye know not when the master of the house cometh, at even, or at midnight, or at the cockcrowing, or in the morning: <em>Lest coming suddenly he find you sleeping</em>.</p>
</blockquote><figcaption>— Mark 13:34-36</figcaption></figure><p>Jesus warned about four specific things:</p><ul>
<li><em>Surfeiting</em>: This means “excess,” and it can be anything that disturbs balance and violates the principle of temperance (<a href="https://bible-api.com/Galatians%205%3A22-25?translation=kjv" class="verse-link" data-reference="Galatians 5:22-25" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Galatians 5:22-25</a>), such as overeating, overwork, or even recreation, which is very beneficial when done it moderation.</li>
<li><em>Drunkenness</em>: This is anything that brings about a spiritual stupor, destroys clear thinking, and removes our desire for heavenly things. Examples include pornography, alcoholism, illicit sex, worldly entertainment, and so on, because they lead to living in a dream world.</li>
<li><em>Cares of this life</em>: These are perfectly fine activities that are a part of life, but when they take over our lives they take time away from Jesus and shift our focus away from eternal realities, leading to less time spent in prayer, studying His word, and being an active member of His church.</li>
<li><em>Sleeping</em>: Jesus is referring to spiritually asleep here, and this involves taking the Bible and the truth it reveals about Him for granted. It’s being indifferent about our relationship with Jesus and neglecting the principles of His kingdom (<a href="https://bible-api.com/2%20Timothy%203%3A5?translation=kjv" class="verse-link" data-reference="2 Timothy 3:5" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2 Timothy 3:5</a>). In <a href="https://bible-api.com/Revelation%203%3A15-19?translation=kjv" class="verse-link" data-reference="Revelation 3:15-19" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Revelation 3:15-19</a> it’s described as being lukewarm—being falsely satisfied with one’s own spiritual condition and not being actively involved in the work of Jesus. Perhaps the biggest problem with sleep is being unaware that one is asleep! But the good news is Jesus still patiently knocks at the door of the heart. Have you let Him in?</li>
