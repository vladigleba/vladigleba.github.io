<figure><blockquote>
<p>Wherefore the children of Israel shall keep the sabbath, to observe the sabbath throughout their generations, for a <em>perpetual covenant</em>. It is a sign between me and the children of Israel <em>for ever</em>: for in six days the LORD made heaven and earth, and on the seventh day he rested, and was refreshed. And he gave unto Moses, when he had made an end of communing with him upon mount Sinai, two tables of testimony, <em>tables of stone</em>, written with the finger of God.</p>
</blockquote><figcaption>— Exodus 31:16-18</figcaption></figure>

<p>The Ten Commandments, which the Sabbath is a part of, were written by the finger of God on tablets of stone, instead of a material subject to decay, like wood or clay, as a testament to their timelessness. This is in contrast to Jesus writing the sins of the woman caught in adultery in the dust (<a href="https://bible-api.com/John%208%3A1-11?translation=kjv" class="verse-link" data-reference="John 8:1-11" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">John 8:1-11</a>), as a beautiful testament to God’s willingness to forgive anyone who repents.</p>

<figure><blockquote>
<p>Thus the heavens and the earth were finished, and all the host of them. And on the seventh day God ended his work which he had made; and <em>he rested on the seventh day</em> from all his work which he had made. And <em>God blessed the seventh day, and sanctified it</em>: because that in it he had rested from all his work which God created and made.</p>
</blockquote><figcaption>— Genesis 2:1-3</figcaption></figure>

<figure><blockquote>
<p>For as the new heavens and the new earth, which I will make, shall remain before me, saith the LORD, so shall your seed and your name remain. And it shall come to pass, that from one new moon to another, and <em>from one sabbath to another, shall all flesh come to worship before me</em>, saith the LORD.</p>
</blockquote><figcaption>— Isaiah 66:22, 23</figcaption></figure>

<p>The seventh day Sabbath, from Friday sunset to Saturday sunset, was set apart, blessed, and sanctified on the very first week of creation, long before there was a Jewish nation, and it will be kept even in heaven.</p>

<p>Moreover also I gave them my sabbaths, to be a sign between me and them, that <em>they might know that I am the LORD that sanctify them</em>.</p>
</blockquote><figcaption>— Ezekiel 20:12</figcaption></figure>

<p>Because all have sinned, everyone is in need of the sanctifying power of Christ, which the Sabbath is a sign of, so naturally, the Sabbath is a perpetual sign for everyone.</p>

<figure><blockquote>
<p>For he spake in a certain place of the seventh day on this wise, and God did rest the seventh day from all his works. And in this place again, If they shall enter into my rest. Seeing therefore it remaineth that some must enter therein, and <em>they to whom it was first preached entered not in because of unbelief</em> ... There remaineth therefore a rest to the people of God. For he that is entered into his rest, he also hath ceased from his own works, as God did from his. <em>Let us labour therefore to enter into that rest, lest any man fall after the same example of unbelief</em>.</p>
</blockquote><figcaption>— Hebrews 4:4-6, 9-11</figcaption></figure>

<p>The book of Hebrews says there was unbelief about resting on the seventh day, but to deny this day is to deny salvation by faith. Because I cannot sanctify or save myself, I am invited to cease from trying to be saved by my own works and rest in the righteous life of Jesus on my behalf. Resting on the seventh day of the week, as God did in <a href="https://bible-api.com/Genesis%202%3A1-3?translation=kjv" class="verse-link" data-reference="Genesis 2:1-3" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Genesis 2:1-3</a>, is an acknowledgment of this sublime truth.</p>

<p>And that day was the preparation, and the sabbath drew on. And the women also, which came with him from Galilee, followed after, and beheld the sepulchre, and how his body was laid.

<figure><blockquote>
<p>Now upon the <em>first day of the week</em>, very early in the morning, <em>they came unto the sepulchre</em>, bringing the spices which they had prepared, and certain others with them.</p>
</blockquote><figcaption>— Luke 24:1</figcaption></figure>

<figure><blockquote>
<p>In the end of the sabbath, as it began to dawn toward the <em>first day of the week, came Mary Magdalene and the other Mary to see the sepulchre</em>.</p>
</blockquote><figcaption>— Matthew 28:1</figcaption></figure>

<figure><blockquote>
<p>And very early in the morning the <em>first day of the week, they came unto the sepulchre</em> at the rising of the sun.</p>
</blockquote><figcaption>— Mark 16:2</figcaption></figure>

<figure><blockquote>
<p>The <em>first day of the week cometh Mary Magdalene early, when it was yet dark, unto the sepulchre</em>, and seeth the stone taken away from the sepulchre.</p>
</blockquote><figcaption>— John 20:1</figcaption></figure>

<figure><blockquote>
<p>Now when Jesus was risen early the <em>first day of the week, he appeared first to Mary Magdalene</em>, out of whom he had cast seven devils.</p>
</blockquote><figcaption>— Mark 16:9</figcaption></figure>

<p>Jesus’ followers were so concerned about the Sabbath that they even stopped their labor of love in preparing His body for burial, kept the Sabbath, and returned to resume their unfinished work early Sunday morning. Notice there is no mention of them keeping the first day, Sunday, holy in honor of Jesus’ resurrection, nor is there a command by Jesus to do so. When He appeared to Mary Magdalene that morning there was no talk of Sunday keeping at all.</p>
<h2 id="what-was-instituted-in-honor-of-jesus-resurrection">What was instituted in honor of Jesus’ resurrection?<a href="#what-was-instituted-in-honor-of-jesus-resurrection" class="anchor-link" aria-label="Copy link">

<figure><blockquote>
<p>Know ye not, that so many of us as were baptized into Jesus Christ were baptized into his death? Therefore <em>we are buried with him by baptism into death: that like as Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the Father, even so we also should walk in newness of life</em>. For if we have been planted together in the likeness of his death, we shall be also in the likeness of his resurrection: knowing this, <em>that our old man is crucified with him, that the body of sin might be destroyed, that henceforth we should not serve sin</em>.</p>
</blockquote><figcaption>— Romans 6:3-5</figcaption></figure>

<p>Jesus instituted baptism in honor of His resurrection, which serves as a symbol of death to sin and the start of a new life in and for Christ.</p>
<h2 id="didnt-the-disciples-break-bread-on-the-first-day">Didn’t the disciples break bread on the first day?<a href="#didnt-the-disciples-break-bread-on-the-first-day" class="anchor-link" aria-label="Copy link">

<figure><blockquote>
<p>And upon the <em>first day of the week, when the disciples came together to break bread</em>, Paul preached unto them, ready to depart on the morrow; and continued his speech until midnight.</p>
</blockquote><figcaption>— Acts 20:7</figcaption></figure>

<figure><blockquote>
<p>And they, <em>continuing daily with one accord in the temple, and breaking bread from house to house</em>, did eat their meat with gladness and singleness of heart.</p>
</blockquote><figcaption>— Acts 2:46</figcaption></figure>

<p>The meeting where bread was broken on the first day of the week occured because Paul was leaving the next day; apart from that, the meeting had no special significance because the early Christians broke bread daily. Nothing in these passages indicates that they considered the first day holy.</p>

<figure><blockquote>
<p>Then the same day at evening, <em>being the first day of the week</em>, when the doors were shut where the disciples were assembled for fear of the Jews, <em>came Jesus and stood in the midst</em>, and saith unto them, Peace be unto you. And when he had so said, he shewed unto them his hands and his side. Then were the disciples glad, when they saw the Lord. Then said Jesus to them again, Peace be unto you: as my Father hath sent me, even so send I you.</p>
</blockquote><figcaption>— John 20:19-21</figcaption></figure>

<p>Here Jesus appears to His disciples in person, but once again, He makes no mention of the need to gather together on Sunday in honor of His resurrection.</p>
<h2 id="how-about-1-corinthians-162">How about 1 Corinthians 16:2?<a href="#how-about-1-corinthians-162" class="anchor-link" aria-label="Copy link">

<p>Now concerning the collection for the saints, as I have given order to the churches of Galatia, even so do ye. Upon the <em>first day of the week let every one of you lay by him in store</em>, as God hath prospered him, that there be no gatherings when I come. And when I come, whomsoever ye shall approve by your letters, them will I send to bring your liberality unto Jerusalem.</p>
</blockquote><figcaption>— 1 Corinthians 16:1-3</figcaption></figure>

<p>Here Paul is asking each person to put money aside for the needy, privately, once the Sabbath is over, so it would be ready when he comes. There is no mention of Sunday as a holy day.</p>

</blockquote><figcaption>— Matthew 5:17, 18</figcaption></figure>

<p>There are no verses in the Bible of Jesus changing the fourth commandment to mean observing Sunday instead of Saturday, nor did He tell others to do so later on. On the contrary, His mission was to fulfill the law, to uphold and expand it beyond the “letter” of the law to include the “spirit” of the law, as well. (For example, He expanded the sin of adultery to also include lust of the heart in <a href="https://bible-api.com/Matthew%205%3A28?translation=kjv" class="verse-link" data-reference="Matthew 5:28" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Matthew 5:28</a>.)</p>

<figure><blockquote>
<p>Love worketh no ill to his neighbour: therefore <em>love is the fulfilling of the law</em>.</p>

<p>It was a heart filled with love for His Father that enabled Jesus to fulfill the law in His life.</p>

<figure><blockquote>
<p>That the righteousness of the law <em>might be fulfilled in us</em>, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit.</p>

<figure><blockquote>
<p><em>Ask, and it shall be given you</em>; seek, and ye shall find; knock, and it shall be opened unto you: <em>For every one that asketh receiveth</em>; and he that seeketh findeth; and to him that knocketh it shall be opened.</p>
</blockquote><figcaption>— Matthew 7:7, 8</figcaption></figure>

<p>If my heart is actuated by love for Jesus and filled with the Holy Spirit then the law can be fulfilled in my life too. I just have to ask Him and have faith that He can and will do it.</p>
