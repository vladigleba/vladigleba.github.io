</blockquote><figcaption>— Daniel 7:23</figcaption></figure><p>Beasts in Bible prophecy represent earthly kingdoms, and they are a fitting symbol because throughout history, these kingdoms have been distinguished by cruelty, force, and oppression. In contrast, Revelation portrays king Jesus as a Lamb (<a href="https://bible-api.com/Revelation%205%3A13?translation=kjv" class="verse-link" data-reference="Revelation 5:13" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Revelation 5:13</a>; <a href="https://bible-api.com/Revelation%2012%3A11?translation=kjv" class="verse-link" data-reference="Revelation 12:11" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">12:11</a>; <a href="https://bible-api.com/Revelation%2017%3A14?translation=kjv" class="verse-link" data-reference="Revelation 17:14" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">17:14</a>) because He is guided by love and gentleness. Instead of imposing His will by force, He stands at the door of the heart and knocks (<a href="https://bible-api.com/Revelation%203%3A20?translation=kjv" class="verse-link" data-reference="Revelation 3:20" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Revelation 3:20</a>), waiting to be let inside.</p></section>

</blockquote><figcaption>— Daniel 7:4</figcaption></figure><figure><blockquote>
<p>The <em>king of Babylon</em> hath heard the report of them, and his hands waxed feeble: anguish took hold of him, and pangs as of a woman in travail. Behold, <em>he shall come up like a lion</em> from the swelling of Jordan unto the habitation of the strong: but I will make them suddenly run away from her: and who is a chosen man, that I may appoint over her? for who is like me? and who will appoint me the time? and who is that shepherd that will stand before me?</p>
</blockquote><figcaption>— Jeremiah 50:43-44</figcaption></figure><p>The first beast coming up out of the sea was like a lion, which represented the kingdom of Babylon. In <a href="/prophecy/europe/">Daniel 2</a>, the first kingdom represented by the head of gold was also Babylon. The Bible operates on the principle of repetition where previously covered subjects are repeated and new details added, and so Daniel 7 covers the same kingdoms as Daniel 2, but adds more details to each.</p></section>

</blockquote><figcaption>— Daniel 7:5</figcaption></figure><p>Babylon was eventually conquered by Medo-Persia, which is symbolized by a bear raised up on one side because this second empire was made up of two groups of people—the Medes, who came up first, and the Persians, who eventually became stronger. The three ribs in the mouth of the bear represent the three main powers conquered by Medo-Persia: Lydia, Babylon, and Egypt.

<li>It would emerge from the fourth kingdom—the pagan Roman Empire (<a href="https://bible-api.com/Daniel%207%3A7-8?translation=kjv" class="verse-link" data-reference="Daniel 7:7-8" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Daniel 7:7-8</a>),</li>

        </svg></a></h2><p>Historians would be able to quickly identify the power being described because there is only one that fits them all—the papacy. Now it is important to emphasize that this is not a condemnation of Roman Catholics; rather, the Bible is pointing out a system—Catholicism. In other places the Bible also points out the faults of the Jewish and Protestant faiths. Moreover, God has devoted Christians in all churches, including the Roman Catholic church. It is also true that the papacy has done many good deeds for the poor and the needy, but she has also committed serious errors that the Bible clearly points out in Daniel and in Revelation. God must sometimes chasten and rebuke because He wants us to be aware of error and compromise, and people who are truly loyal to Him will heed His warnings, no matter the faith. With this in mind, let’s examine each of the nine characteristics:</p><ol>
<li>
<p><em>It came up among the 10 kingdoms of Western Europe.</em> The papal power is in the heart of Western Europe in Rome, Italy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>It would have a man at its head speaking for it.</em> The papacy has the pope at its head who speaks for it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>It would uproot three kingdoms.</em> Most of the 10 kingdoms of Western Europe supported the papacy, but three of them did not: the Heruli, the Ostrogoths, and the Vandals. These had to be destroyed before the papacy could rise to power. The Heruli were eradicated in 493, the Vandals in 534, and the power of the Ostrogoths was curtailed in 538.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>It would emerge from the fourth kingdom—the pagan Roman Empire.</em> The papacy is a continuation of the pagan Roman Empire, and historians attest to this. “The mighty Catholic Church was little more than the Roman Empire baptized. … The very capital of the old Roman Empire became the capital of the Christian empire. The office of Pontifex Maximus was continued in that of the pope.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">[1]</a></sup> “Whatever Roman elements the barbarians and Arians left … [came] under the protection of the Bishop of Rome, who was the chief person there after the emperor’s disappearance. … The Roman church … pushed itself into the place of the Roman World-Empire, of which it is the actual continuation.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn2" id="fnref2">[2]</a></sup></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>It would make war with the saints.</em> It is no secret that the Roman Catholic church killed millions of people whose religious convictions differed from hers, especially during the Dark Ages. “That the Church of Rome has shed more innocent blood than any other institution that has ever existed among mankind, will be questioned by no Protestant who has a competent knowledge of history.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn3" id="fnref3">[3]</a></sup></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>It would be different from the 10 other kingdoms.</em> The papacy is different from the other secular powers in Europe in that it rose to power as a religious power.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>It would persecute the saints for “a time and times and the dividing of time.”</em> In the Bible a time is a year, times is two years, and half a time is half of a year, so this is a total of three and a half years. The Amplified Bible actually translates it as “three and one-half years.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn4" id="fnref4">[4]</a></sup> This same period is also mentioned as 42 months in <a href="https://bible-api.com/Revelation%2011%3A2?translation=kjv" class="verse-link" data-reference="Revelation 11:2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Revelation 11:2</a>; <a href="https://bible-api.com/Revelation%2013%3A5?translation=kjv" class="verse-link" data-reference="Revelation 13:5" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">13:5</a>, as well as 1,260 days in <a href="https://bible-api.com/Revelation%2011%3A3?translation=kjv" class="verse-link" data-reference="Revelation 11:3" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Revelation 11:3</a>; <a href="https://bible-api.com/Revelation%2012%3A6%2C%2014?translation=kjv" class="verse-link" data-reference="Revelation 12:6, 14" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">12:6, 14</a> (the Jewish calendar is 30 days). In the Bible one prophetic day equals one literal year (<a href="https://bible-api.com/Ezekiel%204%3A6?translation=kjv" class="verse-link" data-reference="Ezekiel 4:6" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ezekiel 4:6</a>; <a href="https://bible-api.com/Numbers%2014%3A34?translation=kjv" class="verse-link" data-reference="Numbers 14:34" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Numbers 14:34</a>), so the little horn would have power to persecute the saints for 1,260 years. The papacy gained this power in 538 when the Ostrogoths, the last of the opposing kingdoms, were uprooted, and it ruled until 1798 when Napoleon’s general, Berthier, took the pope captive. Thus, its 1,260 year rule from 538 to 1798 is a direct fulfillment of this prophecy. <a href="https://bible-api.com/Matthew%2024%3A21-22?translation=kjv" class="verse-link" data-reference="Matthew 24:21-22" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Matthew 24:21-22</a> mentions this period of persecution against the saints, saying no soul would have survived it if God did not shorten it, but He did shorten it, and the persecution ended well before 1798.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>It would “speak great words against” (blaspheme) God.</em> <a href="https://bible-api.com/Daniel%207%3A25?translation=kjv" class="verse-link" data-reference="Daniel 7:25" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Daniel 7:25</a> (“speak great words against the most High”) is echoed by <a href="https://bible-api.com/Revelation%2013%3A5?translation=kjv" class="verse-link" data-reference="Revelation 13:5" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Revelation 13:5</a> (“speaking great things and blasphemies”), so speaking great words is equivalent to blasphemy, which has two definitions in the Bible: claiming to forgive sins (<a href="https://bible-api.com/Luke%205%3A21?translation=kjv" class="verse-link" data-reference="Luke 5:21" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Luke 5:21</a>), and claiming to be God (<a href="https://bible-api.com/John%2010%3A33?translation=kjv" class="verse-link" data-reference="John 10:33" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">John 10:33</a>). The papacy claims both of these things. “Does the Priest truly forgive the sins, or does he only declare that they are remitted? The Priest does really and truly forgive the sins in virtue of the power given to him by Christ.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn5" id="fnref5">[5]</a></sup> “We [the popes] hold upon this earth the place of God Almighty.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn6" id="fnref6">[6]</a></sup> “The pope is not only the representative of Jesus Christ, but he is Jesus Christ, Himself, hidden under the veil of flesh.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn7" id="fnref7">[7]</a></sup></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>It would attempt “to change times and laws.”</em> This is a reference to the law of God, and there is only one commandment that is both a time and a law: the fourth commandment about keeping the seventh day Sabbath holy. Furthermore, there is also only one Lawgiver (<a href="https://bible-api.com/James%204%3A12?translation=kjv" class="verse-link" data-reference="James 4:12" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">James 4:12</a>), the Creator of heaven and earth, and no one can actually change the law of God (<a href="https://bible-api.com/Luke%2016%3A17?translation=kjv" class="verse-link" data-reference="Luke 16:17" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Luke 16:17</a>), but the papacy has thought to transfer the Sabbath from Saturday to Sunday, the first day of the week. In its catechisms, it has also removed the second commandment against the veneration of images, shortened the fourth commandment, and divided the tenth commandment into two. In other words, there are now two apparent lawgivers, with two different days of worship, but only one of them is legitimate—the seventh-day Sabbath of the Almighty God.</p>
</li>
</ol><p>There is no other organization but the papacy that fits all nine of the characteristics of the little horn power of Daniel 7. And this is not a new idea either because every Protestant reformer believed the papacy was the antichrist.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn8" id="fnref8">[8]</a></sup></p></section>

<p>Little children, it is the last time: and as ye have heard that <em>antichrist shall come, even now are there many antichrists</em>; whereby we know that it is the last time. They went out from us, but they were not of us; for if they had been of us, they would no doubt have continued with us: but they went out, that they might be made manifest that they were not all of us. But ye have an unction from the Holy One, and ye know all things. I have not written unto you because ye know not the truth, but because ye know it, and that no lie is of the truth. Who is a liar but he that denieth that Jesus is the Christ? He is antichrist, that denieth the Father and the Son.</p>
</blockquote><figcaption>— 1 John 2:18-22</figcaption></figure><p>It’s true that through out history many antichrists have worked against God, but there is only one entity, the papacy, that fulfills the traits of the little horn power, which makes the following claim, “we declare, we proclaim, we define that it is absolutely necessary for salvation that every human creature be subject to the Roman Pontiff,”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn9" id="fnref9">[9]</a></sup> despite the fact that salvation is a gift, by grace through faith (<a href="https://bible-api.com/Ephesians%202%3A8-9?translation=kjv" class="verse-link" data-reference="Ephesians 2:8-9" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ephesians 2:8-9</a>). Some may expect the antichrist to openly oppose God, but the word “antichrist” has two meanings: opposition to Christ or acting in place of Christ. Ultimately, both actions seek to supplant God’s position and authority, which is a continuation of Satan’s original aim in heaven.</p><p>Satan’s work of deception in the last days is much more effective when the antichrist appears spiritual and holy, but God, in His love, gave the prophecies of Daniel and Revelation to expose these deceptions so that people are not mislead. Many will follow antichrist (<a href="https://bible-api.com/Revelation%2013%3A3?translation=kjv" class="verse-link" data-reference="Revelation 13:3" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Revelation 13:3</a>) thinking they are following Jesus, but those who test every teaching by the Bible (<a href="https://bible-api.com/Isaiah%208%3A20?translation=kjv" class="verse-link" data-reference="Isaiah 8:20" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Isaiah 8:20</a>) will follow the Lamb (<a href="https://bible-api.com/Revelation%2014%3A4?translation=kjv" class="verse-link" data-reference="Revelation 14:4" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Revelation 14:4</a>).</p></section>
