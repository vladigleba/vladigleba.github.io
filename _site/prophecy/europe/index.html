<p>And in the second year of the reign of Nebuchadnezzar Nebuchadnezzar <em>dreamed dreams</em>, wherewith his spirit was troubled, and his sleep brake from him. Then the <em>king commanded to call the magicians, and the astrologers, and the sorcerers, and the Chaldeans, for to shew the king his dreams</em>. So they came and stood before the king. And the king said unto them, I have dreamed a dream, and my spirit was troubled to know the dream. Then spake the Chaldeans to the king in Syriack, O king, live for ever: tell thy servants the dream, and we will shew the interpretation.</p>
<p>The king answered and said to the Chaldeans, The thing is gone from me: if ye will not make known unto me the dream, with the interpretation thereof, ye shall be cut in pieces, and your houses shall be made a dunghill. But if ye shew the dream, and the interpretation thereof, ye shall receive of me gifts and rewards and great honour: therefore shew me the dream, and the interpretation thereof. They answered again and said, Let the king tell his servants the dream, and we will shew the interpretation of it.</p>
<p>The king answered and said, I know of certainty that ye would gain the time, because ye see the thing is gone from me. But if ye will not make known unto me the dream, there is but one decree for you: for ye have prepared lying and corrupt words to speak before me, till the time be changed: therefore tell me the dream, and I shall know that ye can shew me the interpretation thereof.</p>
<p>The Chaldeans answered before the king, and said, There is not a man upon the earth that can shew the king’s matter: therefore there is no king, lord, nor ruler, that asked such things at any magician, or astrologer, or Chaldean. And <em>it is a rare thing that the king requireth, and there is none other that can shew it before the king, except the gods</em>, whose dwelling is not with flesh.</p>
<p>For this cause <em>the king was angry and very furious, and commanded to destroy all the wise men of Babylon</em>.</p>

<p>Daniel asked his friends to join him in prayer, seeking God to reveal the dream, and their request was granted when God revealed it to Daniel. This underscores the important role that prayer plays in the life of a Christian (see <a href="/basics/prayer/">“Keys to Effective Prayer”</a>).</p>

<p>Aptly symbolized by a head of gold, Babylon was one of the most extravagant kingdoms of antiquity. It ruled supreme from 612 BC onward, after conquering the Assyrian capital of Nineveh.

<p>In one of the most astoundingly detailed prophecies, God not only explicitly named Cyrus through His prophet Isaiah but also predicted the manner in which he would conquer Babylon—more than 150 years before it happened! According to the ancient historian Herodotus, when Cyrus surrounded Babylon, his armies diverted the Euphrates River that flowed through the city, allowing them to pass under the city’s walls by walking on the riverbed. Babylon also had street gates that controlled access to the river, but that night, the gates were left open!</p>

<figure><blockquote>
<p>O house of Israel, cannot I do with you as this potter? saith the LORD. Behold, as the <em>clay is in the potter’s hand, so are ye in mine hand, O house of Israel</em>.</p>
</blockquote><figcaption>— Jeremiah 18:6</figcaption></figure>

<p>Unlike the head, chest, thighs, and legs—each made of a single metal—the feet and toes are composed of a mixture of iron and clay. This indicates that the kingdom they represent will be fundamentally different from the ones before it. The iron is described as strong, while the clay—the only non-metal element in the statue—is called “broken” (fragile). <a href="https://bible-api.com/Jeremiah%2018%3A6?translation=kjv" class="verse-link" data-reference="Jeremiah 18:6" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Jeremiah 18:6</a> tells us that clay represents God’s people—His church—because of its apparent fragility, especially when contrasted with the strength of civil power, which holds the authority to enforce law and order.</p>
<p>When the Christian church started apostatizing, it sought to regain the power of the apostolic church by uniting with civil government to enforce its laws against heretics. The Edict of Milan in 313 AD opened the door for the union of church and state that, in God's eyes, cannot be legitimately joined (<a href="https://bible-api.com/Daniel%202%3A43?translation=kjv" class="verse-link" data-reference="Daniel 2:43" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Daniel 2:43</a>). Because this union is illegitimate, it will disintegrate at Christ’s second coming, symbolized by the stone cut without hands that crushes the image to powder (<a href="https://bible-api.com/Daniel%202%3A34?translation=kjv" class="verse-link" data-reference="Daniel 2:34" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Daniel 2:34</a>). The only legitimate union of God’s church is with Jesus Christ, who is described as her Husband (<a href="https://bible-api.com/Ephesians%205%3A25?translation=kjv" class="verse-link" data-reference="Ephesians 5:25" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ephesians 5:25</a>) and the Rock upon which she is built (<a href="https://bible-api.com/Ephesians%202%3A19-22?translation=kjv" class="verse-link" data-reference="Ephesians 2:19-22" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ephesians 2:19-22</a>; <a href="https://bible-api.com/Matthew%207%3A24-25?translation=kjv" class="verse-link" data-reference="Matthew 7:24-25" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Matthew 7:24-25</a>). With such a sure Foundation, she has no need for protection or support from civil power to ensure her survival.</p>

<p>The iron-clay mixture in the feet forms the base upon which the entire image stands. This suggests that the blending of religion and government is, unfortunately, a fundamental feature throughout history, and that the union of apostate Christianity with civil power, specifically, is the culmination—the climax—toward which history has been trending.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">[1]</a></sup> Under the Babylonian, Medo-Persian, Grecian, and Roman empires, religion was deeply intertwined with the state, so much so that it became a civic duty rather than merely a personal matter. What is especially notable about the iron-clay mixture in the feet is that it represents a power professing to be God’s church—one that ought to know better, especially since Jesus Himself said that His kingdom is not of this world (<a href="https://bible-api.com/John%2018%3A36?translation=kjv" class="verse-link" data-reference="John 18:36" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">John 18:36</a>).</p>
<p>In the pagan empires mentioned above, the state was supreme over religion, using religion to support its authority. However, under the papal government symbolized by the feet, this pattern was reversed: religion was elevated above the state, using the state for its support. Thus, the mingling of religion and government in the pagan empires served as a precursor to the ultimate form of this union under the papacy.</p>
<p>Although Constantine began blending church and state in 313 AD with the Edict of Milan,<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn2" id="fnref2">[2]</a></sup> the church did not gain total supremacy over the state until 538 AD, when the last barbarian tribe opposing the papacy—the Ostrogoths—was overthrown. With this achieved, Justinian’s decree of 533 AD, which elevated the pope to headship over all churches and appointed him the corrector of all heresies, could be fully enforced.</p>
<p>It is remarkable that, instead of clean break between the metals, the iron found in the legs continues into the feet and toes, extending all the way to the end of time. When the Roman Empire crumbled, a new power rose in its place, led by the pope, who claimed the title <em>Pontifex Maximus</em> adopted by the Caesars. Consequently, the Roman element, symbolized by iron, shifted from the civil authority of the Roman Empire to that of the <em>Roman</em> Catholic Church, which claimed this right, in part, based on the forged <em>Donation of Constantine</em>. Pagan Rome had become papal Rome.</p>
<p>Under this new arrangement, the pope not only assumed the imperial title of the Caesars but also claimed the religious title <em>Vicar of Christ</em>, asserting himself as the successor of Peter and the head of all churches. Thus, the Roman Catholic Church is a union of church and state, symbolized by the iron and clay, with the state subservient to the church—a complete reversal of the pattern seen in the previous empires.</p>

<p>And the <em>ten horns</em> out of this kingdom are <em>ten kings</em> that shall arise: and another shall rise after them; and he shall be diverse from the first, and he shall subdue three kings.</p>
</blockquote><figcaption>— Daniel 7:24</figcaption></figure>

<p>The prophecy of Daniel 2 is expanded in Daniel 7: just as the image in Daniel 2 has ten toes, so the fourth beast in Daniel 7 has ten horns. Eighteen distinct tribes played a role in the destruction of the Western Roman Empire,<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn3" id="fnref3">[3]</a></sup> but exaclty ten--no more, no less--remained when the Empire finally collapsed in AD 476, just as the Bible had predicted by the ten toes of Daniel 2 and the ten horns of Daniel 7. Three of the ten were destroyed (see <a href="/prophecy/antichrist/#what-power-fits-these-characteristics">"Who Is the Antichrist?"</a>), but the seven remaining would give rise to the modern nations of Europe: Visigoths (Spain), Franks (France), Alemanni (Germany), Suevi (Portugal), Anglo-Saxons (England), Burgundians (Switzerland), Lombards (Italy), Heruli (destroyed in 493 AD), Vandals (destroyed in 534 AD), and Ostrogoths (destroyed in 538 AD).</p>

<p>Since the toes are the final portion of the image, the national divisions they symbolize will remain until the Second Coming of Christ, despite numerous attempts throughout history to reunite them. Leaders such as Charlemagne, Napoleon, Kaiser Wilhelm II, and Hitler all tried and failed to restore a fully unified empire. Even modern efforts, like the European Union, will not succeed. No power will ever rise again to unite all nations under a single empire, as Babylon, Medo-Persia, Greece, and Rome once did.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn4" id="fnref4">[4]</a></sup></p>

<figure><blockquote>
<p>And in the days of these kings shall the God of heaven set up <em>a kingdom, which shall never be destroyed</em>: and the kingdom shall not be left to other people, but it shall break in pieces and consume all these kingdoms, and <em>it shall stand for ever</em>. Forasmuch as thou sawest that the stone was cut out of the mountain without hands, and that it brake in pieces the iron, the brass, the clay, the silver, and the gold; the great God hath made known to the king what shall come to pass hereafter: and the dream is certain, and the interpretation thereof sure.</p>
</blockquote><figcaption>— Daniel 2:44-45</figcaption></figure>

<p>The stone cut without hands represents the kingdom of heaven, which will replace all earthly kingdoms at Christ’s return and establish His eternal reign. Since the stone strikes the image at its feet, this indicates that Jesus will return during the time of the divided nations.</p>

<li id="fn1" class="footnote-item"><p>The United States was the first nation to break this trend because of its Constitution; however, even this would prove to be only temporary, as prophecy predicts a future union of church and state in the United States prior to the Second Coming of Christ (see <a href="/prophecy/usa/">“USA in Bible Prophecy”</a>). This will not be the first occurrence either, as the Supreme Court’s landmark 1892 decision in <em>Church of the Holy Trinity v. United States</em> declared the United States a Christian nation. Moreover, that same year, Congress passed legislation to close the World’s Columbian Exposition in honor of Sunday observance, which was also endorsed by President Benjamin Harrison, who made government funding for the fair conditional on Sunday closure. As a result, only 101 years after the ratification of the First Amendment, which established the separation of church and state, all three branches of the United States government had effectively repudiated that principle. <a href="#fnref1" class="footnote-backref">↩︎</a></p>
