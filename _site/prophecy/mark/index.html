<p>And I stood upon the sand of the sea, and saw a beast <em>rise up out of the sea</em>, having seven heads and ten horns, and upon his horns ten crowns, and <em>upon his heads the name of blasphemy</em>. And the beast which I saw was <em>like unto a leopard, and his feet were as the feet of a bear, and his mouth as the mouth of a lion</em>: and the <em>dragon gave him his power, and his seat, and great authority</em>.</p>
<p>And I saw <em>one of his heads as it were wounded to death</em>; and <em>his deadly wound was healed</em>: and <em>all the world wondered after the beast</em>. And they worshipped the dragon which gave power unto the beast: and they worshipped the beast, saying, Who is like unto the beast? who is able to make war with him? And there was given unto him a <em>mouth speaking great things and blasphemies</em>; and <em>power was given unto him to continue forty and two months</em>. And he <em>opened his mouth in blasphemy against God</em>, to blaspheme his name, and his tabernacle, and them that dwell in heaven.</p>
<p>And it was given unto him to <em>make war with the saints, and to overcome them</em>: and <em>power was given him over all kindreds, and tongues, and nations</em>. And <em>all that dwell upon the earth shall worship him</em>, whose names are not written in the book of life of the Lamb slain from the foundation of the world. If any man have an ear, let him hear. He that leadeth into captivity shall go into captivity: he that killeth with the sword must be killed with the sword. Here is the patience and the faith of the saints.</p>

<li>It becomes a strong political power (<a href="https://bible-api.com/Revelation%2013%3A3%2C%207?translation=kjv" class="verse-link" data-reference="Revelation 13:3, 7" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Revelation 13:3, 7</a>),</li>
<li>It becomes a strong religious power (<a href="https://bible-api.com/Revelation%2013%3A3%2C%208?translation=kjv" class="verse-link" data-reference="Revelation 13:3, 8" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Revelation 13:3, 8</a>),</li>

          <use href="/assets/images/icons.svg#link"></use>
        </svg></a></h2><p>The Bible often operates on the principle of repetition where previously covered subjects are repeated and new details added. If some of these characteristics described in Revelation 13 sound familiar it’s because the beast described here is the <a href="/prophecy/antichrist/">same power</a> as the little horn of Daniel 7, which we previously learned represents the papacy. Now it’s worth repeating that this is not a condemnation of Roman Catholics; rather, the Bible is pointing out a system—Catholicism. In other places the Bible also points out the faults of the Jewish and Protestant faiths. Moreover, God has devoted Christians in all churches, including the Roman Catholic church. It’s also true that the papacy has done many good deeds for the poor and the needy, but she has also committed serious errors that the Bible clearly points out in Daniel and in Revelation. God must sometimes chasten and rebuke because He wants us to be aware of error and compromise, and people who are truly loyal to Him will heed His warnings, no matter the faith. With this in mind, let’s examine each of the 11 characteristics:</p><ol>
<li>
<p><em>It rises out of the sea.</em> We previously learned that waters represent densely populated areas (<a href="https://bible-api.com/Revelation%2017%3A15?translation=kjv" class="verse-link" data-reference="Revelation 17:15" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Revelation 17:15</a>), and since the papacy arose in Rome, Italy—a peninsula in the heart of Western Europe—it fits this point.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>It is the composite of the four beasts of Daniel 7.</em> The beast is the composite of these beasts (<a href="https://bible-api.com/Daniel%207%3A4-7?translation=kjv" class="verse-link" data-reference="Daniel 7:4-7" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Daniel 7:4-7</a>) because it incorporates various beliefs and practices from all four empires, and the papacy fits this point too. “In a certain respect, she [the papacy] has copied her organization from that of the Roman Empire, has preserved and made fruitful the philosophical intuitions of Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle, borrowed from both Barbarians and the Byzantine Roman Empire, but always remains herself, thoroughly digesting all elements drawn from external sources.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">[1]</a></sup></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>The dragon gives it power and authority.</em> The dragon can be identified by reading <a href="https://bible-api.com/Revelation%2012%3A1-6?translation=kjv" class="verse-link" data-reference="Revelation 12:1-6" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Revelation 12:1-6</a> where it talks about a pregnant woman about to deliver and the dragon hoping to devour the baby at birth; however, the child evades the dragon by being caught up to heaven. This is an obvious reference to Jesus, whom Herod tried to kill by slaying all the babies in Bethlehem (<a href="https://bible-api.com/Matthew%202%3A16?translation=kjv" class="verse-link" data-reference="Matthew 2:16" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Matthew 2:16</a>). Herod was acting under his authority as a king of Rome, so the dragon represents pagan Rome, but the real power behind Herod’s plot was the devil (<a href="https://bible-api.com/Revelation%2012%3A7-9?translation=kjv" class="verse-link" data-reference="Revelation 12:7-9" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Revelation 12:7-9</a>) who likes to act through various governments to move his ugly work forward. The Roman Empire eventually fell in 476, and its power and capital city were inherited by the papacy. “The Roman Church … pushed itself into the place of the Roman World-Empire, of which it is the actual continuation. … The Pope … is Caesar’s successor.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn2" id="fnref2">[2]</a></sup> “The mighty Catholic Church was little more than the Roman Empire baptised. Rome was transformed as well as converted. The very capital of the old Empire became the capital of the Christian Empire. The office of Pontifex Maximus was continued in that of Pope.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn3" id="fnref3">[3]</a></sup></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>It receives a deadly wound.</em> This prophecy was fulfilled when Napoleon’s general, Alexander Berthier, took Pope Pius VI captive in 1798. When the pope died in 1799, “half Europe thought … that without the Pope the Papacy was dead.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn4" id="fnref4">[4]</a></sup></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Its deadly wound is healed.</em> The power and influence of the papacy has been increasing steadily over the years, and today she is not only one of the most powerful religious organizations in the world, but she has strong political influence as well. When the wound is completely healed, <a href="https://bible-api.com/Revelation%2013%3A3?translation=kjv" class="verse-link" data-reference="Revelation 13:3" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Revelation 13:3</a> says the entire world will give homage to it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>It becomes a strong political power.</em> <a href="https://bible-api.com/Revelation%2013%3A7?translation=kjv" class="verse-link" data-reference="Revelation 13:7" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Revelation 13:7</a> says the papacy will have political power and influence over all of the nations of the world. The papacy’s political rise started when Italian dictator Benito Mussolini signed a treaty with the Vatican establishing it as a political state and protecting it from interference by the Italian government. Even though Vatican City is the smallest country in the world, it now has ambassadors (called “papal nuncios”) in every part of the globe. In 1984, it established diplomatic relations with the United States, and in 2015 Pope Francis spoke to a joint session of the U.S. Congress for the first time ever. No doubt, the wound has been healing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>It becomes a strong religious power.</em> <a href="https://bible-api.com/Revelation%2013%3A8?translation=kjv" class="verse-link" data-reference="Revelation 13:8" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Revelation 13:8</a> says the papacy will be worshiped, which implies religious power and influence, by the entire world. Today the pope is respected by faiths across the religious spectrum. In 2014 Francis led an ecumenical worship service that was attended by Anglican, Lutheran, Methodist, and Orthodox representatives. He has also hosted a prayer summit at the Vatican with Israeli and Palesinian leaders. Cardinal Timothy Dolan had this to say: “The more he tries to de-emphasize the prestige and the power of the papacy, … the more people pay attention to him.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn5" id="fnref5">[5]</a></sup></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>It speaks blasphemy against God.</em> Blasphemy is defined as claiming to forgive sins (<a href="https://bible-api.com/Luke%205%3A21?translation=kjv" class="verse-link" data-reference="Luke 5:21" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Luke 5:21</a>) and claiming to be God (<a href="https://bible-api.com/John%2010%3A33?translation=kjv" class="verse-link" data-reference="John 10:33" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">John 10:33</a>). The papacy <a href="/prophecy/antichrist/#what-power-fits-these-characteristics">fits these points</a> because her priests claim to forgive sins and the popes claim to be Vicars of Christ.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>It wars against the saints and overcomes them.</em> The papacy persecuted and killed millions of people during the Dark Ages for following their conscience.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>It rules for 42 months.</em> The papacy ruled for <a href="/prophecy/antichrist/#what-power-fits-these-characteristics">42 prophetic months</a>, which equates to 1,260 years, from 538 to 1798. During this time the papacy had power to persecute and kill anyone who followed the Bible over its own traditions, and as a result, many had to flee their native countries or even escape into the wilderness. This was clearly foretold in <a href="https://bible-api.com/Revelation%2012%3A6%2C%2014?translation=kjv" class="verse-link" data-reference="Revelation 12:6, 14" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Revelation 12:6, 14</a> and vividly fulfilled, for example, in the history of the Huguenots who fled France and the Waldensians who escaped into the Cottian Alps because they refused to compromise with the unbiblical teachings of the Roman Catholic Church.</p>
</li>

<p>The earth mourneth and fadeth away, the world languisheth and fadeth away, the haughty people of the earth do languish.

</blockquote><figcaption>— Ezekiel 22:26, 31</figcaption></figure><p>God warns religious leaders who ignore His law and say that some commandments do not matter because such actions cause many people to stumble, but He also warns people who do not desire to learn about the law and want smooth fables to be preached, instead. Why? Because changing or refusing to follow God’s law has real consequences, including tragedy and upheaval on the earth. And this is not because God delights in heartache and misery, but because His law of love is there to protect from it. When it’s continually ignored, He will eventually stop pleading and let the consequences of rebellion play out. God cares about the truth being preached because He does not want anyone to be deceived, and so Ezekiel warns that those who teach there is no difference between sacred things, such as God’s holy day, and common things, such as Sunday, will one day face His indignation.</p></section>

When God told the Israelites to place His law on their foreheads He wanted the law to be in their minds. Likewise, the mark of the beast in the forehead (mind) is a decision to keep Sunday due to a conviction that it’s holy. Regarding being marked on the hand, in the Bible the hand represents work, so it’s accepting Sunday-keeping though one’s actions for practical reasons (convenience, job, family), not because of a conviction that it’s holy. In other words, the mark of the beast is a marking of oneself by accepting the beast’s mark, Sunday, either through conviction or actions, as opposed to God’s seal, the true seventh day Sabbath. Even though it’s not an obvious physical mark, God will know who has His seal and who has the beast’s mark (<a href="https://bible-api.com/2%20Timothy%202%3A19?translation=kjv" class="verse-link" data-reference="2 Timothy 2:19" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2 Timothy 2:19</a>).</p></section>

The conflict between God and Lucifer <a href="/gospel/evil/">started in heaven</a> over the issue of worship because Lucifer wanted to be worshiped like the Creator God, and it’s clear that worship will be central in the last days too. Will I worship the Creator God by observing His Sabbath or the beast by observing his counterfeit Sunday? Some may think it’s just a day, but it was also just a fruit that Adam and Eve ate in the garden of Eden.

Any worship of God that elevates man-made laws above and contrary to the law of God is false worship, and it’s especially dangerous when this is propogated by a religious system. Now this isn’t anything new, or exclusive to Roman Catholicism, because the Jewish leaders of Jesus’ day were guilty of it too.

It may be a difficult decision to make, but the promise from Jesus is that those who follow Him will be blessed with the eternal light of truth that brings fullness of life right now (<a href="https://bible-api.com/John%2010%3A10?translation=kjv" class="verse-link" data-reference="John 10:10" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">John 10:10</a>)! This is why Paul and Silas were able to sing praises to God while in prison for their faith (<a href="https://bible-api.com/Acts%2016%3A23-25?translation=kjv" class="verse-link" data-reference="Acts 16:23-25" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Acts 16:23-25</a>); even though their feet were shackled and their backs lacerated, their souls were filled with the enduring joy that is found only in Jesus!</p><hr class="footnotes-sep"><section class="footnotes">
