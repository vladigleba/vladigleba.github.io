<p><em>I have also spoken by the prophets</em>, and I have multiplied visions, and used similitudes, by the ministry of the prophets.</p>
</blockquote><figcaption>— Hosea 12:10</figcaption></figure><figure><blockquote>
<p>Surely the Lord GOD will do nothing, but he <em>revealeth his secret unto his servants the prophets</em>.</p>
</blockquote><figcaption>— Amos 3:7</figcaption></figure><figure><blockquote>
<p>Remember the former things of old: for I am God, and there is none else; I am God, and there is none like me, <em>declaring the end from the beginning, and from ancient times the things that are not yet done</em>, saying, My counsel shall stand, and I will do all my pleasure.</p>
</blockquote><figcaption>— Isaiah 46:9-10</figcaption></figure><p>God has chosen to use prophets to speak to humanity on His behalf; they share His messages and make His will known. Before significant events unfold, God reveals His intentions to the world through them, so that the human family is warned and prepared.</p><p>For example, He used Noah to warn the world about the flood (<a href="https://bible-api.com/2%20Peter%202%3A5?translation=kjv" class="verse-link" data-reference="2 Peter 2:5" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2 Peter 2:5</a>), while Jeremiah warned Israel about their 70-year captivity in Babylon (<a href="https://bible-api.com/Jeremiah%2025%3A11?translation=kjv" class="verse-link" data-reference="Jeremiah 25:11" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Jeremiah 25:11</a>). Regarding the coming of the Messiah, Isaiah announced that Jesus would would be born of a virgin (<a href="https://bible-api.com/Isaiah%207%3A14?translation=kjv" class="verse-link" data-reference="Isaiah 7:14" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Isaiah 7:14</a>), Micah said He would be born in Bethlehem (<a href="https://bible-api.com/Micah%205%3A2?translation=kjv" class="verse-link" data-reference="Micah 5:2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Micah 5:2</a>), and Daniel prophesied that He would be “cut off” or killed (<a href="https://bible-api.com/Daniel%209%3A26?translation=kjv" class="verse-link" data-reference="Daniel 9:26" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Daniel 9:26</a>). Later, God used John the Baptist to announce that His coming was near (<a href="https://bible-api.com/John%201%3A23-27?translation=kjv" class="verse-link" data-reference="John 1:23-27" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">John 1:23-27</a>). After Jesus’ ascension, Paul announced that Jesus would return a second time (<a href="https://bible-api.com/1%20Thessalonians%204%3A16-17?translation=kjv" class="verse-link" data-reference="1 Thessalonians 4:16-17" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">1 Thessalonians 4:16-17</a>), and given the importance of His return, we can expect the gift of prophecy to be evident again in the last days to warn and prepare the world.</p></section>

<p>And <em>many false prophets shall rise, and shall deceive many</em>. And because iniquity shall abound, the love of many shall wax cold. … For there shall <em>arise false Christs, and false prophets</em>, and shall shew great signs and wonders; insomuch that, if it were possible, they shall deceive the very elect.</p>
</blockquote><figcaption>— Matthew 24:11, 24</figcaption></figure><p>Jesus said there will be many false prophets in the last days deceiving people with signs and wonders. The working of miracles, therefore, is not sufficient evidence of a genuine prophet (<a href="https://bible-api.com/Revelation%2013%3A13-14?translation=kjv" class="verse-link" data-reference="Revelation 13:13-14" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Revelation 13:13-14</a>; <a href="https://bible-api.com/Revelation%2016%3A14?translation=kjv" class="verse-link" data-reference="Revelation 16:14" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">16:14</a>). But it’s important to note that Jesus did not say that all prophets will be false ones. Since He warned about false ones, there must be genuine ones too.</p></section>

For all who do these things are an abomination to the Lord, and because of these abominations the Lord your God drives them out from before you</p>
</blockquote><figcaption>— Deuteronomy 18:10-12, NKJV</figcaption></figure><p>The Bible specifically names the following types of false prophets:</p><ul>
<li>One who practices witchcraft (fortune teller)</li>
<li>Soothsayer (astrologer)</li>
<li>One who interprets omens (uses charms)</li>
<li>Sorcerer (claims to contact the spirits of the dead)</li>
<li>One who conjures spells</li>
<li>Medium (claims to channel the spirits of the dead)</li>
<li>Spiritist (claims to talk to the dead)</li>
<li>Witch (mentioned in KJV, a psychic)</li>
</ul><p>The Bible clearly teaches that the dead <a href="/basics/death/">cannot be contacted</a>, and any supposed communication with the dead is an abomination to God because such communication is actually with evil spirits masquerading as the dead).</p></section>

<p>Wherefore he saith, When he ascended up on high, he led captivity captive, and <em>gave gifts unto men</em>. … And he gave some, apostles; and <em>some, prophets</em>; and some, evangelists; and some, pastors and teachers; <em>for the perfecting of the saints, for the work of the ministry, for the edifying of the body of Christ: till we all come in the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of God, unto a perfect man, unto the measure of the stature of the fulness of Christ</em>: that we henceforth be no more children, tossed to and fro, and carried about with every wind of doctrine, by the sleight of men, and cunning craftiness, whereby they lie in wait to deceive; but speaking the truth in love, may grow up into him in all things, which is the head, even Christ.</p>
</blockquote><figcaption>— Ephesians 4:8, 11-15</figcaption></figure><figure><blockquote>
<p>Now ye are the body of Christ, and members in particular. And <em>God hath set some in the church</em>, first apostles, <em>secondarily prophets</em>, thirdly teachers, after that miracles, then gifts of healings, helps, governments, diversities of tongues.</p>
</blockquote><figcaption>— 1 Corinthians 12:27-28</figcaption></figure><p>While a prophet can at times edify the public, Paul tells us that prophecy is one of Jesus’ gifts to His church intended to edify its members in their Christian walk as well as to equip them in the work of ministry to others. These gifts are vital to His church and will remain with her until Jesus returns. But it’s also important to emphasize that while the gift of prophecy is a tremendous blessing, it’s not meant to add to, replace, or minimize the Word of God (<a href="https://bible-api.com/Revelation%2022%3A18-19?translation=kjv" class="verse-link" data-reference="Revelation 22:18-19" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Revelation 22:18-19</a>; <a href="https://bible-api.com/Proverbs%2030%3A5-6?translation=kjv" class="verse-link" data-reference="Proverbs 30:5-6" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Proverbs 30:5-6</a>). It’s true that God has used prophets to clarify His Word, but He never used them to originate new beliefs that cannot be supported by the Bible. The genuine gift of prophecy always elevates, and is in harmony with, God’s Word (<a href="https://bible-api.com/Matthew%204%3A4?translation=kjv" class="verse-link" data-reference="Matthew 4:4" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Matthew 4:4</a>).</p></section>

<p>Her gates are sunk into the ground; he hath destroyed and broken her bars: her king and her princes are among the Gentiles: <em>the law is no more; her prophets also find no vision from the LORD</em>.</p>
</blockquote><figcaption>— Lamentations 2:9</figcaption></figure><p>When God’s people knowingly rebel against His holy law, He withdraws the prophetic gift because the gifts of the Spirit are for those who genuinely desire to live a life of complete surrender to Him—a life that’s in harmony with and in obedience to His teachings, summarized in His law (<a href="https://bible-api.com/Matthew%2022%3A36-40?translation=kjv" class="verse-link" data-reference="Matthew 22:36-40" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Matthew 22:36-40</a>). This principle explains why God sent a prophet once His remnant church emerged in the 1800s that kept, and still keeps, all of His commandments, including the <a href="/basics/sabbath/">seventh-day Sabbath</a> observed by Jesus. God also knows exactly when His people are in need of warning, counsel, and guidance, and when that time comes, He lovingly sends them a prophet to strengthen them (<a href="https://bible-api.com/Proverbs%2029%3A18?translation=kjv" class="verse-link" data-reference="Proverbs 29:18" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Proverbs 29:18</a>).</p></section>

</blockquote><figcaption>— 2 Peter 1:20-21</figcaption></figure><p>Jesus gives the gift of prophecy through the Holy Spirit, who distributes it to His people as He wills. In his second epistle, Peter tells us that it’s the Spirit who enables and empowers God’s prophets to speak on His behalf.</p></section>

And also upon the servants and upon the handmaids in those days will I pour out my spirit.</p>
</blockquote><figcaption>— Joel 2:28-29</figcaption></figure><p>This prophecy was partially fulfilled when the Holy Spirit was poured out during Pentecost (<a href="https://bible-api.com/Acts%202%3A1-4?translation=kjv" class="verse-link" data-reference="Acts 2:1-4" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Acts 2:1-4</a>), empowering Jesus’ disciples to take the good news of His great sacrifice for sinners to the entire world. The prophecy will be fully fulfilled in the last days when the Holy Spirit empowers Christ’s followers to warn and prepare the world for His glorious return.</p></section>

<p>And the dragon was wroth with the woman, and went to make war with the remnant of her seed, <em>which keep the commandments of God, and have the testimony of Jesus Christ</em>.</p>
</blockquote><figcaption>— Revelation 12:17</figcaption></figure><figure><blockquote>
<p>And I fell at his feet to worship him. And he said unto me, See thou do it not: I am thy fellowservant, and of thy brethren that have the testimony of Jesus: worship God: for <em>the testimony of Jesus is the spirit of prophecy</em>.</p>
</blockquote><figcaption>— Revelation 19:10</figcaption></figure><p>The <a href="/prophecy/remnant/">remnant</a> of Revelation 12 is God’s church in the last days, and it has two characteristics: keeps God’s commandments and has the testimony of Jesus Christ, which, according to Revelation 19, is the spirit of prophecy. This is another clue that the gift of prophecy will be evident in the last days prior to Jesus’ return; in fact, it’s one of the identifying marks of the remnant church. Paul confirms this in <a href="https://bible-api.com/1%20Corinthians%201%3A4-7?translation=kjv" class="verse-link" data-reference="1 Corinthians 1:4-7" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">1 Corinthians 1:4-7</a> where he says that the church waiting for His return will not lack any of the gifts of the Spirit. Just as God sent John the Baptist to prepare the world for Jesus’ first coming, He will send the gift of prophecy to His last-day commandment-keeping church to prepare the world (and itself) for Jesus’ second coming.</p><p>Incidentally, since the testimony of Jesus is the spirit of prophecy then the words of His prophets are special messages from Jesus to us. Bringing reproach upon His prophets is the same as bringing reproach upon Jesus because He is the One who sends them.</p></section>

</blockquote><figcaption>— 1 Thessalonians 5:19-22</figcaption></figure><p>God has urged His people not to despise the gift of prophecy; in fact, He has pronounced a blessing on those who believe the words of His prophets. In an echo of Jesus’ warning about false prophets, Paul also tells us to test all things so that we can accurately discern whether a prophet is genuine or false.</p></section>

        </svg></a></h2><p>In question eight we learned that the gift of prophecy will be evident in God’s remnant church, which emerged in the 1800s. In order to encourage the growing church, God called a young woman named Ellen Harmon, who later married and became Ellen White, and blessed her with the gift of prophecy, using her to instruct the church as it grew into a worldwide missionary movement. Her life, visions, and writings fulfilled every biblical test of a genuine prophet, and they are evidence that God is doing everything He can to ensure His people have all the encouragement they need in order to thrive in the closing moments of Earth’s history.</p><p>Even though Ellen had little formal education, she went on to write dozens of books on a variety of subjects, including the Bible, health, education, parenting, Christian living, evangelism, and more. Her writing is so impactful that she has become the fourth most translated author of all time. Her book on having a saving relationship with Jesus, <em><a href="https://m.egwwritings.org/en/book/108/toc" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Steps to Christ</a></em>, has been translated into more than 165 languages.</p><p>The best way to get acquainted with her prophetic gift is to read her material for yourself, and it will become evident that her primary goal was to direct people to Jesus as their personal Savior and to the Bible as their only rule of faith and life. Some of her other popular works include a book about the conflict between good and evil called <em><a href="https://m.egwwritings.org/en/book/132/toc" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Great Controversy</a></em>, one about Christ’s famous sermon called <em><a href="https://m.egwwritings.org/en/book/150/toc" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Thoughts From the Mount of Blessing</a></em>, a book about His parables called <em><a href="https://m.egwwritings.org/en/book/15/toc" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Christ’s Object Lessons</a></em>, and a masterpiece about His life called <em><a href="https://m.egwwritings.org/en/book/130/toc" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Desire of Ages</a></em>. Her writings are saturated with references to the Bible, which is elevated at every opportunity and never contradicted. Many who have read her works have been greatly blessed, realizing that she was used by God to communicate His love and truth, thereby leading many into a closer relationship with Him. It could be you if you give her a try.</p></section>
