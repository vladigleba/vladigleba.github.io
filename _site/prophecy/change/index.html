</blockquote><figcaption>— Daniel 7:25</figcaption></figure><p>This is an echo of Paul’s warning about men arising “speaking perverse things.” Again, here’s <a href="/prophecy/antichrist/">a power</a> that would challenge God’s authority, persecute His followers, and change times and laws. There is only one commandment that is both a time and a law: the fourth one.</p><p>The first seeds for its change were planted during Constantine’s conversion to Christianity in 312 A.D. when he passed a law declaring Sunday, which was the pagan day of sun worship, as the day of rest across the Roman Empire. That seed took root in 363 A.D. when the Council of Laodicea urged Christians to keep Sunday as their rest day, while prohibiting them from resting on Saturday, the seventh day Sabbath. Thus, the fourth commandment of God was changed—from honoring the seventh-day Sabbath established at creation to <a href="/prophecy/mark/">honoring Sunday</a>—and the rest is history.</p></section>

</blockquote><figcaption>— Revelation 14:7, 12</figcaption></figure><p>There will be a call in the last days to worship God, the Creator of the universe, which implies there will be another power vying to be worshiped as well. This call is a reference to the last part of the fourth commandment where keeping the Sabbath is identified as a sign and an acknowledgment that God is the Creator of all. Could the worship of God by keeping His seventh day Sabbath constitute the seal of God in the last days? Verse 12 leaves no room for doubt when it says the saints will be keeping the commandments of God and the faith of Jesus, who Himself kept the commandments, <a href="/basics/sabbath/#did-jesus-keep-the-sabbath">including the fourth</a>. May we be found faithful in our stand for Jesus.</p></section>
