</blockquote><figcaption>— Acts 1:9-11</figcaption></figure><p>Jesus said He was going to heaven to prepare a place for His followers—promising that He would come again to take them to be with Him there. This promise was reaffirmed by the two angels who appeared to His disciples at His ascension. They said that Jesus would return in the same bodily and personal manner as they had seen Him go into heaven.</p></section>

<p>And there were voices, and thunders, and lightnings; and <em>there was a great earthquake, such as was not since men were upon the earth, so mighty an earthquake, and so great</em>. And the great city was divided into three parts, and the cities of the nations fell: and great Babylon came in remembrance before God, to give unto her the cup of the wine of the fierceness of his wrath. And <em>every island fled away, and the mountains were not found.

Together with the righteous who remain alive, they will be taken up to live with Him in heaven, never to be separated from Him again.</p><p>The earth, on the other hand, will be devastated by the most catastrophic earthquake and hailstorm since creation. Revelation says that the hailstones will each weigh about a talent—about 75 pounds—and that the earthquake will cause the islands and mountains to move out of their places.</p></section>

</blockquote><figcaption>— 2 Thessalonians 2:8-10</figcaption></figure><p>Because sin cannot exist in the presence of a holy God, the second coming will be a consuming fire to all who have rejected Jesus’ sacrifice on their behalf. Their rejection means they have never confessed their sins to Him, leaving Him unable to forgive and cover them with His perfect righteousness. As a result, they must bear the penalty for their sins themselves—the wages of which is death (<a href="https://bible-api.com/Romans%206%3A23?translation=kjv" class="verse-link" data-reference="Romans 6:23" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Romans 6:23</a>).</p></section>

<p>When the Lord shall have <em>washed away the filth</em> of the daughters of Zion, and shall have purged the blood of Jerusalem from the midst thereof by the spirit of judgment, and <em>by the spirit of burning</em>.</p>

<p>And such were some of you: but <em>ye are washed, but ye are sanctified, but ye are justified</em> in the name of the Lord Jesus, and <em>by the Spirit</em> of our God.</p>
</blockquote><figcaption>— 1 Corinthians 6:11</figcaption></figure><p>To reject Jesus is to reject the convictions of the Holy Spirit upon the mind, through whom He works to purge us from sin. This is why the two travelers to Emmaus felt their hearts “burning” with conviction after Jesus explained the Scriptures to them (<a href="https://bible-api.com/Luke%2024%3A32?translation=kjv" class="verse-link" data-reference="Luke 24:32" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Luke 24:32</a>).

Because the lost have rejected the promptings of the Holy Spirit, the second coming will bring destruction upon them, for Christ’s glorious holiness is a consuming fire to all whose sins have not already been purged by the indwelling presence of His Holy Spirit (<a href="https://bible-api.com/Psalm%2050%3A3-4?translation=kjv" class="verse-link" data-reference="Psalm 50:3-4" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Psalm 50:3-4</a>).</p></section>

<p>And I saw an angel come down from heaven, having the key of the bottomless pit and a great chain in his hand. And <em>he laid hold on the dragon, that old serpent, which is the Devil, and Satan, and bound him a thousand years</em>. And cast him into the bottomless pit, and shut him up, and set a seal upon him, that he should deceive the nations no more, till the thousand years should be fulfilled: and after that he must be loosed a little season. … And when the thousand years are expired, Satan shall be loosed out of his prison.</p>
</blockquote><figcaption>— Revelation 20:1-3, 7</figcaption></figure><p>The chain described here is a symbolic chain of circumstances, representing Satan’s confinement to the desolate earth, where he will have no one to tempt or deceive—for the saved will be in heaven, and the lost will be dead. For the first time since his rebellion in heaven, he will be completely deprived of his power—a condition that will last for a thousand years. It is noteworthy that the Greek word translated “bottomless pit” is <em>abussos</em> (abyss)—the same word used in <a href="https://bible-api.com/Genesis%201%3A2?translation=kjv" class="verse-link" data-reference="Genesis 1:2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Genesis 1:2</a> for “deep”. In other words, during this period, the earth will return to a chaotic, uninhabited state similar to its condition before Creation.</p></section>

<p>And it shall come to pass in that day, that the LORD shall <em>punish the host of the high ones that are on high</em>, and the kings of the earth upon the earth. And they shall be gathered together, as prisoners are gathered in the pit, and <em>shall be shut up in the prison</em>, and after many days shall they be visited.</p>
</blockquote><figcaption>— Isaiah 24:21-22</figcaption></figure><p>The fallen angels under Satan’s command—whom he first persuaded, by deception, to join his rebellion against God in heaven—will also be confined to the desolate earth with him. They will have ample time to reflect on their actions as they behold the devastation surrounding them—a constant reminder of the woeful consequences their rebellion has brought.</p><p>By the way, the parallels between <a href="https://bible-api.com/Isaiah%2024%3A21-22?translation=kjv" class="verse-link" data-reference="Isaiah 24:21-22" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Isaiah 24:21-22</a> and <a href="https://bible-api.com/Revelation%2020%3A1-3?translation=kjv" class="verse-link" data-reference="Revelation 20:1-3" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Revelation 20:1-3</a> are remarkable. Both passages use the words “pit” and “prison” and refer to an extended period of time: “when the thousand years are expired, Satan shall be loosed out of his prison,” and “after many days shall they be visited.” Together, they provide a textbook example of allowing Scripture to interpret itself, for the “many days” in Isaiah correspond to the thousand years in Revelation.</p></section>

For thus hath the LORD said, The <em>whole land shall be desolate</em>; yet will I not make a full end.</p>

<p>And when he was demanded of the Pharisees, when the kingdom of God should come, he answered them and said, <em>The kingdom of God cometh not with observation</em>: neither shall they say, Lo here! or, lo there! for, behold, <em>the kingdom of God is within you</em>.</p>

<p>For <em>when they shall say, Peace and safety; then sudden destruction cometh upon them</em>, as travail upon a woman with child; and they shall not escape.</p>
</blockquote><figcaption>— 1 Thessalonians 5:3</figcaption></figure><p>Scripture’s portrayal of the earth’s desolation shows that the belief in an earthly millennium following Christ’s return (known as dispensational premillennialism) is unbiblical. Another view, postmillennialism, holds that Christ will return <em>after</em> a millennial period in which Christianity prevails—particularly at the governmental level—throughout the world. This perspective is often embraced by Christian nationalists, but it too is unbiblical, for Christ declared that His kingdom is not of this world. In fact, when describing the end of the world, Jesus never spoke of a period of universal peace; after warning of nations in distress and people’s hearts failing from fear, He went directly to His coming in glory (<a href="https://bible-api.com/Luke%2021%3A25-27?translation=kjv" class="verse-link" data-reference="Luke 21:25-27" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Luke 21:25-27</a>). A heavenly millennium, therefore, is the only view that is consistent with all of Scripture.</p></section>

</blockquote><figcaption>— Revelation 20:4</figcaption></figure><figure><blockquote>
<p>Do ye not know that the <em>saints shall judge the world</em>? and if the world shall be judged by you, are ye unworthy to judge the smallest matters? Know ye not that <em>we shall judge angels</em>? how much more things that pertain to this life?</p>

</blockquote><figcaption>— Revelation 19:1-2</figcaption></figure><p>The saved from all ages will participate in the next phase of <a href="/prophecy/judgment/">judgment</a>, during which all their questions about God’s dealings with sin and sinners will be answered. They will not determine who is saved or lost, for God will have already decided that during the <a href="/prophecy/investigative/#who-is-being-judged-first">first phase</a>; rather, they will review the cases of all who are lost—including Satan and his angels.</p><p>Perhaps they will wonder why some people they expected to be there are missing, while others they did not expect are present. Maybe certain perplexing events or trying circumstances in their own lives caused them to question why God allowed these things to happen. To all of these perplexities—and more—God will provide perfectly satisfying answers, confirming the fairness of His judgment and motivating the redeemed to praise Him all the more for His infinite wisdom, love, and mercy.</p></section>

He will then level the Mount of Olives, creating a vast plain on which the city will rest. At that time, the second resurrection will occur—this time of the lost from all ages. Just as the resurrection of the saved marked the beginning of the millennium, so the resurrection of the lost will mark its close. For the first time in history, all who have ever lived since the creation of Adam and Eve will be gathered together—a vast, numberless multitude—for the third and final phase of the judgment.</p></section>

</blockquote><figcaption>— Luke 12:2-3</figcaption></figure><p>As the lost behold the glories of the New Jerusalem and realize that they are shut out of it, Satan succeeds in deceiving them one final time, persuading them to surround the city in a desperate attempt to capture it. After all, among the lost are great military leaders from every age—commanders who have never known defeat. But suddenly God’s throne appears, halting their attack and inaugurating the final phase of the judgment. The wicked will then see the record of their lives unfold before them and recognize that God did everything possible to draw them to Himself—to save them from their sins and prepare them to dwell in His holy presence. Yet they resisted Him, and without the sacrifice of Jesus covering their sins, they are left to bear the penalty for their own sins.</p></section>

This is the second death, from which there is no resurrection.

He did everything possible to save them, but they persistently rejected Him, leaving Him no other choice. The time has come to eradicate sin, for it cannot continue to exist unchecked, perpetuating pain, misery, and death throughout eternity.
