Revelation says the hail will weigh about a talent, which is about 75 pounds, and the earthquake will cause every island as well as the mountains to move out of its place!</p></section>

<p>And I saw heaven opened, and behold a white horse; and he that sat upon him was called Faithful and True, and in righteousness he doth judge and make war. <em>His eyes were as a flame of fire</em>, and on his head were many crowns; and he had a name written, that no man knew, but he himself. And he was clothed with a vesture dipped in blood: and his name is called The Word of God. And the armies which were in heaven followed him upon white horses, clothed in fine linen, white and clean. And out of his mouth goeth a sharp sword, that with it he should smite the nations: and he shall rule them with a rod of iron: and he treadeth the winepress of the fierceness and wrath of Almighty God. And he hath on his vesture and on his thigh a name written, KING OF KINGS, AND LORD OF LORDS.</p>
<p>And I saw an angel standing in the sun; and he cried with a loud voice, saying to all the fowls that fly in the midst of heaven, Come and gather yourselves together unto the supper of the great God; that ye may eat the flesh of kings, and the flesh of captains, and the flesh of mighty men, and the flesh of horses, and of them that sit on them, and the flesh of all men, both free and bond, both small and great.</p>
<p>And I saw the beast, and the kings of the earth, and their armies, gathered together to make war against him that sat on the horse, and against his army. And the beast was taken, and with him the false prophet that wrought miracles before him, with which he deceived them that had received the mark of the beast, and them that worshipped his image. These both were cast alive <em>into a lake of fire</em> burning with brimstone. And <em>the remnant were slain with the sword of him that sat upon the horse, which sword proceeded out of his mouth: and all the fowls were filled with their flesh</em>.</p>
</blockquote><figcaption>— Revelation 19:11-21</figcaption></figure><p>Because sin cannot exist in the presence of a holy God, to everyone who didn’t accept Jesus’ sacrifice on their behalf so He could cover their sins the second coming will be like a consuming fire because they will have to pay for their sins themselves. Revelation 19 uses symbolic imagery to describe how they will be destroyed by the brightness of His holy presence.</p></section>

</blockquote><figcaption>— Revelation 20:1-2</figcaption></figure><p>The chain described here is a symbolic chain of circumstances because Satan will be confined to planet earth without anyone to tempt or deceive since the saved are in heaven and the unsaved are dead, and for the first time since his rebellion in heaven, he is deprived of his power. This will be his fate for 1,000 years. It is interesting to note that the Greek word for “bottomless pit” is “abussos,” or abyss, and it is the same word used in (<a href="https://bible-api.com/Genesis%201%3A2?translation=kjv" class="verse-link" data-reference="Genesis 1:2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Genesis 1:2</a>) for the word “deep,” meaning the earth will resemble its original state during this time.</p></section>

</blockquote><figcaption>— Revelation 20:8-9</figcaption></figure><figure><blockquote>
<p>And <em>I saw a great white throne, and him that sat on it</em>, from whose face the earth and the heaven fled away; and there was found no place for them. And <em>I saw the dead, small and great, stand before God; and the books were opened</em>: and another book was opened, which is the book of life: and the <em>dead were judged out of those things which were written in the books, according to their works</em>.</p>
</blockquote><figcaption>— Revelation 20:11-12</figcaption></figure><figure><blockquote>
<p>For there is <em>nothing covered, that shall not be revealed; neither hid, that shall not be known</em>. Therefore whatsoever ye have spoken in darkness shall be heard in the light; and that which ye have spoken in the ear in closets shall be proclaimed upon the housetops.</p>
</blockquote><figcaption>— Luke 12:2-3</figcaption></figure><p>Satan manages to deceive the wicked, who realize they are shut out of the New Jerusalem, and persuades them to surround the city and attempt to capture it. But God’s throne will suddenly appear, bringing the attack to a halt and beginning the final phase of the judgment. The wicked will see their life pass before them and realize that God did everything He could to save them from their life of sin, but they did not heed Him, and without the sacrifice of Jesus covering their sins, they are left to pay for their own sins.</p></section>

<p>That <em>at the name of Jesus every knee should bow</em>, of things in heaven, and things in earth, and things under the earth; and that <em>every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord</em>, to the glory of God the Father.</p>
</blockquote><figcaption>— Philippians 2:10-11</figcaption></figure><p>All the wicked bow before God as they acknowledge that He has been fair, just, and longsuffering. After this acknowledgment, the controversy between good and evil will be settled, and it will be safe to eliminate sin and those who chose to cling to it.</p></section>

<p>And they went up on the breadth of the earth, and compassed the camp of the saints about, and the beloved city: and <em>fire came down from God out of heaven, and devoured them</em>. And the <em>devil that deceived them was cast into the lake of fire</em> and brimstone, where the beast and the false prophet are, and shall be tormented day and night for ever and ever.</p>
</blockquote><figcaption>— Revelation 20:9-10</figcaption></figure><figure><blockquote>
<p>And death and hell were cast into the lake of fire. This is the second death. And whosoever was not found written in the book of life was <em>cast into the lake of fire</em>.</p>
</blockquote><figcaption>— Revelation 20:14-15</figcaption></figure><figure><blockquote>
<p>Say unto them, As I live, saith the Lord GOD, <em>I have no pleasure in the death of the wicked</em>; but that the wicked turn from his way and live: <em>turn ye, turn ye from your evil ways; for why will ye die</em>, O house of Israel?</p>
</blockquote><figcaption>— Ezekiel 33:11</figcaption></figure><p>Fire then falls upon the wicked, as well as Satan and his angels, forming a lake of fire all around the New Jerusalem. This is the second death from which there is no resurrection, marking the end of the controversy between God and Satan, good and evil. For the God of love (<a href="https://bible-api.com/1%20John%204%3A8?translation=kjv" class="verse-link" data-reference="1 John 4:8" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">1 John 4:8</a>), this will be a difficult thing to watch because every single person who is destroyed is one whom He loved and for whom Jesus died. He did everything He could to save them, but they persistently rejected Him, and so He has no other option left. Once there is nothing but ashes left (<a href="https://bible-api.com/Malachi%204%3A3?translation=kjv" class="verse-link" data-reference="Malachi 4:3" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Malachi 4:3</a>), the fire will go out, and the universe will finally be free from sin.</p></section>
