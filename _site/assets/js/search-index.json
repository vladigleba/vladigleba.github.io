Using the correct form of baptism matters because any other form undermines the symbolism and meaning of baptism by immersion.

Biblical baptism illustrates that the Christian life is not merely about becoming a better person; it is about completely crucifying the old self (Galatians 2:20; 6:14). A failure to fully surrender every area of life to Jesus results in a baptism where the person is, in a sense, “buried alive”—a distortion that robs the believer of the rich blessings Jesus longs to give (John 15:11).\",\"type\":\"paragraph\"},{\"id\":\"heading-7\",\"text\":\"What else accompanies water baptism?\",\"type\":\"heading\"},{\"id\":\"blockquote-15\",\"text\":\"Jesus answered, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born of water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God. —John 3:5\",\"type\":\"blockquote\"},{\"id\":\"paragraph-8\",\"text\":\"In addition to water baptism, every sincere Christian will also receive the baptism of the Holy Spirit, since full immersion in water is merely a visible manifestation of the inward immersion by the Holy Spirit.

It is to the Christian what a wedding is to marriage—a public declaration of commitment.

This aligns with the commission Jesus gave His disciples just before His ascension: to share His teachings throughout the world and to baptize those who accept them and believe in Him. Naturally, His teachings will bring conviction of sin, leading the genuine believer to repent of past sins (Acts 5:31) and to choose no longer to serve sin, but to die to self through the power of the Holy Spirit.

Prior to the rise of their movement in 1525, infant baptism was the norm across Christendom; the Anabaptists, however, believed that infants are incapable of understanding the gospel or demonstrating the repentance and faith that accompany it. They were ruthlessly persecuted for these beliefs by both Protestants and Catholics alike. For instance, on March 7, 1526, the city council of Zurich—a Protestant stronghold—passed an edict proclaiming the death sentence (by drowning) upon them. Persecution was fierce because baptism was not merely a religious issue but also a civil one. At the heart of the matter was the issue of liberty of conscience—the right to think for oneself—which was a radical idea at the time, threatening the stability of the civil order. Their persecution continued even after the 1648 Peace of Westphalia gave Lutherans and Calvinists official recognition, forcing the Anabaptists to seek reprieve through emigration to America. Today, their descendants include the Mennonites and the Amish, yet we all benefit from the courageous stand they took in offering up their lives for liberty of conscience—especially those living in the United States—because their stand was eventually enshrined in the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.\",\"type\":\"footnote\"},{\"id\":\"heading-9\",\"text\":\"What about the thief on the cross?\",\"type\":\"heading\"},{\"id\":\"blockquote-20\",\"text\":\"And one of the malefactors which were hanged railed on him, saying, If thou be Christ, save thyself and us.

If you are consistent with your own principles, if you really follow the Bible and the Bible only, you ought to be able to produce some portion of the New Testament in which this fourth commandment is expressly altered. {% ct \\\"Library of Christian Doctrine: Why Don't You Keep Holy the Sabbath-Day?

When God’s people are sealed, they make an unwavering decision to honor the authority of His law as supreme—above the laws of men—no matter the cost. Their hearts are so knit with their Father’s that they would rather die than disobey their Maker (Revelation 12:11). This is not a works-based, legalistic religion, but a love-driven loyalty—by His grace through faith—to the One who risked all to save us. It is a faith that works.

Now it is important to emphasize that this is not a condemnation of Roman Catholics; rather, the Bible is pointing out a system—Catholicism. In other places the Bible also points out the faults of the Jewish and Protestant faiths. Moreover, God has devoted Christians in all churches, including the Roman Catholic church. It is also true that the papacy has done many good deeds for the poor and the needy, but she has also committed serious errors that the Bible clearly points out in Daniel and in Revelation. God must sometimes chasten and rebuke because He wants us to be aware of error and compromise, and people who are truly loyal to Him will heed His warnings, no matter the faith. With this in mind, let’s examine each of the nine characteristics:\",\"type\":\"paragraph\"},{\"id\":\"list-1\",\"text\":\"1. It came up among the 10 kingdoms of Western Europe.

Most of the 10 kingdoms of Western Europe supported the papacy, but three of them did not: the Heruli, the Ostrogoths, and the Vandals. These had to be destroyed before the papacy could rise to power. The Heruli were eradicated in 493, the Vandals in 534, and the power of the Ostrogoths was curtailed in 538.\",\"type\":\"list\"},{\"id\":\"list-4\",\"text\":\"1. It would emerge from the fourth kingdom—the pagan Roman Empire. The papacy is a continuation of the pagan Roman Empire, and historians attest to this. “The mighty Catholic Church was little more than the Roman Empire baptized. … The very capital of the old Roman Empire became the capital of the Christian empire. The office of Pontifex Maximus was continued in that of the pope.” “Whatever Roman elements the barbarians and Arians left … [came] under the protection of the Bishop of Rome, who was the chief person there after the emperor’s disappearance. … The Roman church … pushed itself into the place of the Roman World-Empire, of which it is the actual continuation.”\",\"type\":\"list\"},{\"id\":\"list-5\",\"text\":\"1. It would make war with the saints. It is no secret that the Roman Catholic church killed millions of people whose religious convictions differed from hers, especially during the Dark Ages. “That the Church of Rome has shed more innocent blood than any other institution that has ever existed among mankind, will be questioned by no Protestant who has a competent knowledge of history.”\",\"type\":\"list\"},{\"id\":\"list-6\",\"text\":\"1. It would be different from the 10 other kingdoms. The papacy is different from the other secular powers in Europe in that it rose to power as a religious power.\",\"type\":\"list\"},{\"id\":\"list-7\",\"text\":\"1. It would persecute the saints for “a time and times and the dividing of time.” In the Bible a time is a year, times is two years, and half a time is half of a year, so this is a total of three and a half years. The Amplified Bible actually translates it as “three and one-half years.” This same period is also mentioned as 42 months in Revelation 11:2; 13:5, as well as 1,260 days in Revelation 11:3; 12:6, 14 (the Jewish calendar is 30 days). In the Bible one prophetic day equals one literal year (Ezekiel 4:6; Numbers 14:34), so the little horn would have power to persecute the saints for 1,260 years. The papacy gained this power in 538 when the Ostrogoths, the last of the opposing kingdoms, were uprooted, and it ruled until 1798 when Napoleon’s general, Berthier, took the pope captive. Thus, its 1,260 year rule from 538 to 1798 is a direct fulfillment of this prophecy. Matthew 24:21-22 mentions this period of persecution against the saints, saying no soul would have survived it if God did not shorten it, but He did shorten it, and the persecution ended well before 1798.\",\"type\":\"list\"},{\"id\":\"list-8\",\"text\":\"1. It would “speak great words against” (blaspheme) God. Daniel 7:25 (“speak great words against the most High”) is echoed by Revelation 13:5 (“speaking great things and blasphemies”), so speaking great words is equivalent to blasphemy, which has two definitions in the Bible: claiming to forgive sins (Luke 5:21), and claiming to be God (John 10:33). The papacy claims both of these things. “Does the Priest truly forgive the sins, or does he only declare that they are remitted? The Priest does really and truly forgive the sins in virtue of the power given to him by Christ.” “We [the popes] hold upon this earth the place of God Almighty.” “The pope is not only the representative of Jesus Christ, but he is Jesus Christ, Himself, hidden under the veil of flesh.”\",\"type\":\"list\"},{\"id\":\"list-9\",\"text\":\"1. It would attempt “to change times and laws.” This is a reference to the law of God, and there is only one commandment that is both a time and a law: the fourth commandment about keeping the seventh day Sabbath holy. Furthermore, there is also only one Lawgiver (James 4:12), the Creator of heaven and earth, and no one can actually change the law of God (Luke 16:17), but the papacy has thought to transfer the Sabbath from Saturday to Sunday, the first day of the week. In its catechisms, it has also removed the second commandment against the veneration of images, shortened the fourth commandment, and divided the tenth commandment into two. In other words, there are now two apparent lawgivers, with two different days of worship, but only one of them is legitimate—the seventh-day Sabbath of the Almighty God.\",\"type\":\"list\"},{\"id\":\"paragraph-9\",\"text\":\"There is no other organization but the papacy that fits all nine of the characteristics of the little horn power of Daniel 7.

Now it’s worth repeating that this is not a condemnation of Roman Catholics; rather, the Bible is pointing out a system—Catholicism. In other places the Bible also points out the faults of the Jewish and Protestant faiths. Moreover, God has devoted Christians in all churches, including the Roman Catholic church. It’s also true that the papacy has done many good deeds for the poor and the needy, but she has also committed serious errors that the Bible clearly points out in Daniel and in Revelation. God must sometimes chasten and rebuke because He wants us to be aware of error and compromise, and people who are truly loyal to Him will heed His warnings, no matter the faith.

It is the composite of the four beasts of Daniel 7. The beast is the composite of these beasts (Daniel 7:4-7) because it incorporates various beliefs and practices from all four empires, and the papacy fits this point too. “In a certain respect, she [the papacy] has copied her organization from that of the Roman Empire, has preserved and made fruitful the philosophical intuitions of Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle, borrowed from both Barbarians and the Byzantine Roman Empire, but always remains herself, thoroughly digesting all elements drawn from external sources.”\",\"type\":\"list\"},{\"id\":\"list-3\",\"text\":\"1. The dragon gives it power and authority. The dragon can be identified by reading Revelation 12:1-6 where it talks about a pregnant woman about to deliver and the dragon hoping to devour the baby at birth; however, the child evades the dragon by being caught up to heaven. This is an obvious reference to Jesus, whom Herod tried to kill by slaying all the babies in Bethlehem (Matthew 2:16). Herod was acting under his authority as a king of Rome, so the dragon represents pagan Rome, but the real power behind Herod’s plot was the devil (Revelation 12:7-9) who likes to act through various governments to move his ugly work forward. The Roman Empire eventually fell in 476, and its power and capital city were inherited by the papacy. “The Roman Church … pushed itself into the place of the Roman World-Empire, of which it is the actual continuation. … The Pope … is Caesar’s successor.” “The mighty Catholic Church was little more than the Roman Empire baptised. Rome was transformed as well as converted. The very capital of the old Empire became the capital of the Christian Empire.

Even though Vatican City is the smallest country in the world, it now has ambassadors (called “papal nuncios”) in every part of the globe.

A failure to fully surrender every area of life to Jesus results in a baptism where the person is, in a sense, “buried alive”—a distortion that robs the believer of the rich blessings Jesus longs to give (John 15:11).",

They were ruthlessly persecuted for these beliefs by both Protestants and Catholics alike. For instance, on March 7, 1526, the city council of Zurich—a Protestant stronghold—passed an edict proclaiming the death sentence (by drowning) upon them. Persecution was fierce because baptism was not merely a religious issue but also a civil one. At the heart of the matter was the issue of liberty of conscience—the right to think for oneself—which was a radical idea at the time, threatening the stability of the civil order. Their persecution continued even after the 1648 Peace of Westphalia gave Lutherans and Calvinists official recognition, forcing the Anabaptists to seek reprieve through emigration to America. Today, their descendants include the Mennonites and the Amish, yet we all benefit from the courageous stand they took in offering up their lives for liberty of conscience—especially those living in the United States—because their stand was eventually enshrined in the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.",

He raiseth up the poor out of the dust, and lifteth the needy out of the dunghill; that he may set him with princes, even with the princes of his people. —Psalm 113:1-8",

It is also true that the papacy has done many good deeds for the poor and the needy, but she has also committed serious errors that the Bible clearly points out in Daniel and in Revelation.

In the Bible one prophetic day equals one literal year (Ezekiel 4:6; Numbers 14:34), so the little horn would have power to persecute the saints for 1,260 years. The papacy gained this power in 538 when the Ostrogoths, the last of the opposing kingdoms, were uprooted, and it ruled until 1798 when Napoleon’s general, Berthier, took the pope captive. Thus, its 1,260 year rule from 538 to 1798 is a direct fulfillment of this prophecy. Matthew 24:21-22 mentions this period of persecution against the saints, saying no soul would have survived it if God did not shorten it, but He did shorten it, and the persecution ended well before 1798.",

The papacy claims both of these things. “Does the Priest truly forgive the sins, or does he only declare that they are remitted? The Priest does really and truly forgive the sins in virtue of the power given to him by Christ.” “We [the popes] hold upon this earth the place of God Almighty.” “The pope is not only the representative of Jesus Christ, but he is Jesus Christ, Himself, hidden under the veil of flesh.”",

In its catechisms, it has also removed the second commandment against the veneration of images, shortened the fourth commandment, and divided the tenth commandment into two.

Its religion was characterized by idolatry, ancestor worship, and sun worship, and it became an enemy of God’s people, Israel (Jeremiah 39:6-7; 50:29-34; 51:34). Babylon was also marked by a boastful and prideful spirit, as seen in the Babylonian king’s boastful remark in Daniel 4:30. In fact, in Isaiah 14:4-22, God uses Babylon as a symbol of Satan due to its pride and wickedness.",

It is also true that the papacy has done many good deeds for the poor and the needy, but she has also committed serious errors that the Bible clearly points out in Daniel and in Revelation. God must sometimes chasten and rebuke because He wants us to be aware of error and compromise, and people who are truly loyal to Him will heed His warnings, no matter the faith.

By the nature of things, the power of sovereigns is confined to political government. They have no right of punishment but over those who disturb the public peace.

Now it’s worth repeating that this is not a condemnation of Roman Catholics; rather, the Bible is pointing out a system—Catholicism. In other places the Bible also points out the faults of the Jewish and Protestant faiths. Moreover, God has devoted Christians in all churches, including the Roman Catholic church. It’s also true that the papacy has done many good deeds for the poor and the needy, but she has also committed serious errors that the Bible clearly points out in Daniel and in Revelation. God must sometimes chasten and rebuke because He wants us to be aware of error and compromise, and people who are truly loyal to Him will heed His warnings, no matter the faith.

In other words, the mark of the beast is a marking of oneself by accepting the beast’s mark, Sunday, either through conviction or actions, as opposed to God’s seal, the true seventh day Sabbath.

The conflict between God and Lucifer started in heaven over the issue of worship because Lucifer wanted to be worshiped like the Creator God, and it’s clear that worship will be central in the last days too. Will I worship the Creator God by observing His Sabbath or the beast by observing his counterfeit Sunday?

Millions died for their faith at the hands of the papacy, but God did not allow His church to be totally obliterated because the truth had to be preserved.

But this trend will not be universal. Communities of genuine followers of Christ will exist throughout the world who reflect His character. Specifically, they will be known for their love—which is, in fact, the love of God manifested in them (John 13:35; 1 John 2:5). Thus, in the end, there will be only two classes of people: those who give themselves over to sin, selfishness, and evil, and those who give themselves over to God’s loving mercy and enabling grace.

A sound of thunder was heard underground, and immediately afterward a violent shock threw down the greater part of that city. In the course of about six minutes, sixty thousand persons perished. The sea first retired, and laid the bar dry; it then rolled in, rising fifty feet above its ordinary level. The mountains of Arrabida, Estrella, Julio, Marvan, and Cintra, being some of the largest in Portugal, were impetuously shaken, as it were from their very foundations; and some of them opened at their summits, which were split and rent in a wonderful manner, huge masses of them being thrown down into the subjacent valleys. Flames are related to have issued from these mountains, which are supposed to have been electric; they are also said to have smoked; but vast clouds of dust may have given rise to this appearance.”",

An eyewitness in Massachusetts described the scene: “Fear, anxiety, and awe gradually filled the minds of the people. Women stood at the door, looking out upon the dark landscape; men returned from their labor in the fields; the carpenter left his tools, the blacksmith his forge, the tradesman his counter. Schools were dismissed, and tremblingly the children fled homeward. Travelers put up at the nearest farmhouse. ‘What is coming?’ queried every lip and heart. It seemed as if a hurricane was about to dash across the land, or as if it was the day of the consummation of all things. Candles were used; and hearth fires shone as brightly as on a moonless evening in autumn…. Fowls retired to their roosts and went to sleep, cattle gathered at the pasture bars and lowed, frogs peeped, birds sang their evening songs, and bats flew about.

Now this Protest opposes two abuses of man in matters of faith: the first is the intrusion of the civil magistrate, and the second the arbitrary authority of the church. Instead of these abuses, Protestantism sets the power of conscience above the magistrate, and the authority of the word of God above the visible church. In the first place, it rejects the civil power in divine things, and says with the prophets and apostles, ‘We must obey God rather than man.’ In presence of the crown of Charles the Fifth, it uplifts the crown of Jesus Christ. But it goes farther: it lays down the principle that all human teaching should be subordinate to the oracles of God.” —Merle d’Aubigné, History of the Reformation, Book 13, Chapter 6, Paragraph 18.",

That same year, Congress passed legislation requiring the World’s Columbian Exposition to close on Sundays in honor of Sunday observance, a mandate endorsed by President Benjamin Harrison, who made government funding for the fair conditional on Sunday closure. As a result, only 101 years after the ratification of the First Amendment, which established the separation of church and state, all three branches of the United States government had effectively repudiated that principle. Today, many states already have “blue laws” that restrict commerce on Sundays, based on the Supreme Court’s 1961 ruling in McGowan v.

Moreover, they will recognize it is not Jesus, because according to the Bible, He will not touch the earth at His second coming but will remain in the clouds to meet His people in the air (1 Thessalonians 4:16-17).",

This message will expose Satan’s deceptions so that every person will be informed about God’s true Sabbath and warned against receiving the mark of the beast—the counterfeit Sunday— because this decision carries eternal consequences. Those who choose to obey—and thus worship—the beast by honoring his man-made “holy” day will receive his mark, by which they cut themselves off from God’s mercy and exclude themselves from His eternal kingdom. But there will also be those who join God’s side, choosing to worship Him on His holy day. Through faith, Jesus’ sacrifice on the cross will cover their confessed and forsaken sins, and His grace will transform them into obedient followers, sealing them for eternity (Revelation 7:2-3).",
