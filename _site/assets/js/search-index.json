In fact, the book of Mark makes an inextricable connection between believing in Jesus and being baptized, which shows that baptism is an integral part of the Christian experience. Why is baptism important? “Jesus answered, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born of water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God.” —John 3:5 “That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved. For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation.” —Romans 10:9-10 “For as many of you as have been baptized into Christ have put on Christ.” —Galatians 3:27 During His conversation with Nicodemus, Jesus emphasized that to be born again is to be born of water and the Spirit. In doing so, He made it clear that baptism is a privilege and a responsibility that all Christians are called to experience. Salvation is a gift from God, received through faith in Jesus Christ (Ephesians 2:8-9), and this faith is demonstrated through a public, unashamed confession of Him (Romans 10:9-10; Luke 12:8-9; 2 Timothy 1:12). At baptism, we make an open declaration to all present that we have accepted Him as Lord and Savior, been clothed with the robe of His righteousness (Galatians 3:27; Isaiah 61:10), and have taken on a new name and identity: follower of Christ, son or daughter of God! By making a public stand for Christ, we also become His witnesses to others, inspiring them to do the same in their own lives. What does baptism replace? “In whom also ye are circumcised with the circumcision made without hands, in putting off the body of the sins of the flesh by the circumcision of Christ: buried with him in baptism, wherein also ye are risen with him through the faith of the operation of God, who hath raised him from the dead. And you, being dead in your sins and the uncircumcision of your flesh, hath he quickened together with him, having forgiven you all trespasses.” —Colossians 2:11-13 In the Old Testament, circumcision was an outward covenant sign of an inward reality—a change of heart (Romans 2:28-29; Deuteronomy 30:6). It pointed forward to sin being “cut off”—forgiven and overcome—through Christ. In the New Testament, baptism is an outward covenant sign of the same reality: His death on the cross paid the penalty for our sins, opening the way to forgiveness, while His perfect life overcame the power of sin, opening the way to victory in our own lives, since the sins He overcame were our sins, and He did so in our flesh (1 Peter 2:24; Romans 8:3-4). How many methods of baptism are there? “There is one body, and one Spirit, even as ye are called in one hope of your calling; one Lord, one faith, one baptism, one God and Father of all, who is above all, and through all, and in you all.” —Ephesians 4:4-6 The Bible declares that there is only one true baptism, and the word itself offers a clue as to what it involves. The term “baptize” comes from the Greek word baptizō, which means “to immerse,” “to submerge,” or “to dip under.” This might come as a surprise to some, but the Bible never describes baptism using the words “sprinkle” or “pour.” Biblical baptism is a full immersion in water. How was Jesus baptized? “And John also was baptizing in Aenon near to Salim, because there was much water there: and they came, and were baptized.” —John 3:23 “Then cometh Jesus from Galilee to Jordan unto John, to be baptized of him. But John forbad him, saying, I have need to be baptized of thee, and comest thou to me? And Jesus answering said unto him, Suffer it to be so now: for thus it becometh us to fulfil all righteousness. Then he suffered him. And Jesus, when he was baptized, went up straightway out of the water: and, lo, the heavens were opened unto him, and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove, and lighting upon him: and lo a voice from heaven, saying, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.” —Matthew 3:13-17 “And it came to pass in those days, that Jesus came from Nazareth of Galilee, and was baptized of John in Jordan. And straightway coming up out of the water, he saw the heavens opened, and the Spirit like a dove descending upon him.” —Mark 1:9-10 John the Baptist chose an area with plenty of water because he practiced the biblical form of baptism—full immersion. Both Matthew and Mark make it clear that this was the type of baptism Jesus received, as they describe Him “coming up out of the water,” indicating that He had first gone down into the water to be baptized. Are there other examples of baptism? “And he commanded the chariot to stand still: and they went down both into the water, both Philip and the eunuch; and he baptized him. And when they were come up out of the water, the Spirit of the Lord caught away Philip, that the eunuch saw him no more: and he went on his way rejoicing.” —Acts 8:38-39 The Bible gives the example of Philip and the Ethiopian eunuch to show that Jesus’ disciples did not change the method of baptism after His ascension. Both Philip and the eunuch went down into the water, and after Philip baptized him, they came up out of the water. This mirrors the description and form of baptism that Jesus Himself received. What does baptism represent? “And now why tarriest thou? arise, and be baptized, and wash away thy sins, calling on the name of the Lord.” —Acts 22:16 “Buried with him in baptism, wherein also ye are risen with him through the faith of the operation of God, who hath raised him from the dead.” —Colossians 2:12 “Know ye not, that so many of us as were baptized into Jesus Christ were baptized into his death? Therefore we are buried with him by baptism into death: that like as Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the Father, even so we also should walk in newness of life. For if we have been planted together in the likeness of his death, we shall be also in the likeness of his resurrection: Knowing this, that our old man is crucified with him, that the body of sin might be destroyed, that henceforth we should not serve sin.” —Romans 6:3-6 “That ye put off concerning the former conversation the old man, which is corrupt according to the deceitful lusts; and be renewed in the spirit of your mind; and that ye put on the new man, which after God is created in righteousness and true holiness.” —Ephesians 4:22-24 Generally speaking, baptism is a symbol of cleansing from sin, which every person needs, as all have sinned (Romans 3:23). More specifically, it symbolizes the death and burial of the old life of sin and the birth of a new life in Jesus. In other words, it represents Jesus’ death, burial, and resurrection. As we experience His selfless love for us, we are motivated: 1. to die to sin in our own lives, which involves dying to self, 2. to bury that old life under the water in baptism, and 3. to rise to a new life in Jesus by the power of His Holy Spirit. Baptism is a beautiful and powerful symbol of how Jesus’ death, burial, and resurrection replace our old identity with a completely new one in Him. Using the correct form of baptism matters because any other form undermines the symbolism and meaning of baptism by immersion. Alternative forms portray a vastly different spiritual reality—one that does not reflect the burial of the old life. Biblical baptism illustrates that the Christian life is not merely about becoming a better person; it is about completely crucifying the old self (Galatians 2:20; 6:14). A failure to fully surrender every area of life to Jesus results in a baptism where the person is, in a sense, “buried alive”—a distortion that robs the believer of the rich blessings Jesus longs to give (John 15:11). What else accompanies water baptism? “Jesus answered, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born of water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God.” —John 3:5 In addition to water baptism, every sincere Christian will also receive the baptism of the Holy Spirit, since full immersion in water is merely a visible manifestation of the inward immersion by the Holy Spirit. The good news is that God is more than willing to give His Spirit to anyone who asks (Luke 11:13). Those who desire to be transformed in life and character by the Spirit will receive Him, and He, in turn, will convict them of sin and bestow the righteousness of Jesus upon them (John 16:8; Titus 3:3-7). The baptism of the Holy Spirit is absolutely essential; without Him, we cannot change ourselves (Jeremiah 13:23). Evidence of receiving the baptism of the Spirit includes producing the fruit of the Spirit described in Galatians 5:22-23, as well as receiving His gifts—both of which enable us to be effective ambassadors for God (2 Corinthians 5:19-21). How do I know if I’m ready for baptism? “Go ye therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost: teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you: and, lo, I am with you alway, even unto the end of the world.” —Matthew 28:19-20 “He that believeth and is baptized shall be saved; but he that believeth not shall be damned.” —Mark 16:16 “Then Peter said unto them, Repent, and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins, and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost.” —Acts 2:38 “For if we have been planted together in the likeness of his death, we shall be also in the likeness of his resurrection: knowing this, that our old man is crucified with him, that the body of sin might be destroyed, that henceforth we should not serve sin.” —Romans 6:5-6 Baptism is an outward sign of an inward change of heart. It is to the Christian what a wedding is to marriage—a public declaration of commitment. Because baptism represents a commitment to Jesus as one’s personal Savior (Acts 8:37), it is vital to first come to know Him and understand His teachings. This aligns with the commission Jesus gave His disciples just before His ascension: to share His teachings throughout the world and to baptize those who accept them and believe in Him. Naturally, His teachings will bring conviction of sin, leading the genuine believer to repent of past sins (Acts 5:31) and to choose no longer to serve sin, but to die to self through the power of the Holy Spirit. This experience is known as being born of the Spirit (born again), and when it is present in a believer’s life, that person is ready to make the exciting—yet serious—public commitment to be faithful to Jesus, even to the point of death. Incidentally, this means that infant baptism is not appropriate, because an infant is not mature enough to understand the prerequisites or make the commitment. After all, Jesus Himself was baptized as an adult. Instead of being baptized, infants can be dedicated to God by their parents—as Jesus was (Luke 2:21-39)—while the parents also dedicate themselves to doing all they can to raise a child who knows and loves God and will one day make that baptismal commitment. The Bible, however, does not specify a particular age for baptism, because every person’s spiritual experience and maturity are different. Adult baptism, also known as believer’s baptism, was rediscovered by the Anabaptists (“re-baptizers”) during the Protestant Reformation. Prior to the rise of their movement in 1525, infant baptism was the norm across Christendom; the Anabaptists, however, believed that infants are incapable of understanding the gospel or demonstrating the repentance and faith that accompany it. They were ruthlessly persecuted for these beliefs by both Protestants and Catholics alike. For instance, on March 7, 1526, the city council of Zurich—a Protestant stronghold—passed an edict proclaiming the death sentence (by drowning) upon them. Persecution was fierce because baptism was not merely a religious issue but also a civil one. At the heart of the matter was the issue of liberty of conscience—the right to think for oneself—which was a radical idea at the time, threatening the stability of the civil order. Their persecution continued even after the 1648 Peace of Westphalia gave Lutherans and Calvinists official recognition, forcing the Anabaptists to seek reprieve through emigration to America. Today, their descendants include the Mennonites and the Amish, yet we all benefit from the courageous stand they took in offering up their lives for liberty of conscience—especially those living in the United States—because their stand was eventually enshrined in the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. What about the thief on the cross? “And one of the malefactors which were hanged railed on him, saying, If thou be Christ, save thyself and us. But the other answering rebuked him, saying, Dost not thou fear God, seeing thou art in the same condemnation? And we indeed justly; for we receive the due reward of our deeds: but this man hath done nothing amiss. And he said unto Jesus, Lord, remember me when thou comest into thy kingdom.” —Luke 23:39-42 The conversion of the thief on the cross demonstrates that there can be unique circumstances which prevent a person from being baptized by immersion. In such cases, the baptism of Jesus is counted on their behalf. However, this is not an excuse for someone who is able but unwilling to be baptized. Baptism remains a vital public commitment to Jesus. What does baptism not do? “For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God:” —Ephesians 2:8 It is important to note that we are not saved by baptism, as salvation is by grace through faith; however, baptism is an act of obedience to Jesus, born out of a conversion marked by genuine love for and gratitude to Him. Baptism does not remove temptation either, but God promises that we will not be tempted beyond what we are able to bear; He will always provide a way of escape (1 Corinthians 10:13). Finally, baptism itself does not change the heart—it is a symbol of a heart already transformed by the power of the Holy Spirit. What is baptism connected with? “Then they that gladly received his word were baptized: and the same day there were added unto them about three thousand souls. And they continued stedfastly in the apostles’ doctrine and fellowship, and in breaking of bread, and in prayers. … And they, continuing daily with one accord in the temple, and breaking bread from house to house, did eat their meat with gladness and singleness of heart, praising God, and having favour with all the people. And the Lord added to the church daily such as should be saved.” —Acts 2:41-42, 46-47 “And He is the head of the body, the church, who is the beginning, the firstborn from the dead, that in all things He may have the preeminence.” —Colossians 1:18 “For by one Spirit are we all baptized into one body, whether we be Jews or Gentiles, whether we be bond or free; and have been all made to drink into one Spirit.” —1 Corinthians 12:13 When the disciples began proclaiming the teachings of Jesus, those who believed and were baptized became part of the body of Christ—His church—of which He is Lord. The church is a community of Christ’s followers who nurture one another’s walk with God, work together to serve others, and spread the good news of the gospel. A decision for baptism, therefore, comes with the blessing of fellowship with other believers who accept all of Jesus’ teachings as revealed in the Bible and, by the power of the Holy Spirit, seek to live them out. Can a person be rebaptized? “He said unto them, Have ye received the Holy Ghost since ye believed? And they said unto him, We have not so much as heard whether there be any Holy Ghost. And he said unto them, Unto what then were ye baptized? And they said, Unto John’s baptism. Then said Paul, John verily baptized with the baptism of repentance, saying unto the people, that they should believe on him which should come after him, that is, on Christ Jesus. When they heard this, they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus.” —Acts 19:2-5 Rebaptism may be appropriate when new truth is discovered, as was the case with the group of believers who had been baptized by John but had never heard of the Holy Spirit. After learning this life-changing truth, they were so deeply impacted that they chose to be rebaptized. Another situation in which rebaptism is fitting is when a person desires to return to Jesus after having turned away from Him. Baptism is like a marriage ceremony with Jesus; so if genuine love has been rekindled in the heart—and it is accompanied by a renewed commitment to be faithful through both good times and bad—it can be appropriate to make a new public pledge to Him. Who has the authority to baptize? “Then the eleven disciples went away into Galilee, into a mountain where Jesus had appointed them. And when they saw him, they worshipped him: but some doubted. And Jesus came and spake unto them, saying, All power is given unto me in heaven and in earth. Go ye therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost: teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you: and, lo, I am with you alway, even unto the end of the world.” —Matthew 28:16-20 Jesus gave the authority to baptize exclusively to His disciples, whom He commissioned to faithfully teach all the truths He had commanded them. Therefore, when the Holy Spirit leads someone to seek baptism, it is important to find a church that teaches the full scope of Jesus’ teachings and to request that the church’s ordained male pastor—the modern equivalent of an ordained disciple—perform the baptism. By limiting baptismal authority to ordained pastors, Jesus established a structure designed to uphold the truths He entrusted to His Church and to safeguard her from compromise with error. Is it wise to put off baptism? “And now why tarriest thou? arise, and be baptized, and wash away thy sins, calling on the name of the Lord.” —Acts 22:16 “And as he reasoned of righteousness, temperance, and judgment to come, Felix trembled, and answered, Go thy way for this time; when I have a convenient season, I will call for thee.” —Acts 24:25 When the Holy Spirit brings conviction to the heart, one of Satan’s most effective strategies is to tempt that person to delay their decision until a more convenient time—a time that never comes. Postponing baptism because of a feeling of not being “good enough” is unwise. We begin our Christian walk as spiritual infants, not mature adults, and if babies waited to attempt walking until they were certain they would never fall, they would never learn to walk. So if the Holy Spirit is prompting you to be baptized, the Bible invites you to make plans today—without delay. How does God feel about a baptized person? “I say unto you, that likewise joy shall be in heaven over one sinner that repenteth, more than over ninety and nine just persons, which need no repentance.” —Luke 15:7 “In that day it shall be said to Jerusalem: “Do not fear; Zion, let not your hands be weak. The Lord your God in your midst, the Mighty One, will save; He will rejoice over you with gladness, He will quiet you with His love, He will rejoice over you with singing.”” —Zephaniah 3:16-17, NKJV Not only is there joy in heaven over every repentant sinner, but Zephaniah tells us that God Himself rejoices in song over His people! The truth is, we have the ability to make heaven rejoice, and stepping into the waters of baptism to make a public commitment to Jesus is sure to bring melodies of joy to the heavenly courts.\",\"series\":\"Baptized by the Spirit\"},\"1\":{\"title\":\"Can I Trust the Bible?\",\"url\":\"/basics/bible/\",\"category\":\"Basics\",\"description\":\"Is the Bible a fable, or is it the most trustworthy document we have ever possessed?\",\"body\":\"How much of the Bible is inspired? By whom? For what purpose? “All Scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness, that the man of God may be perfect, thoroughly furnished unto all good works.” —2 Timothy 3:16-17 How did it maintain its miraculous unity? “Knowing this first, that no prophecy of the scripture is of any private interpretation. For the prophecy came not in old time by the will of man: but holy men of God spake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost.” —2 Peter 1:20-21 The Bible was written over a period of 1,500 years by about 40 different authors whose education and background varied greatly. The Bible’s unity under these circumstances is astonishing and can only be explained by divine inspiration. Can the Bible be trusted? “Thy word is true from the beginning, and every one of thy righteous judgments endureth for ever.” —Psalm 119:160 Hasn’t it been corrupted over the ages? “The words of the LORD are pure words, as silver tried in a furnace of earth, purified seven times. Thou shalt keep them, O LORD, thou shalt preserve them from this generation for ever.” —Psalm 12:6-7 God’s word is truth, and He will ensure it stays that way. Can God’s Word be changed or done away with? “Heaven and earth shall pass away, but my words shall not pass away.” —Matthew 24:35 “For all flesh is as grass, and all the glory of man as the flower of grass. The grass withereth, and the flower thereof falleth away: but the word of the LORD endureth for ever. And this is the word which by the gospel is preached unto you.” —1 Peter 1:24-25 Why did God give us the Scriptures? “For whatsoever things were written aforetime were written for our learning, that we through patience and comfort of the scriptures might have hope.” —Romans 15:4 “For this is good and acceptable in the sight of God our Savior, who will have all men to be saved, and to come unto the knowledge of the truth.” —1 Timothy 2:3-4 “And that from a child thou hast known the holy scriptures, which are able to make thee wise unto salvation through faith which is in Christ Jesus.” —2 Timothy 3:15 God gave us the Scriptures so we can learn about His character and be grounded in His truth while navigating a world of deception, so that through it we might be saved from sin and have hope of eternal life. Who do the Scriptures point me to? “Search the scriptures; for in them ye think ye have eternal life: and they are they which testify of me.” —John 5:39 “Looking unto Jesus the author and finisher of our faith; who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross, despising the shame, and is set down at the right hand of the throne of God.” —Hebrews 12:2 “Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.” —John 14:6 All the stories of the Bible point me to Jesus, the Author and Finisher of my faith. How can I be blessed by the Bible? “Study to shew thyself approved unto God, a workman that needeth not to be ashamed, rightly dividing the word of truth.” —2 Timothy 2:15 “These were more noble than those in Thessalonica, in that they received the word with all readiness of mind, and searched the scriptures daily, whether those things were so.” —Acts 17:11 The Bible is unlike any other book because it is my Creator and Redeemer’s special gift to me. He speaks to me through it, and it is my privilege to read it daily because by doing so I’ll draw closer to Him. Every relationship is built on spending quality time together, and my relationship with Jesus is no different. Is God’s Word as important as physical food? “But he answered and said, It is written, Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God.” —Matthew 4:4 “Neither have I gone back from the commandment of his lips; I have esteemed the words of his mouth more than my necessary food.” —Job 23:12 “Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that believeth on me hath everlasting life. I am that bread of life. Your fathers did eat manna in the wilderness, and are dead. This is the bread which cometh down from heaven, that a man may eat thereof, and not die. I am the living bread which came down from heaven: if any man eat of this bread, he shall live for ever: and the bread that I will give is my flesh, which I will give for the life of the world.” —John 6:47-51 Jesus is the spiritual bread that brings everlasting life, and we “eat” it whenever we read His Word. Our need for Him is actually greater than our need for physical food. Who did Jesus say will help me understand the Bible? “Howbeit when he, the Spirit of truth, is come, he will guide you into all truth: for he shall not speak of himself; but whatsoever he shall hear, that shall he speak: and he will shew you things to come.” —John 16:13 Why should I ask for the Holy Spirit’s guidance? “Which things also we speak, not in the words which man’s wisdom teacheth, but which the Holy Ghost teacheth; comparing spiritual things with spiritual. But the natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God: for they are foolishness unto him: neither can he know them, because they are spiritually discerned.” —1 Corinthians 2:13-14 Because spiritual things are spiritually discerned and because the Bible is full of stories with symbolism, I need the Holy Spirit to open my spiritual eyes and help me bring these stories to life. Humility and a teachable attitude is also a crucial part of it. How should I study the Bible? “Whom shall he teach knowledge? and whom shall he make to understand doctrine? them that are weaned from the milk, and drawn from the breasts. For precept must be upon precept, precept upon precept; line upon line, line upon line; here a little, and there a little.” —Isaiah 28:9-10 God is not a God of contradiction or confusion, so it’s important to not take verses out of context and build a doctrine based on a verse or two. When studying a particular topic, it’s critical to identify as many verses as possible dealing with the topic and to let the Bible clarify itself on what seem, due to our misunderstanding, like contradictory ones. What will the truth in God’s Word do to me? “Sanctify them through thy truth: thy word is truth.” —John 17:17 “But we all, with open face beholding as in a glass the glory of the LORD, are changed into the same image from glory to glory, even as by the Spirit of the LORD.” —2 Corinthians 3:18 “For the word of God is living and powerful, and sharper than any two-edged sword, piercing even to the division of soul and spirit, and of joints and marrow, and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart.” —Hebrews 4:12, NKJV Reading the Bible brings me into contact with God’s divine mind and holy character, and by beholding it daily, I become more like Him through the work of the Holy Spirit. There is a reason the book of Hebrews calls the word of God living and powerful! If I’m willing to follow God’s will, what promise do I have? “If anyone wills to do His will, he shall know concerning the doctrine, whether it is from God or whether I speak on My own authority.” —John 7:17, NKJV If I’m willing to follow it, the promise is God will reveal His truth to me.\"},\"2\":{\"title\":\"God’s Law Changed\",\"url\":\"/basics/change/\",\"category\":\"Basics\",\"description\":\"The Bible prophesied a power would arise that would attempt to change God’s law.

Apart from the small number who were able to see and hear it embodied in Jesus, truth is preserved for the rest of us in the Old and New Testaments. It may seem unfair, but we must remember that the majority rejected Him, not realizing that He was indeed the Messiah, the Son of God. Let us also remember the words of Jesus Himself to the unbelieving Thomas: “Because thou hast seen me, thou hast believed; blessed are they that have not seen, and yet have believed” (John 20:29). What else can we learn about truth? “Ho, every one that thirsteth, come ye to the waters, and he that hath no money; come ye, buy, and eat; yea, come, buy wine and milk without money and without price. Wherefore do ye spend money for that which is not bread? and your labour for that which satisfieth not? hearken diligently unto me, and eat ye that which is good, and let your soul delight itself in fatness. Incline your ear, and come unto me: hear, and your soul shall live; and I will make an everlasting covenant with you, even the sure mercies of David.” —Isaiah 55:1-3 “Buy the truth, and sell it not; also wisdom, and instruction, and understanding.” —Proverbs 23:23 “Again, the kingdom of heaven is like unto a merchant man, seeking goodly pearls: who, when he had found one pearl of great price, went and sold all that he had, and bought it.” —Matthew 13:45 Truth is a free gift that can be obtained “without money and without price” by the poorest and the richest; yet, because we live in a world where good and evil are at war, error and deception strive for supremacy over truth. Due to Satan’s incessant warfare against it, truth often brings reproach, inconvenience, and sacrifice into the lives of those who, having found it in God’s Word, consider it better than gold and sweeter than honey. Some are willing to sacrifice everything for it, while personal gain, convenience, or persecution causes others to abandon it. Does Jesus change? “Jesus Christ the same yesterday, and to day, and for ever.” —Hebrews 13:8 What were the Ten Commandments written on? “And he gave unto Moses, when he had made an end of communing with him upon mount Sinai, two tables of testimony, tables of stone, written with the finger of God.” —Exodus 31:18 God wrote the Ten Commandments Himself on tablets of stone to demonstrate their unchanging and eternal nature. What did Jesus declare about the law? “Think not that I am come to destroy the law, or the prophets: I am not come to destroy, but to fulfil. For verily I say unto you, till heaven and earth pass, one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law, till all be fulfilled.” —Matthew 5:17-18 “And it is easier for heaven and earth to pass, than one tittle of the law to fail.” —Luke 16:17 “My covenant will I not break, nor alter the thing that is gone out of my lips.” —Psalm 89:34 “For I am the LORD, I change not; therefore ye sons of Jacob are not consumed.” —Malachi 3:6 Since Jesus cannot change, His law cannot change either, for it reflects His holy and unchanging character. Consequently, God could not alter His holy law and still remain the infinitely holy God that He is. Moreover, if His law could have been modified, the Father would have never needed to send His Son to die for our sins on Calvary. Christ’s death stands as eternal testimony that the law is as immutable as God Himself. It is often claimed that because of Jesus’ death, we are no longer under the law but under grace. But which of the Ten Commandments do we no longer need? Since Jesus died for our sins, are we now free to have other gods, bow down to images, blaspheme God’s name, desecrate His Sabbath, dishonor our parents, murder, commit adultery, steal, lie, and covet? Of course not. Each of these commandments remains as relevant today as when they were first proclaimed on Mount Sinai. What is part of His law? When was it established? “Remember the sabbath day, to keep it holy. Six days shalt thou labour, and do all thy work: but the seventh day is the sabbath of the LORD thy God: in it thou shalt not do any work, thou, nor thy son, nor thy daughter, thy manservant, nor thy maidservant, nor thy cattle, nor thy stranger that is within thy gates: for in six days the LORD made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that in them is, and rested the seventh day: wherefore the LORD blessed the sabbath day, and hallowed it.” —Exodus 20:8-11 “Thus the heavens and the earth were finished, and all the host of them. And on the seventh day God ended his work which he had made; and he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had made. And God blessed the seventh day, and sanctified it: because that in it he had rested from all his work which God created and made.” —Genesis 2:1-3 Part of the Ten Commandments that God gave to Moses on Mount Sinai is the seventh-day Sabbath, although God sanctified the day in the very first week of creation. The fourth commandment is a monument in time—a weekly reminder of our Creator God and an opportunity to acknowledge Him as Lord of our lives. The beauty of a time-based monument is its universal accessibility to all, regardless of location, who choose to receive its blessing of rest in God. Did Jesus keep it? “And he came to Nazareth, where he had been brought up: and, as his custom was, he went into the synagogue on the sabbath day, and stood up for to read.” —Luke 4:16 “And it came to pass also on another sabbath, that he entered into the synagogue and taught: and there was a man whose right hand was withered.” —Luke 6:6 “And they went into Capernaum; and straightway on the sabbath day he entered into the synagogue, and taught.” —Mark 1:21 Was it kept after His ascension? “But when they departed from Perga, they came to Antioch in Pisidia, and went into the synagogue on the sabbath day, and sat down.” —Acts 13:14 “And when the Jews were gone out of the synagogue, the Gentiles besought that these words might be preached to them the next sabbath. Now when the congregation was broken up, many of the Jews and religious proselytes followed Paul and Barnabas: who, speaking to them, persuaded them to continue in the grace of God. And the next sabbath day came almost the whole city together to hear the word of God.” —Acts 13:42-44 “And from thence to Philippi, which is the chief city of that part of Macedonia, and a colony: and we were in that city abiding certain days. And on the sabbath we went out of the city by a river side, where prayer was wont to be made; and we sat down, and spake unto the women which resorted thither.” —Acts 16:12-13 “After these things Paul departed from Athens, and came to Corinth; … And he reasoned in the synagogue every sabbath, and persuaded the Jews and the Greeks.” —Acts 18:1,4 In the Bible, the weekly Sabbath refers to the seventh day of the week (Exodus 20:10). Scripture testifies that Jesus Himself kept it, and His apostles continued to keep it after His ascension. What warning did Paul give? “Take heed therefore unto yourselves, and to all the flock, over the which the Holy Ghost hath made you overseers, to feed the church of God, which he hath purchased with his own blood. For I know this, that after my departing shall grievous wolves enter in among you, not sparing the flock. Also of your own selves shall men arise, speaking perverse things, to draw away disciples after them. Therefore watch, and remember, that by the space of three years I ceased not to warn every one night and day with tears.” —Acts 20:28-31 Paul warned that people would arise within the church—professing to be Christians—who would speak perverse things to draw believers away from the truth. Was this prophesied in advance? “And out of one of them came forth a little horn, which waxed exceeding great, toward the south, and toward the east, and toward the pleasant land. And it waxed great, even to the host of heaven; and it cast down some of the host and of the stars to the ground, and stamped upon them. Yea, he magnified himself even to the prince of the host, and by him the daily sacrifice was taken away, and the place of his sanctuary was cast down. And an host was given him against the daily sacrifice by reason of transgression, and it cast down the truth to the ground; and it practised, and prospered.” —Daniel 8:9-12 Daniel prophesied that a power, symbolized by a little horn, would arise and exalt itself in opposition to God’s authority, trampling on the truths of the Bible. Does Daniel have additional details? “And the ten horns out of this kingdom are ten kings that shall arise: and another shall rise after them; and he shall be diverse from the first, and he shall subdue three kings. And he shall speak great words against the most High, and shall wear out the saints of the most High, and think to change times and laws: and they shall be given into his hand until a time and times and the dividing of time.” —Daniel 7:24-25 These verses echo Paul’s warning about men arising “speaking perverse things,” as it describes a religious power that would “speak great words against the most High.” This power, again symbolized by a horn, would challenge God’s authority, persecute His followers for 1,260 years, and seek to change times and laws. This is the same religious power as the one described in Daniel 8:9-12, except that in Daniel 7:24-25 it rises from among the ten tribes that divided the Roman Empire, whereas in Daniel 8 it arises out of one of the four Greek kingdoms that emerged after the death of Alexander the Great. Since the Roman religion of Mithraism was borrowed from Greece through the Kingdom of Pergamon, it is not contradictory to say that this power emerged from both the Greek and Roman Empires. In fact, Mithraism was the Persian name for Babylonian sun worship, for Mithra was the Persian god of light, who, under the Roman Empire, was identified with the sun god Sol Invictus, the invincible or unconquerable sun. This sun worship was later Christianized when Catholicism declared Sunday holy in honor of Christ’s resurrection—a day long associated with pagan sun worship, not only in Mithraism but also in the religion of ancient Babylon. Thus, there is a direct line of continuity between the religions of Babylon, Persia, Greece, Rome, and Catholicism—a progression symbolically illustrated in the image of Daniel 2. There is only one commandment that is both a law and a measure of time: the fourth. The first seeds of its alteration were planted when Constantine converted to Christianity in 312 AD, for after becoming Emperor, he granted Christian bishops influence in the legislative process. Under their guidance, he soon passed the first Sunday law in 321 AD, declaring Sunday—the pagan day of sun worship—the official day of rest across the Roman Empire. This was reinforced in 364 AD, when the Council of Laodicea urged Christians to observe Sunday as their rest day while prohibiting them from resting on Saturday. Thus, the fourth commandment of God was effectively changed—from honoring the biblical seventh-day Sabbath established at creation to observing Sunday—and the rest is history. Murl Vance, “The Counterfeit Memorial,” Signs of the Times, July 29, 1940, p. 4 The term “times” in “think to change times and laws” also applies to prophetic times—the method of prophetic interpretation in particular. The historicist method, championed by the Protestant Reformers, has largely been abandoned in favor of the preterist and futurist methods, introduced by the Roman Catholic Jesuits Luis de Alcazar and Francisco Ribera. Alcazar proposed that the prophecies of Daniel and Revelation were fulfilled in the past (preterism), while Ribera suggested they will be fulfilled in the future (futurism). Historicism, on the other hand, views prophecy as relevant throughout church history, tracing it to specific historical events, nations, and movements. The preterist and futurist methods were introduced mainly to counter the historicist method and to divert attention away from Catholicism as a major power in end-time prophetic scenarios, since historicism unequivocally identifies the Roman Catholic Church as the sea beast of Revelation 13. Did Jesus warn about this? “Thus have ye made the commandment of God of none effect by your tradition. Ye hypocrites, well did Esaias prophesy of you, saying, This people draweth nigh unto me with their mouth, and honoureth me with their lips; but their heart is far from me. But in vain they do worship me, teaching for doctrines the commandments of men.” —Matthew 15:6-9 The elevation of human-made commandments and traditions above the truth of the Bible was already a problem in Jesus’ time, and He warned against it. Why? Because it is idolatry. Idolatry is traditionally defined as the worship of idols—human-made images. In the same way, Sunday sacredness is a human-made tradition. Just as God did not create the sun as an object of worship, He did not establish the first day as a day of worship; therefore, there is no real difference between worshiping the object and venerating the day. He also did not rest on Sunday. The Sabbath commemorates God’s rest on the seventh day, so Sunday cannot be the “new” Sabbath for the simple reason that He did not rest on that day. We never celebrate a friend’s birthday or a couple’s wedding anniversary on the day it did not occur, because these dates are historical, not arbitrary. Just as we cannot change the day we were born or married, we cannot change the day on which God rested. The same principle applies to Christmas—the supposed birth of Christ on December 25. It is highly unlikely that He was born at that time, since shepherds would not have been out in the fields watching their sheep in the middle of winter. Like Sunday, the date was associated with the sun in paganism. Its placement shortly after the winter solstice—the shortest day of the year—is a significant clue that it originally celebrated the sun’s “rebirth,” as the days slowly began to grow longer. What else was changed besides the fourth commandment? “And he shall speak great words against the most High, and shall wear out the saints of the most High, and think to change times and laws: and they shall be given into his hand until a time and times and the dividing of time.” —Daniel 7:25 The word “laws” is plural, and indeed the Sabbath commandment was not the only one that was changed. The Catholic Church removed the second commandment, which prohibits the worship of images, and divided the tenth commandment into two. However, it is the alteration of the fourth commandment that stands out most, because the Sabbath is the mark of God’s authority, identifying Him as the Creator. To alter it, therefore, is to directly challenge God’s authority. This naturally raises the following question: What is the Catholic Church’s mark of authority? Incidentally, Catholicism teaches that the pope is infallible when he speaks ex cathedra—from his authoritative position—yet at the same time asserts that God, the Creator of all, could somehow alter His own divine law. How can this be? What is the Catholic Church’s mark of authority? “Now in the matter of Sabbath observance the Protestant rule of Faith is utterly unable to explain the substitution of the Christian Sunday for the Jewish Saturday. It has been changed. The Bible still teaches that the Sabbath or Saturday should be kept holy. There is no authority in the New Testament for the substitution of Sunday for Saturday. Surely it is an important matter. It stands there in the Bible as one of the Ten Commandments of God. There is no authority in the Bible for abrogating this Commandment, or for transferring its observance to another day of the week. … ““We have in the authoritative voice of the Church the voice of Christ Himself. The Church is above the Bible; and this transference of Sabbath observance from Saturday to Sunday is proof positive of that fact. Deny the authority of the Church and you have no adequate or reasonable explanation or justification for the substitution of Sunday for Saturday in the Third—Protestant Fourth—Commandment of God.” —\\\"Sabbath Observance,\\\" The Catholic Record, September 1, 1923, p. 4. “Of course the Catholic Church claims that the change was her act. It could not have been otherwise, as none in those days would have dreamed of doing anything, in matters spiritual, ecclesiastical and religious without her. This act is a mark of her ecclesiastical power and authority in religious matters.” —C. F. Thomas, Chancellor of Cardinal Gibbons, letter, October 28, 1895. “The Church changed the observance of the Sabbath to Sunday by right of the divine, infallible authority given to her by her founder, Jesus Christ. The Protestant, claiming the Bible to be the only guide of faith, has no warrant for observing Sunday. In this matter the Seventh-day Adventist is the only consistent Protestant.” —The Catholic Universe Bulletin, August 14, 1942, p. 4. “If Protestants would follow the Bible, they would worship God on the Sabbath Day. In keeping the Sunday they are following a law of the Catholic Church.” —Albert Smith, Chancellor of Cardinal Gibbons, letter, February 10, 1920. “My brethren, look about you upon the various wrangling sects and denominations. Show me one that claims, or possesses the power to make laws binding on the conscience. There’s but one on the face of the earth—the Catholic Church—that has the power to make laws binding upon the conscience, binding before God, binding under pain of hell fire. Take for instance the day we celebrate—Sunday. What right have the Protestant churches to observe that, day? None whatever. … Sunday is not the Sabbath according to the Bible and the record of time. Every one knows that Sunday is the first day of the week, while Saturday is the seventh day and the Sabbath, the day consecrated as a day of rest. It is so recognized in all civilized nations. ““I have repeatedly offered $1000 to any one who will furnish any proof from the Bible that Sunday is the day we are bound to keep, and no one has called for the money. If any person in this town will show me any scripture for it I will, tomorrow evening, publicly acknowledge it and thank him for it. It was the holy Catholic Church that changed the day of rest from Saturday to Sunday, the first day of the week. And it not only compelled all to keep Sunday, but at the Council of Laodicea, A. D. 364, anathematized those who kept the Sabbath and urged all persons to labor on the seventh day under the penalty of anathema. ““Which church does the whole civilized world obey? Protestants … profess great reverence for the Bible, and yet by their solemn act of keeping Sunday they acknowledge the power of the Catholic Church. The Bible says, ‘Remember the Sabbath day, to keep it holy,’ but the Catholic Church says, ‘No, keep the first day of the week,’ and the whole world bows in obedience.” —Catholic Priest T. Enright, lecture at Harlan, Iowa, December 15, 1889. What question does the papacy ask Protestants? “Protestants have repeatedly asked the papacy, “How could you dare to change God’s law?” But the question posed to Protestants by the Catholic church is even more penetrating. ““Here it is officially: You will tell me that Saturday was the Jewish Sabbath, but that the Christian Sabbath has been changed to Sunday. Changed! but by whom? Who has authority to change an express commandment of Almighty God? When God has spoken and said, Thou shalt keep holy the seventh day, who shall dare to say, Nay, thou mayest work and do all manner of worldly business on the seventh day; but thou shalt keep holy the first day in its stead? ““This is a most important question, which I know not how you can answer. You are a Protestant, and you profess to go by the Bible and the Bible only; and yet in so important a matter as the observance of one day in seven as a holy day, you go against the plain letter of the Bible, and put another day in the place of that day which the Bible has commanded. ““The command to keep holy the seventh day is one of the ten commandments; you believe that the other nine are still binding; who gave you authority to tamper with the fourth? If you are consistent with your own principles, if you really follow the Bible and the Bible only, you ought to be able to produce some portion of the New Testament in which this fourth commandment is expressly altered. {% ct \\\"Library of Christian Doctrine: Why Don't You Keep Holy the Sabbath-Day? (London: Burns and Oates, Ltd.), pp. 3, 4.\\\" %} How many lawgivers are there? “There is one lawgiver, who is able to save and to destroy: who art thou that judgest another?” —James 4:12 There is only one Lawgiver—God. Yet we have learned that there exists a religious power claiming to be a lawgiver as well, one that considers itself justified in altering the law of God Himself, thereby placing its authority above His (2 Thessalonians 2:3-4). Jesus warned, “And fear not them which kill the body, but are not able to kill the soul: but rather fear him [God] which is able to destroy both soul and body in hell” (Matthew 10:28). The Church can kill the body (as it did to millions during the Dark Ages), but God has power to raise it from the dead (1 Thessalonians 4:16; 1 Corinthians 15:52). Whom, then, would you rather obey? “Reason and sense demand the acceptance of one or the other of these alternatives: either Protestantism and the keeping holy of Saturday, or Catholicity and the keeping holy of Sunday. Compromise is impossible.” —John Cardinal Gibbons, The Catholic Mirror, December 23, 1893. What role will the law play in the last days? “And after these things I saw four angels standing on the four corners of the earth, holding the four winds of the earth, that the wind should not blow on the earth, nor on the sea, nor on any tree. And I saw another angel ascending from the east, having the seal of the living God: and he cried with a loud voice to the four angels, to whom it was given to hurt the earth and the sea, saying, Hurt not the earth, neither the sea, nor the trees, till we have sealed the servants of our God in their foreheads.” —Revelation 7:1-3 “Bind up the testimony, seal the law among my disciples.” —Isaiah 8:16 “Nevertheless the foundation of God standeth sure, having this seal, The Lord knoweth them that are his. And, Let every one that nameth the name of Christ depart from iniquity.” —2 Timothy 2:19 In the last days, there will be a sealing of God’s people in their foreheads, which, according to Isaiah and 2 Timothy, refers to God’s law, for sin (iniquity) is the transgression of His law (1 John 3:4). When God’s people are sealed, they make an unwavering decision to honor the authority of His law as supreme—above the laws of men—no matter the cost. Their hearts are so knit with their Father’s that they would rather die than disobey their Maker (Revelation 12:11). This is not a works-based, legalistic religion, but a love-driven loyalty—by His grace through faith—to the One who risked all to save us. It is a faith that works. To the truly converted person who has been born again, keeping God’s law is not a burden but a delight (1 John 5:3; Psalm 40:8). It is noteworthy that in the Bible, God’s Ten Commandments are linked with His name (Deuteronomy 28:9-10; Revelation 14:1, 12) because they reflect His character. Therefore, God’s servants being sealed in their foreheads is synonymous with His name being written there (Revelation 14:1; 22:4). The harlot who rides the beast in Revelation 17:5 also bears a name on her forehead that stands in direct contrast to God’s holy name: “MYSTERY, BABYLON THE GREAT, THE MOTHER OF HARLOTS AND ABOMINATIONS OF THE EARTH”. Why is the name written on the forehead? Paul explains in Philippians 2:5, “Let this mind be in you, which was also in Christ Jesus.” To be sealed with His name is to possess His mind—a mind that delights to do the Father’s will, as revealed in His law (John 8:29). This is accomplished only by faith in God’s promises (Jeremiah 31:33; Ephesians 2:8) and through the transforming power of the Holy Spirit working in us (Titus 3:5). Those who are sealed with His name are clothed with the righteousness of Christ, symbolized in Revelation by the white robe washed in the blood of the Lamb and freely offered to all (Revelation 7:9, 14; 3:18). Jesus asks each of us, “Wilt thou be made whole?” (John 5:6). Do we have the faith of the leper who said to Him, “Lord, if thou wilt, thou canst make me clean” (Matthew 8:2)? If we do, Jesus will cleanse us—immediately—from the guilt, shame, and defilement of sin. “And Jesus put forth his hand, and touched him, saying, I will; be thou clean. And immediately his leprosy was cleansed.” —Matthew 8:3 If our faith is lacking, we can exercise the faith we do have as we ask for more: “Lord, I believe; help thou mine unbelief” (Mark 9:24). What is said about the saints? “Saying with a loud voice, Fear God, and give glory to him; for the hour of his judgment is come: and worship him that made heaven, and earth, and the sea, and the fountains of waters. … Here is the patience of the saints: here are they that keep the commandments of God, and the faith of Jesus.” —Revelation 14:7, 12 The final invitation in the last days to worship God includes a reference to the latter part of the fourth commandment, which identifies the Sabbath as the sign that God is the Creator of all. Those who respond to this call will be sealed with His law, of which the seventh-day Sabbath is the distinguishing sign. The call to worship God implies that another power will also seek worship, bearing its own counterfeit seal—the altered Ten Commandments—of which Sunday will be the mark. Just as God used the eating of a tree to test Adam and Eve in Eden, so He will use the observance of a day to test the final generation living on earth. Revelation 14:12 leaves no room for doubt, declaring that the saints will, by God’s grace, keep His commandments and the faith of Jesus.\",\"series\":\"The Counterfeit Sabbath\"},\"3\":{\"title\":\"Is There Life After Death?\",\"url\":\"/basics/death/\",\"category\":\"Basics\",\"description\":\"It started with a lie in the Garden of Eden, and it’s still being told today.

Then said his disciples, Lord, if he sleep, he shall do well. Howbeit Jesus spake of his death: but they thought that he had spoken of taking of rest in sleep. Then said Jesus unto them plainly, Lazarus is dead.” —John 11:11-14 Will there be a resurrection? “For this we say unto you by the word of the Lord, that we which are alive and remain unto the coming of the Lord shall not prevent them which are asleep. For the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the archangel, and with the trump of God: and the dead in Christ shall rise first.” —1 Thessalonians 4:15-16 “I am he that liveth, and was dead; and, behold, I am alive for evermore, amen; and have the keys of hell and of death.” —Revelation 1:18 Jesus uses the state of sleep as a metaphor for death because He knows there will be a resurrection at the second coming. This will be a resurrection of those who died in Christ because He was the only One who conquered death. Will there be a second resurrection? “Marvel not at this: for the hour is coming, in the which all that are in the graves shall hear his voice, and shall come forth; they that have done good, unto the resurrection of life; and they that have done evil, unto the resurrection of damnation.” —John 5:28-29 John makes it clear there will be two resurrections for two different groups of people: those who, through the grace of Christ, reflected goodness in their life will be part of the resurrection of life, which takes place at the second coming of Jesus, while those who lived unrighteous lives will be part of the resurrection of damnation. How did God form the first human? “And the LORD God formed man of the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soul.” —Genesis 2:7 God made man by forming him from the dust of the ground and breathing into him the breath of life. In other words, dust (the body) plus breath of God equals a living soul. What happens when a person dies? “Then shall the dust return to the earth as it was: and the spirit shall return unto God who gave it.” —Ecclesiastes 12:7 When a person dies, the body returns to dust, and the spirit returns to God. What is the spirit that returns to God? “All the while my breath is in me, and the spirit of God is in my nostrils.” —Job 27:3 “For as the body without the spirit is dead, so faith without works is dead also.” —James 2:26 The spirit that returns to God is simply the breath of life, without which the body dies. In other words, the process described in Ecclesiastes 12:7 is the opposite of what happened in Genesis 2:7. If a soul is a combination of two things—the body and the breath of life (spirit)—then the soul ceases to exist when the body returns to dust and the breath returns to God. The soul does not go anywhere; it simply ceases to exist. As an illustration, consider what is needed for light: there needs to be an electrical current and a bulb. As soon as the electrical current is turned off, the light simply ceases to exist. It is the same with the soul. What else does the Bible about the soul? “Behold, all souls are mine; as the soul of the father, so also the soul of the son is mine: the soul that sinneth, it shall die.” —Ezekiel 18:4 “For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.” —Romans 6:23 “For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God.” —Romans 3:23 A person’s soul or spirit does not go to heaven or hell at death, for the Bible plainly declares, “The soul that sinneth, it shall die.” Why is this so? Because the wages of sin are death, and all have sinned. Moreover, before His ascension, Jesus assured His disciples, “I will come again, and receive you unto Myself” (John 14:2-3). Notice that He did not say they would come to Him at death, but rather that He would come to them at His Second Coming. Where is King David now? “Men and brethren, let me freely speak unto you of the patriarch David, that he is both dead and buried, and his sepulchre is with us unto this day. … For David is not ascended into the heavens: but he saith himself, The LORD said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand.” —Acts 2:29, 34 Is conscious thought possible after death? “Put not your trust in princes, nor in the son of man, in whom there is no help. His breath goeth forth, he returneth to his earth; in that very day his thoughts perish.” —Psalm 146:3-4 Since the spirit is simply the breath then it is not possible for the spirit to exist after death. Here the psalmist describes the same process of death that was described in the previous verses: the breath leaving the body and returning to God who gave it, the body returning to dust (the earth), and when these two things happen all conscious thought ceases to exist. Can the dead praise God? “The dead praise not the LORD, neither any that go down into silence.” —Psalm 115:17 Do dead people remember anything? “For in death there is no remembrance of thee: in the grave who shall give thee thanks?” —Psalm 6:5 “For the living know that they shall die: but the dead know not any thing, neither have they any more a reward; for the memory of them is forgotten. Also their love, and their hatred, and their envy, is now perished; neither have they any more a portion for ever in any thing that is done under the sun.” —Ecclesiastes 9:5-6 Who has immortality? “That thou keep this commandment without spot, unrebukeable, until the appearing of our Lord Jesus Christ: which in his times he shall shew, who is the blessed and only Potentate, the King of kings, and Lord of lords; who only hath immortality, dwelling in the light which no man can approach unto; whom no man hath seen, nor can see: to whom be honour and power everlasting.” —1 Timothy 6:14-16 “Shall mortal man be more just than God? shall a man be more pure than his maker?” —Job 4:17 Man is fully mortal; only God is immortal. This idea that the soul is immortal stems from the Garden of Eden where Satan told Eve she would surely not die (Genesis 3:4), even though God clearly said that sin brings death (Genesis 2:17). Who else will inherit immortality? “To them who by patient continuance in well doing seek for glory and honour and immortality, eternal life.” —Romans 2:7 “For the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the archangel, and with the trump of God: and the dead in Christ shall rise first: then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air: and so shall we ever be with the Lord.” —1 Thessalonians 4:16-17 “Behold, I shew you a mystery; we shall not all sleep, but we shall all be changed, in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trump: for the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed. For this corruptible must put on incorruption, and this mortal must put on immortality. So when this corruptible shall have put on incorruption, and this mortal shall have put on immortality, then shall be brought to pass the saying that is written, Death is swallowed up in victory.” —1 Corinthians 15:51-54 1 Corinthians 15 says that not all the righteous will experience death, but all the righteous will be changed when the trumpet of God sounds at the second coming. In other words, the righteous who are live to see the second coming, as well as those who died in Christ, who will at that moment be resurrected, will receive new, immortal bodies. From that point on death will never have power over them because Jesus defeated it, and by accepting His sacrifice on their behalf, they will inherit His victory over it! What hope did Job have about the resurrection? “For I know that my redeemer liveth, and that he shall stand at the latter day upon the earth: and though after my skin worms destroy this body, yet in my flesh shall I see God.” —Job 19:25-26 “Who shall change our vile body, that it may be fashioned like unto his glorious body, according to the working whereby he is able even to subdue all things unto himself.” —Philippians 3:21 Because Jesus, His Redeemer, conquered death, Job will one day be able to see Him in a glorious, new, physical body. What about Luke 23:43? “And Jesus said unto him, Verily I say unto thee, today shalt thou be with me in paradise.” —Luke 23:43 “Jesus saith unto her, Touch me not; for I am not yet ascended to my Father: but go to my brethren, and say unto them, I ascend unto my Father, and your Father; and to my God, and your God.” —John 20:17 Jesus could not have gone to heaven after His death because on Sunday morning He told Mary He hadn’t yet ascended to His Father. It’s a little know fact, but the original Bible text did not have any punctuation. It was added centuries later by translators who could have placed the comma before the word “today” due to their own beliefs about death. The better place for the comma would be after the word “today” because then it would be in harmony with all the other Bible texts regarding death. Jesus was promising the thief on the cross that day—when it did not look like He could save anyone—that he would be with Him in Paradise one day when He returns to take all of His children home to heaven. Who did Saul see in Endor then? “And the king said unto her, Be not afraid: for what sawest thou? And the woman said unto Saul, I saw gods ascending out of the earth. And he said unto her, What form is he of? And she said, An old man cometh up; and he is covered with a mantle. And Saul perceived that it was Samuel, and he stooped with his face to the ground, and bowed himself.” —1 Samuel 28:13-14 “As the cloud is consumed and vanisheth away: so he that goeth down to the grave shall come up no more. He shall return no more to his house, neither shall his place know him any more.” —Job 7:9-10 “And there came forth a spirit, and stood before the LORD, and said, I will persuade him. And the LORD said unto him, Wherewith? And he said, I will go forth, and I will be a lying spirit in the mouth of all his prophets. And he said, Thou shalt persuade him, and prevail also: go forth, and do so.” —1 Kings 22:21-22 “For they are the spirits of devils, working miracles, which go forth unto the kings of the earth and of the whole world, to gather them to the battle of that great day of God Almighty.” —Revelation 16:14 It could not have been Samuel that Saul saw because the Bible is clear that the dead remain dead until the resurrection. In Revelation we learn that the devil has fallen angels whom he was able to persuade to join his rebellion in heaven, and after he was cast to earth, they were cast down with him (Revelation 12:4). In other places, they are called “lying spirits” and “spirits of devils” who have the power to work miracles, including masquerading as human beings. In fact, Satan Himself is able to appear as an angel of light (2 Corinthians 11:14). Saul saw one of these spirits masquerading as Samuel. What does the Bible say about communication with spirits? “Do not turn to mediums or spiritists; do not seek them out to be defiled by them. I am the LORD your God.” —Leviticus 19:31, NASB “There shall not be found among you any one that maketh his son or his daughter to pass through the fire, or that useth divination, or an observer of times, or an enchanter, or a witch, or a charmer, or a consulter with familiar spirits, or a wizard, or a necromancer. For all that do these things are an abomination unto the LORD: and because of these abominations the LORD thy God doth drive them out from before thee.” —Deuteronomy 18:10-12 “Now the Spirit speaketh expressly, that in the latter times some shall depart from the faith, giving heed to seducing spirits, and doctrines of devils.” —1 Timothy 4:1 “And when they say to you, “Seek those who are mediums and wizards, who whisper and mutter,” should not a people seek their God? Should they seek the dead on behalf of the living? To the law and to the testimony! If they do not speak according to this word, it is because there is no light in them.” —Isaiah 8:19-20, NKJV Communication with spirits is forbidden in the Bible because it’s an abomination to God. Paul also warns that this practice is one of the signs of the last days, and it will lead to deception and a departure from the faith, meaning it will be practiced by those who claim to be believers. Isaiah says that the only way to identify whether a spirit is from God or not is to compare what it says with the Word of God because every lying spirit will speak contrary to His Word. What did Paul write at the end of his life? “I have fought a good fight, I have finished my course, I have kept the faith: henceforth there is laid up for me a crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous judge, shall give me at that day: and not to me only, but unto all them also that love his appearing.” —2 Timothy 4:7-8 May the grace of Jesus help us to live a life of unwavering commitment and faithfulness to Him.\",\"series\":\"Mainstream Deceptions\"},\"4\":{\"title\":\"Divinity of Christ\",\"url\":\"/basics/divinity/\",\"category\":\"Basics\",\"description\":\"Is Jesus God, or was He just a prophet?

What does it mean? “Behold, a virgin shall be with child, and shall bring forth a son, and they shall call his name Emmanuel, which being interpreted is, God with us.” —Matthew 1:23 Does John confirm Jesus’ divinity? “In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. &hellip; And the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us, and we beheld his glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father, full of grace and truth.” —John 1:1, 14 What did Jesus say about His divinity? “And now, O Father, glorify thou me with thine own self with the glory which I had with thee before the world was. … Father, I will that they also, whom thou hast given me, be with me where I am; that they may behold my glory, which thou hast given me: for thou lovedst me before the foundation of the world.” —John 17:5, 24 The Father shares His glory with His Son, Jesus, and it has always been this way. What other claim did Jesus make? “Jesus said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Before Abraham was, I am.” —John 8:58 Why is this claim significant? “And God said unto Moses, “I AM THAT I AM”: and he said, “Thus shalt thou say unto the children of Israel, ‘I AM hath sent me unto you.’”” —Exodus 3:14 Jesus used this expression to reveal Himself to Moses as “the Self-existing One.” It mirrors another of God’s names, Yahweh, which comes from a Hebrew word meaning “to be” or “to exist.” He’s telling Moses that He has no beginning or end. Does Paul corroborate this? “For by him were all things created, that are in heaven, and that are in earth, visible and invisible, whether they be thrones, or dominions, or principalities, or powers: all things were created by him, and for him: and he is before all things, and by him all things consist.” —Colossians 1:16-17 Not only is Jesus the Self-existing One, but He is also the Creator of all things! What is another sign of Jesus’ divinity? “And when he saw their faith, he said unto him, Man, thy sins are forgiven thee. And the scribes and the Pharisees began to reason, saying, Who is this which speaketh blasphemies? Who can forgive sins, but God alone? But when Jesus perceived their thoughts, he answering said unto them, What reason ye in your hearts? Whether is easier, to say, Thy sins be forgiven thee; or to say, Rise up and walk? But that ye may know that the Son of man hath power upon earth to forgive sins, (he said unto the sick of the palsy,) I say unto thee, Arise, and take up thy couch, and go into thine house.” —Luke 5:20-24 Because He is God, Jesus has the power to forgive sins. What did Thomas call Jesus? “And Thomas answered and said unto him, My Lord and my God.” —John 20:28 Do the angels worship Jesus? What does the Father call Him? “For unto which of the angels said he at any time, “Thou art my Son, this day have I begotten thee?” And again, “I will be to him a Father, and he shall be to me a Son?” And again, when he bringeth in the firstbegotten into the world, he saith, “And let all the angels of God worship him.” And of the angels he saith, “Who maketh his angels spirits, and his ministers a flame of fire.” But unto the Son he saith, “Thy throne, O God, is for ever and ever: a sceptre of righteousness is the sceptre of thy kingdom. Thou hast loved righteousness, and hated iniquity; therefore God, even thy God, hath anointed thee with the oil of gladness above thy fellows.”” —Hebrews 1:5-9 Not only do the angels in heaven worship Jesus, but the Father Himself calls Him God. What is one of the names given to Jesus in Isaiah 9? “For unto us a child is born, unto us a son is given: and the government shall be upon his shoulder: and his name shall be called Wonderful, Counseller, The mighty God, The everlasting Father, The Prince of Peace.” —Isaiah 9:6 What does Micah say about Jesus? “But thou, Bethlehem Ephratah, though thou be little among the thousands of Judah, yet out of thee shall he come forth unto me that is to be ruler in Israel; whose goings forth have been from of old, from everlasting.” —Micah 5:2 This Messianic prophecy is another echo of Jesus being “the Self-existing One.” Does Paul affirm Jesus’ divinity? “For in him dwelleth all the fulness of the Godhead bodily.” —Colossians 2:9 “Which in his times he shall shew, who is the blessed and only Potentate, the King of kings, and Lord of lords; who only hath immortality, dwelling in the light which no man can approach unto; whom no man hath seen, nor can see: to whom be honour and power everlasting.” —1 Timothy 6:15-16 Jesus “dwelling in unapproachable light” is a reference to His divinity, glory, and holiness, which no man can see and live. What claim does Jesus make in Revelation? “I am he that liveth, and was dead; and, behold, I am alive for evermore, amen; and have the keys of hell and of death.” —Revelation 1:18 Death could not conquer Jesus because it has no power over Him who is God. Does Paul have anything else to say about Jesus? “Let this mind be in you, which was also in Christ Jesus: who, being in the form of God, thought it not robbery to be equal with God: but made himself of no reputation, and took upon him the form of a servant, and was made in the likeness of men: and being found in fashion as a man, he humbled himself, and became obedient unto death, even the death of the cross. Wherefore God also hath highly exalted him, and given him a name which is above every name: that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of things in heaven, and things in earth, and things under the earth; and that every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father. Wherefore, my beloved, as ye have always obeyed, not as in my presence only, but now much more in my absence, work out your own salvation with fear and trembling.” —Philippians 2:5-12 Because Jesus is God and is equal with God, the Father, there will come a day when every human being will bow before Him and confess that He is Lord.\",\"series\":\"Jesus, the Messiah\"},\"5\":{\"title\":\"What Will Heaven Be Like?\",\"url\":\"/basics/heaven/\",\"category\":\"Basics\",\"description\":\"Heaven is real, accessible to all, and more glorious than anything we have seen, heard, or imagined.\",\"body\":\"What promise did Jesus make about heaven? “Let not your heart be troubled: ye believe in God, believe also in me. In my Father’s house are many mansions: if it were not so, I would have told you. I go to prepare a place for you. And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again, and receive you unto myself; that where I am, there ye may be also.” —John 14:1-3 After His resurrection, Jesus returned to heaven to prepare it for His children’s arrival, and a day will come when He will return for them in order to bring them to heaven and dwell with Him for all eternity. What insight does Peter give? “But the day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night; in the which the heavens shall pass away with a great noise, and the elements shall melt with fervent heat, the earth also and the works that are therein shall be burned up. Seeing then that all these things shall be dissolved, what manner of persons ought ye to be in all holy conversation and godliness, looking for and hasting unto the coming of the day of God, wherein the heavens being on fire shall be dissolved, and the elements shall melt with fervent heat? Nevertheless we, according to his promise, look for new heavens and a new earth, wherein dwelleth righteousness.” —2 Peter 3:10-13 Unlike life on earth now, heaven will be a place where righteousness dwells. Sin and its consequences will be forever abolished. What kind of people will be there? “Blessed are the poor in spirit: for theirs is the kingdom of heaven. Blessed are they that mourn: for they shall be comforted. Blessed are the meek: for they shall inherit the earth. Blessed are they which do hunger and thirst after righteousness: for they shall be filled. Blessed are the merciful: for they shall obtain mercy. Blessed are the pure in heart: for they shall see God. Blessed are the peacemakers: for they shall be called the children of God. Blessed are they which are persecuted for righteousness’ sake: for theirs is the kingdom of heaven. Blessed are ye, when men shall revile you, and persecute you, and shall say all manner of evil against you falsely, for my sake. Rejoice, and be exceeding glad: for great is your reward in heaven: for so persecuted they the prophets which were before you.” —Matthew 5:3-12 “Jesus answered and said unto him, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God. Nicodemus saith unto him, How can a man be born when he is old? can he enter the second time into his mother’s womb, and be born? Jesus answered, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born of water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God.” —John 3:3 No one is born pure in heart, hungering and thirsting after rigtheousness because all have sinned (Romans 3:23). This is why Jesus said that no one can see the kingdom of God without being born again of the Spirit. So even though all have sinned, some, after learning about the love of Jesus, choose to put an end to the rebellion against Him in their lives. They make peace with Him by reaching out and taking His hand of mercy that offers forgiveness and imparts grace into their lives, restoring them into His image and fitting them for heaven. They surrender their hearts to Him and become the blessed ones of Matthew 5 who have been transformed by His love and made citizens of His kingdom (Philippians 3:20). What will it be like? “And I saw a new heaven and a new earth: for the first heaven and the first earth were passed away; and there was no more sea. And I John saw the holy city, new Jerusalem, coming down from God out of heaven, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband. And I heard a great voice out of heaven saying, Behold, the tabernacle of God is with men, and he will dwell with them, and they shall be his people, and God himself shall be with them, and be their God. And God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes; and there shall be no more death, neither sorrow, nor crying, neither shall there be any more pain: for the former things are passed away. And he that sat upon the throne said, Behold, I make all things new. And he said unto me, Write: for these words are true and faithful.” —Revelation 21:1-5 “And there shall be no more curse: but the throne of God and of the Lamb shall be in it; and his servants shall serve him: and they shall see his face; and his name shall be in their foreheads.” —Revelation 22:3-4 “For thus saith the LORD that created the heavens; God himself that formed the earth and made it; he hath established it, he created it not in vain, he formed it to be inhabited: I am the LORD; and there is none else.” —Isaiah 45:18 “And thou, O tower of the flock, the strong hold of the daughter of Zion, unto thee shall it come, even the first dominion; the kingdom shall come to the daughter of Jerusalem.” —Micah 4:8 As one of the most hope-filled passages in the entire Bible, (Revelation 21:3-4) adds a lot more color to what Peter meant when he said that righteousness will dwell there. And because sin and its curse will be abolished (Genesis 3:17-19), God will be able to dwell among His children, never to be separated again! They will be able to commune with Him the way Adam and Eve did before sin entered the world: face-to-face! These passages also tell us that God did not create earth just to watch it be destroyed by sin. No, He will abolish sin, recreate earth, and make it even more glorious than it was in Eden! He will do the work which Adam, Eve, and their offspring would have done had they never sinned—to populate and build up the earth (Genesis 1:28). God will fill the earth with the people He redeemed, and He will establish the New Jerusalem as its capital! What kind of bodies will the saved have? “Who shall change our vile body, that it may be fashioned like unto his glorious body, according to the working whereby he is able even to subdue all things unto himself.” —Philippians 3:21 “Behold my hands and my feet, that it is I myself: handle me, and see; for a spirit hath not flesh and bones, as ye see me have.” —Luke 24:39 “Strengthen ye the weak hands, and confirm the feeble knees. Say to them that are of a fearful heart, Be strong, fear not: behold, your God will come with vengeance, even God with a recompence; he will come and save you. Then the eyes of the blind shall be opened, and the ears of the deaf shall be unstopped. Then shall the lame man leap as a hart, and the tongue of the dumb sing: for in the wilderness shall waters break out, and streams in the desert.” —Isaiah 35:3-6 The saved will no longer have their mortal, earthly bodies because at Christ’s second coming they will receive new, immortal, and glorious bodies, like the body of Jesus, free from any trace of disease, abnormality, or blemish. Jesus had a real, physical body after His resurrection, and the saved will have a real, physical body in heaven too. Will the sorrows of earth taint the joy of heaven? “For, behold, I create new heavens and a new earth: and the former shall not be remembered, nor come into mind.” —Isaiah 65:17 What will the saved be doing there? “And they shall build houses, and inhabit them; and they shall plant vineyards, and eat the fruit of them. They shall not build, and another inhabit; they shall not plant, and another eat: for as the days of a tree are the days of my people, and mine elect shall long enjoy the work of their hands. They shall not labour in vain, nor bring forth for trouble; for they are the seed of the blessed of the LORD, and their offspring with them.” —Isaiah 65:21-23 “And I say unto you, That many shall come from the east and west, and shall sit down with Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, in the kingdom of heaven.” —Matthew 8:11 In addition to having a mansion in the New Jerusalem built by Jesus (John 14:1-3), the saved will also build their own homes and plant their own vineyards. Real people will be doing real things, and they will be enjoying the fruit of their labor, unlike on earth where hard work can end in disappointment, theft, or sudden destruction. The saved will also have the blessing of friendship and fellowship with one another, including the heroes of the Bible! Will there be predation and killing? “The wolf and the lamb shall feed together, and the lion shall eat straw like the bullock: and dust shall be the serpent’s meat. They shall not hurt nor destroy in all my holy mountain, saith the LORD.” —Isaiah 65:25 “The wolf will live with the lamb, and the leopard will lie down with the goat; the calf and young lion and fatling will be together, and a little child will lead them. The cow will graze with the bear, their young will lie down together, and the lion will eat straw like the ox. The infant will play by the cobra’s den, and the toddler will reach into the viper’s nest. They will neither harm nor destroy on all My holy mountain, for the earth will be full of the knowledge of the LORD as the sea is full of water.” —Isaiah 11:6-9 There will be no death in heaven, which means no predatory behavior either. What else will be different there? “And I saw a new heaven and a new earth: for the first heaven and the first earth were passed away; and there was no more sea.” —Revelation 21:1 “The wilderness and the solitary place shall be glad for them; and the desert shall rejoice, and blossom as the rose.” —Isaiah 35:1 “And there shall be no night there; and they need no candle, neither light of the sun; for the Lord God giveth them light: and they shall reign for ever and ever.” —Revelation 22:5 “But they that wait upon the LORD shall renew their strength; they shall mount up with wings as eagles; they shall run, and not be weary; and they shall walk, and not faint.” —Isaiah 40:31 “And there shall in no wise enter into it any thing that defileth, neither whatsoever worketh abomination, or maketh a lie: but they which are written in the Lamb’s book of life.” —Revelation 21:27 “Violence shall no more be heard in thy land, wasting nor destruction within thy borders; but thou shalt call thy walls Salvation, and thy gates Praise. The sun shall be no more thy light by day; neither for brightness shall the moon give light unto thee: but the LORD shall be unto thee an everlasting light, and thy God thy glory. Thy sun shall no more go down; neither shall thy moon withdraw itself: for the LORD shall be thine everlasting light, and the days of thy mourning shall be ended. Thy people also shall be all righteous: they shall inherit the land for ever, the branch of my planting, the work of my hands, that I may be glorified.” —Isaiah 60:18-21 Vast oceans and deserts make up a large portion of the earth’s surface today, but that will no longer be the case in heaven. There will also be no night there because the brightness of God’s presence will permeate the whole earth. There will be no weariness after hard work, and the saved will be able to fly like the angels, maybe even visiting other unfallen worlds created by God (Job 1:6; Hebrews 1:2; 11:3)! No destruction means there will be no natural disasters. And because heaven is a place where righteousness dwells, there will be nothing there that defiles, meaning no deception, no crime, no drunkenness, no brothels, no abuse, nor any other impurity. The righteous will be clothed with the righteousness of Jesus and will reflect His character of love! What will the New Jerusalem be like? “And the city lieth foursquare, and the length is as large as the breadth: and he measured the city with the reed, twelve thousand furlongs. The length and the breadth and the height of it are equal. And he measured the wall thereof, an hundred and forty and four cubits, according to the measure of a man, that is, of the angel.” —Revelation 21:16-17 “And the building of the wall of it was of jasper: and the city was pure gold, like unto clear glass. And the foundations of the wall of the city were garnished with all manner of precious stones. The first foundation was jasper; the second, sapphire; the third, a chalcedony; the fourth, an emerald; the fifth, sardonyx; the sixth, sardius; the seventh, chrysolite; the eighth, beryl; the ninth, a topaz; the tenth, a chrysoprasus; the eleventh, a jacinth; the twelfth, an amethyst. And the twelve gates were twelve pearls; every several gate was of one pearl: and the street of the city was pure gold, as it were transparent glass.” —Revelation 21:18-21 The city is arranged in a square with its width, length, and height equal. The distance around it is 12,000 furlongs or 1,500 miles (1 furlong is 1/8 of a mile), which means it’s 375 miles long each side! The streets are of pure gold, and the walls are 144 cubits or 216 feet of solid jasper—nearly 20 stories high—with 12 gates total, and each gate is of a single pearl. The city also has 12 foundations with each one of a different precious stone and color, so from a distance it will look like it’s resting upon a rainbow! When the New Jerusalem descends from heaven at the end of the 1,000 years, it will rest on a great plain created for it by Jesus after He flattens the Mount of Olives (Zechariah 14:4-5). What about the food and water supply? “And he shewed me a pure river of water of life, clear as crystal, proceeding out of the throne of God and of the Lamb. In the midst of the street of it, and on either side of the river, was there the tree of life, which bare twelve manner of fruits, and yielded her fruit every month: and the leaves of the tree were for the healing of the nations.” —Revelation 22:1-2 The city is watered by the river of life that flows from the throne of God, while the tree of life produces a different kind of fruit each month! In addition to this, the saved will also plant their own food at the homes they build (Isaiah 65:21). Since there will be no death there, the diet will be what it was before Adam and Eve sinned: fruits, grains, and nuts (Gensis 1:29). Sustained by the fruit and leaves of the tree of life, the saved will experience unfailing youth and vigor throughout eternity! What does Paul say about the glory of heaven? “But as it is written, Eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither have entered into the heart of man, the things which God hath prepared for them that love him.” —1 Corinthians 2:9 “For I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us.” —Romans 8:18 “For which cause we faint not; but though our outward man perish, yet the inward man is renewed day by day. For our light affliction, which is but for a moment, worketh for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory; while we look not at the things which are seen, but at the things which are not seen: for the things which are seen are temporal; but the things which are not seen are eternal.” —2 Corinthians 4:16-18 The joy, bliss, and glory of heaven will be beyond our wildest dreams; in fact, Paul writes that no matter the trials and sufferings that life on earth brings, they are not comparable with the eternal glory of heaven! What does Revelation say about the saved? “He that overcometh shall inherit all things; and I will be his God, and he shall be my son. But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death.” —Revelation 21:7-8 “And they overcame him by the blood of the Lamb, and by the word of their testimony; and they loved not their lives unto the death.” —Revelation 12:11 “These are they which were not defiled with women; for they are virgins. These are they which follow the Lamb whithersoever he goeth. These were redeemed from among men, being the firstfruits unto God and to the Lamb.” —Revelation 14:4 “And the Spirit and the bride say, Come. And let him that heareth say, Come. And let him that is athirst come. And whosoever will, let him take the water of life freely.” —Revelation 22:17 Those who overcome sin will inherit all things. And how do they overcome? By the blood of the Lamb. The Bible is clear that my only hope of overcoming the defiling sin in my heart is through the power of Jesus working in my life. There is no other way. The whole reason why Jesus left the courts of heaven to live a life of victory on earth and die a humiliating death on the cross on my behalf is because He longs to save me from the filthiness of sin (Matthew 1:21). And He gives this offer of salvation freely. Will I choose to renounce sin and follow the Lamb wherever He goes? What am I to do while waiting for God’s literal kingdom? “In those days came John the Baptist, preaching in the wilderness of Judaea, and saying, Repent ye: for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.” —Matthew 3:1-2 “And when he was demanded of the Pharisees, when the kingdom of God should come, he answered them and said, The kingdom of God cometh not with observation: neither shall they say, Lo here! or, lo there! for, behold, the kingdom of God is within you.” —Luke 17:20-21 “But seek ye first the kingdom of God, and his righteousness; and all these things shall be added unto you.” —Matthew 6:33 “Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done in earth, as it is in heaven.” —Matthew 6:10 When John the Baptist said the kingdom of God is “at hand,” he meant that the spiritual kingdom is already available now! I can experience the love, joy, and peace of God’s spiritual kingdom in my life today when I accept Jesus and give Him the throne of my heart! If seeking His kingdom and righteousness becomes my first priority in life, He will provide everything else for me. May the prayer of Jesus in (Matthew 6:10) be the prayer of my heart every day of my life.\"},\"6\":{\"title\":\"Is Hell Forever?\",\"url\":\"/basics/hell/\",\"category\":\"Basics\",\"description\":\"Will a just and loving God torture people in a never ending hell for only a lifetime of sin?\",\"body\":\"How many does Jesus want to save? “The Lord is not slack concerning his promise, as some men count slackness; but is longsuffering to us-ward, not willing that any should perish, but that all should come to repentance.” —2 Peter 3:9 “For this is good and acceptable in the sight of God our Savior, who desires all men to be saved and to come to the knowledge of the truth.” —1 Timothy 2:3-4, NKJV If God could save every single person, without infringing on their freedom to choose, He would, but this He does not do, because He respects every person’s free will. Instead, He knocks patiently at the door of every heart (Revelation 3:20), waiting to be let in. What is He like? “The LORD hath appeared of old unto me, saying, Yea, I have loved thee with an everlasting love: therefore with lovingkindness have I drawn thee.” —Jeremiah 31:3 “But as he which hath called you is holy, so be ye holy in all manner of conversation; because it is written, Be ye holy; for I am holy.” —1 Peter 1:15-16 “Take heed unto yourselves, lest ye forget the covenant of the LORD your God, which he made with you, and make you a graven image, or the likeness of any thing, which the LORD thy God hath forbidden thee. For the LORD thy God is a consuming fire, even a jealous God.” —Deuteronomy 4:23-24 God is love, but He is also holy. He loves the sinner and has made ample provision for salvation from sin, because sin, and anyone who chooses to cling to it, cannot exist in the presence of a holy God—He is a consuming fire to it. What does the Bible say about the wicked? “Say unto them, As I live, saith the Lord GOD, I have no pleasure in the death of the wicked; but that the wicked turn from his way and live: turn ye, turn ye from your evil ways; for why will ye die, O house of Israel?” —Ezekiel 33:11 “For the LORD shall rise up as in mount Perazim, he shall be wroth as in the valley of Gibeon, that he may do his work, his strange work; and bring to pass his act, his strange act.” —Isaiah 28:21 “For, behold, the day cometh, that shall burn as an oven; and all the proud, yea, and all that do wickedly, shall be stubble: and the day that cometh shall burn them up, saith the LORD of hosts, that it shall leave them neither root nor branch. But unto you that fear my name shall the Sun of righteousness arise with healing in his wings; and ye shall go forth, and grow up as calves of the stall. And ye shall tread down the wicked; for they shall be ashes under the soles of your feet in the day that I shall do this, saith the LORD of hosts.” —Malachi 4:1-3 Because the wicked choose to cling to sin, which, at its core, is selfishness and in complete opposition to God’s government of self-sacrificing love, He has no other choice but to leave them to the consequence of their choice—death (Romans 6:23). The Bible calls this a strange act because God has no pleasure in the death of the wicked; these are people for whom He died, but because they refuse to turn from their path of sin and destruction, He must respect their choice and leave them to its consequences so that the curse of sin—the misery, suffering, and ruin—can be finally blotted out. Note also that Malachi says the fire will burn them up and turn them into ashes, meaning they will not burn in hell forever. What does the Psalmist have to say? “For yet a little while, and the wicked shall not be: yea, thou shalt diligently consider his place, and it shall not be.” —Psalm 37:10 “But the wicked shall perish, and the enemies of the LORD shall be as the fat of lambs: they shall consume; into smoke shall they consume away.” —Psalm 37:20 “Yet he passed away, and, lo, he was not: yea, I sought him, but he could not be found.” —Psalm 37:36 These verses are clear that the wicked will cease to exist after the fire finishes its work. They will not be suffering in hell for eternity. What about Matthew 25:46? “And these shall go away into everlasting punishment: but the righteous into life eternal.” —Matthew 25:46 The word “everlasting” here refers to the eternal consequences of the punishment—it is final. How is the fire of Sodom and Gomorrha described? “Even as Sodom and Gomorrha, and the cities about them in like manner, giving themselves over to fornication, and going after strange flesh, are set forth for an example, suffering the vengeance of eternal fire.” —Jude 7 “And turning the cities of Sodom and Gomorrha into ashes condemned them with an overthrow, making them an ensample unto those that after should live ungodly.” —2 Peter 2:6 The fire that destroyed Sodom and Gomorrha was an eternal fire too, but, obviously, the cities are no longer burning. The Bible is referring to the eternal consequences of the fire, which turned the cities into ashes—never to exist again. Doesn’t the Bible talk about unquenchable fire? “I indeed baptize you with water unto repentance: but he that cometh after me is mightier than I, whose shoes I am not worthy to bear: he shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost, and with fire: whose fan is in his hand, and he will throughly purge his floor, and gather his wheat into the garner; but he will burn up the chaff with unquenchable fire.” —Matthew 3:11-12 The fire is unquenchable in the sense that nothing can put it out until it finishes its work. Is there another instance of this in the Bible? “Thus saith the LORD; Take heed to yourselves, and bear no burden on the sabbath day, nor bring it in by the gates of Jerusalem; neither carry forth a burden out of your houses on the sabbath day, neither do ye any work, but hallow ye the sabbath day, as I commanded your fathers. But they obeyed not, neither inclined their ear, but made their neck stiff, that they might not hear, nor receive instruction. ““And it shall come to pass, if ye diligently hearken unto me, saith the LORD, to bring in no burden through the gates of this city on the sabbath day, but hallow the sabbath day, to do no work therein; then shall there enter into the gates of this city kings and princes sitting upon the throne of David, riding in chariots and on horses, they, and their princes, the men of Judah, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem: and this city shall remain for ever. And they shall come from the cities of Judah, and from the places about Jerusalem, and from the land of Benjamin, and from the plain, and from the mountains, and from the south, bringing burnt offerings, and sacrifices, and meat offerings, and incense, and bringing sacrifices of praise, unto the house of the LORD. ““But if ye will not hearken unto me to hallow the sabbath day, and not to bear a burden, even entering in at the gates of Jerusalem on the sabbath day; then will I kindle a fire in the gates thereof, and it shall devour the palaces of Jerusalem, and it shall not be quenched.” —Jeremiah 17:19-27 “Then they burned the house of God, broke down the wall of Jerusalem, burned all its palaces with fire, and destroyed all its precious possessions. And those who escaped from the sword he carried away to Babylon, where they became servants to him and his sons until the rule of the kingdom of Persia, to fulfill the word of the Lord by the mouth of Jeremiah, until the land had enjoyed her Sabbaths. As long as she lay desolate she kept Sabbath, to fulfill seventy years.” —2 Chronicles 36:21-27 2 Chronicles 36 was the fulfillment of the prophecy given by Jeremiah in chapter 17. Obviously, the fire is no longer burning, but when it was burning, it was an unquenchable fire that could not be put out until it consumed everything. What about Revelation 20:10? “And the devil that deceived them was cast into the lake of fire and brimstone, where the beast and the false prophet are, and shall be tormented day and night for ever and ever.” —Revelation 20:10 “Then his master shall bring him unto the judges; he shall also bring him to the door, or unto the door post; and his master shall bore his ear through with an aul; and he shall serve him for ever.” —Exodus 21:6 “But Hannah went not up; for she said unto her husband, I will not go up until the child be weaned, and then I will bring him, that he may appear before the LORD, and there abide for ever. … Therefore also I have lent him to the LORD; as long as he liveth he shall be lent to the LORD. And he worshipped the LORD there.” —1 Samuel 1:22, 28 The Greek word for “for ever” in Revelation 20:10 is “aion.” It’s where the word “eon” comes from. In the Bible it’s often used to indicate an unspecified period of time. In Exodus 21:6 it represents the life of a slave, and in 1 Samuel 1:22, 28 it means as long as Samuel lives; likewise, in Revelation 20:10 it means the torment lasts until death brings it to an end. Where and when will the fire come down? “As therefore the tares are gathered and burned in the fire; so shall it be in the end of this world. The Son of man shall send forth his angels, and they shall gather out of his kingdom all things that offend, and them which do iniquity; and shall cast them into a furnace of fire: there shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth.” —Matthew 13:40-42 “But the day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night; in the which the heavens shall pass away with a great noise, and the elements shall melt with fervent heat, the earth also and the works that are therein shall be burned up.” —2 Peter 3:10 “And they went up on the breadth of the earth, and compassed the camp of the saints about, and the beloved city: and fire came down from God out of heaven, and devoured them.” —Revelation 20:9 The Bible says the fire comes down on earth at the end of the 1,000 year period when the wicked are raised from the dead and Satan deceives them, for the last time, to make an attempt to capture the New Jerusalem. This is referred to as “the end of the world” in other Bible passages because it is God’s final act of cleansing the world of sin. This also means there is no one burning in hell now. The Bible makes it clear that the dead are in their graves waiting for the resurrection: the saved are waiting for the first resurrection at the second coming of Christ, while the lost are waiting for the second resurrection at the end of the 1,000 years. Who else will be destroyed? “For if God spared not the angels that sinned, but cast them down to hell, and delivered them into chains of darkness, to be reserved unto judgment.” —2 Peter 2:4 “Thine heart was lifted up because of thy beauty, thou hast corrupted thy wisdom by reason of thy brightness: I will cast thee to the ground, I will lay thee before kings, that they may behold thee. Thou hast defiled thy sanctuaries by the multitude of thine iniquities, by the iniquity of thy traffick; therefore will I bring forth a fire from the midst of thee, it shall devour thee, and I will bring thee to ashes upon the earth in the sight of all them that behold thee.” —Ezekiel 28:17-18 The fire cleanses the earth from all traces of sin, and so the fallen angels, including Satan, will also be destroyed by it, turning them to ashes, since the entire rebellion against God started with Satan and the angels he managed to deceive. Is everyone punished equally? “And that servant, which knew his lord’s will, and prepared not himself, neither did according to his will, shall be beaten with many stripes. But he that knew not, and did commit things worthy of stripes, shall be beaten with few stripes. For unto whomsoever much is given, of him shall be much required: and to whom men have committed much, of him they will ask the more.” —Luke 12:47-48 “And, behold, I come quickly; and my reward is with me, to give every man according as his work shall be.” —Revelation 22:12 “For the Son of man shall come in the glory of his Father with his angels; and then he shall reward every man according to his works.” —Matthew 16:27 The punishment is according to a person’s deeds. Those who are guilty of henious crimes against humanity will suffer longer than those who are not. It would be unjust and unfair any other way. What is the result of the fire? “For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.” —Romans 6:23 “Behold, they shall be as stubble; the fire shall burn them; they shall not deliver themselves from the power of the flame: there shall not be a coal to warm at, nor fire to sit before it.” —Isaiah 47:14 “For the day of the LORD is near upon all the heathen: as thou hast done, it shall be done unto thee: thy reward shall return upon thine own head. For as ye have drunk upon my holy mountain, so shall all the heathen drink continually, yea, they shall drink, and they shall swallow down, and they shall be as though they had not been.” —Obadiah 1:15-16 Hell cannot burn forever because the wages of sin are death, not eternal torment for a short life of sin. How cruel would that be! This eternal hell teaching goes all the way back to the Garden of Eden where Satan told Eve she would surely not die (Genesis 3:4) even though God clearly said that sin brings death (Genesis 2:17). But make no mistake, Jesus would rather die on the cross Himself than watch His creation destroyed by fire; nevertheless, He also respects every person’s freedom of choice, and in an effort to purge the world from the misery of sin, it is, ultimately, an act of love to bring the rebellion to an end. And so the fire will burn out once it finishes its work, and there will be not a coal left to warm at. Satan, his angels, and the wicked will cease to exist, never to live again. In Christianity, this is known as annihilationism. What happens once it goes out? “Looking for and hasting unto the coming of the day of God, wherein the heavens being on fire shall be dissolved, and the elements shall melt with fervent heat? Nevertheless we, according to his promise, look for new heavens and a new earth, wherein dwelleth righteousness.” —2 Peter 3:12-13 “And I saw a new heaven and a new earth: for the first heaven and the first earth were passed away; and there was no more sea. And I John saw the holy city, new Jerusalem, coming down from God out of heaven, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband. And I heard a great voice out of heaven saying, Behold, the tabernacle of God is with men, and he will dwell with them, and they shall be his people, and God himself shall be with them, and be their God. And God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes; and there shall be no more death, neither sorrow, nor crying, neither shall there be any more pain: for the former things are passed away.” —Revelation 21:1-4 “What do ye imagine against the LORD? he will make an utter end: affliction shall not rise up the second time.” —Nahum 1:9 Once every trace of sin is wiped out, God will create a new heaven and a new earth in which righteousness dwells. The universe will be forever secure from the curse of sin ever rising again because everyone will know, from experience, that God is love. The rebellion brought out the love of Jesus and the Father like nothing else could, and it was their love that conquered it.\",\"series\":\"Mainstream Deceptions\"},\"7\":{\"title\":\"Keeping the Sabbath\",\"url\":\"/basics/keeping/\",\"category\":\"Basics\",\"description\":\"Discover biblical guidance on keeping God’s seventh-day Sabbath the way He intended it.\",\"body\":\"What does Isaiah say about keeping the Sabbath? “Blessed is the man that doeth this, and the son of man that layeth hold on it; that keepeth the sabbath from polluting it, and keepeth his hand from doing any evil.” —Isaiah 56:2 Our heavenly Father pronounces a blessing on everyone who chooses to keep His Sabbath holy. Is this confirmed elsewhere? “For in six days the LORD made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that in them is, and rested the seventh day: wherefore the LORD blessed the sabbath day, and hallowed it.” —Exodus 20:11 “And it shall come to pass, if thou shalt hearken diligently unto the voice of the LORD thy God, to observe and to do all his commandments which I command thee this day, that the LORD thy God will set thee on high above all nations of the earth: and all these blessings shall come on thee, and overtake thee, if thou shalt hearken unto the voice of the LORD thy God. … But it shall come to pass, if thou wilt not hearken unto the voice of the LORD thy God, to observe to do all his commandments and his statutes which I command thee this day; that all these curses shall come upon thee, and overtake thee.” —Deuteronomy 28:1-2, 15 The Sabbath was not made to be a burden, but a blessing to the human race. Those who keep it partake of that blessing on a weekly basis. In Deuteronomy 28, God pronounces additional blessings on those who keep His commandments, including the fourth. How is the Sabbath to be kept? “Remember the sabbath day, to keep it holy. Six days shalt thou labour, and do all thy work: but the seventh day is the sabbath of the LORD thy God: in it thou shalt not do any work, thou, nor thy son, nor thy daughter, thy manservant, nor thy maidservant, nor thy cattle, nor thy stranger that is within thy gates: for in six days the LORD made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that in them is, and rested the seventh day: wherefore the LORD blessed the sabbath day, and hallowed it.” —Exodus 20:8-11 The Sabbath was instituted to provide rest and refuge in and through Christ (Matthew 11:28-30). It is a special weekly blessing for everyone who chooses to rest from their works by trusting in Him. We may have a long list of things to do, but we can still set them aside in order to have time to connect with God and acknowledge His supremacy in our lives. This rest from work extends to everyone “within our gates,” meaning those under our authority. How did Jesus keep it? “And he came to Nazareth, where he had been brought up: and, as his custom was, he went into the synagogue on the sabbath day, and stood up for to read.” —Luke 4:16 “And they went into Capernaum; and straightway on the sabbath day he entered into the synagogue, and taught.” —Mark 1:21 “And when the sabbath day was come, he began to teach in the synagogue: and many hearing him were astonished, saying, From whence hath this man these things? and what wisdom is this which is given unto him, that even such mighty works are wrought by his hands?” —Mark 6:2 “And it came to pass also on another sabbath, that he entered into the synagogue and taught: and there was a man whose right hand was withered.” —Luke 6:6 Looking to Jesus as our example in all things, we learn that Sabbath keeping also involves gathering with other believers for worship, spiritual nourishment, and fellowship. The verses above also show that teaching was a vital part of the synagogue experience, meaning it was far more than a casual weekly social gathering. It was a place for studying Scripture, where worshippers could learn, share, and become grounded in the truth (2 Timothy 2:15). Was this the case in the Old Testament too? “Six days shall work be done: but the seventh day is the sabbath of rest, an holy convocation; ye shall do no work therein: it is the sabbath of the LORD in all your dwellings.” —Leviticus 23:3 Not only is the Sabbath a time to convene with other believers, but this convening is called holy. Corporate praise and worship of God, praying with and for one another (Acts 16:13), Bible study, and fellowship (especially when we use it to share our experiences with God) are all integral parts of making the Sabbath a delight. When does the Sabbath start and end? “It is to be a Sabbath of complete rest for you, and you shall humble yourselves; on the ninth of the month at evening, from evening until evening, you shall keep your Sabbath.” —Leviticus 23:32, NASB “And God called the light Day, and the darkness he called Night. And the evening and the morning were the first day.” —Genesis 1:5 In the Bible, a day does not begin and end at midnight; it starts at sunset and continues until the following sunset. In the Genesis account, each day includes the prior evening as well, so since the Sabbath is the seventh day of the week, it begins at sunset on Friday and ends at sunset on Saturday. What insight does Isaiah give? “If thou turn away thy foot from the sabbath, from doing thy pleasure on my holy day; and call the sabbath a delight, the holy of the LORD, honourable; and shalt honour him, not doing thine own ways, nor finding thine own pleasure, nor speaking thine own words: then shalt thou delight thyself in the LORD; and I will cause thee to ride upon the high places of the earth, and feed thee with the heritage of Jacob thy father: for the mouth of the LORD hath spoken it.” —Isaiah 58:13-14 The Sabbath becomes a delight when Jesus is at its center—when we put away our own pursuits and rest from the cares of life to focus on the eternal things of God. It’s a special day to reflect on, honor, and connect with Him. Simply put, it is a day to delight in Him. The motivation behind Sabbath-keeping is crucial because it determines whether the day becomes a delight or a burden. Only when we keep it out of love for Christ—rather than duty—are we enabled to deny self and still call the Sabbath a delight. The truly born-again follower of Christ transitions from an attitude of “Don’t tell me what to do” to “What would You have me do?” What can we learn from the experience of Nehemiah? “In those days saw I in Judah some treading wine presses on the sabbath, and bringing in sheaves, and lading asses; as also wine, grapes, and figs, and all manner of burdens, which they brought into Jerusalem on the sabbath day: and I testified against them in the day wherein they sold victuals. There dwelt men of Tyre also therein, which brought fish, and all manner of ware, and sold on the sabbath unto the children of Judah, and in Jerusalem. Then I contended with the nobles of Judah, and said unto them, What evil thing is this that ye do, and profane the sabbath day? Did not your fathers thus, and did not our God bring all this evil upon us, and upon this city? yet ye bring more wrath upon Israel by profaning the sabbath. ““And it came to pass, that when the gates of Jerusalem began to be dark before the sabbath, I commanded that the gates should be shut, and charged that they should not be opened till after the sabbath: and some of my servants set I at the gates, that there should no burden be brought in on the sabbath day. So the merchants and sellers of all kind of ware lodged without Jerusalem once or twice. Then I testified against them, and said unto them, Why lodge ye about the wall? if ye do so again, I will lay hands on you. From that time forth came they no more on the sabbath. And I commanded the Levites that they should cleanse themselves, and that they should come and keep the gates, to sanctify the sabbath day.” —Nehemiah 13:15-22 We can clearly see that buying, selling, and conducting business to generate income are activities that profane the Sabbath day. This can pose a challenge for some professions; for example, it would not be right to abandon those in need of medical care on the Sabbath for example. However, as far as possible, we should seek to rest from secular activities in order to honor our Creator. What activities are encouraged on the Sabbath? “And he said unto them, What man shall there be among you, that shall have one sheep, and if it fall into a pit on the sabbath day, will he not lay hold on it, and lift it out? How much then is a man better than a sheep? Wherefore it is lawful to do well on the sabbath days. Then saith he to the man, Stretch forth thine hand. And he stretched it forth; and it was restored whole, like as the other.” —Matthew 12:11-13 Jesus continued to heal on the Sabbath, contrary to the traditions of the religious leaders of His time. Ministry to the sick, the needy, and the discouraged—by relieving their physical, emotional, or spiritual suffering—extends the blessing and delight of the Sabbath beyond ourselves to others. Any other activities? “Remember the sabbath day, to keep it holy. Six days shalt thou labour, and do all thy work: But the seventh day is the sabbath of the LORD thy God: in it thou shalt not do any work, thou, nor thy son, nor thy daughter, thy manservant, nor thy maidservant, nor thy cattle, nor thy stranger that is within thy gates: For in six days the LORD made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that in them is, and rested the seventh day: wherefore the LORD blessed the sabbath day, and hallowed it.” —Exodus 20:8-11 “And on the sabbath we went out of the city by a river side, where prayer was wont to be made; and we sat down, and spake unto the women which resorted thither.” —Acts 16:13 Since the Sabbath is a memorial of God as Creator and Redeemer, spending time in nature contemplating His wondrous works—and the power of His word that created them—can be an incredibly inspiring Sabbath activity. The Word that took a dark, formless earth (Genesis 1:2) and brought it to life still has the same power today to recreate our broken characters in His image (John 6:63; 1 Peter 1:25). His redemptive power is available to all who turn to His Word, the Bible, and claim His promises by faith (Ezekiel 36:25-27; Jeremiah 31:33; 2 Corinthians 5:17; Galatians 3:22). One more thing worth mentioning: Acts 16:13 shows us that prayer can be the perfect complement to time spent in nature. As we contemplate God’s creation, we may find ourselves naturally drawn into prayer—thanking and praising Him for what He has done, or simply sharing what is on our hearts. For whom was the Sabbath instituted? “And it came to pass, that he went through the corn fields on the sabbath day; and his disciples began, as they went, to pluck the ears of corn. And the Pharisees said unto him, Behold, why do they on the sabbath day that which is not lawful? And he said unto them, Have ye never read what David did, when he had need, and was an hungred, he, and they that were with him? How he went into the house of God in the days of Abiathar the high priest, and did eat the shewbread, which is not lawful to eat but for the priests, and gave also to them which were with him? And he said unto them, The sabbath was made for man, and not man for the sabbath: therefore the Son of man is Lord also of the sabbath.” —Mark 2:23-28 The Pharisees added so many man-made rules in an effort to protect the Sabbath’s holiness that they turned it into a burden. But Jesus did not follow their rules—He followed His Father’s will regarding proper Sabbath-keeping. In fact, Jesus clarified that the Sabbath was made for us, not the other way around (For a more in-depth look at how to keep the Sabbath holy, see Doug Batchelor’s book How to Keep the Sabbath Holy.) How can an unholy person keep the Sabbath holy? “For I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ: for it is the power of God unto salvation to every one that believeth; to the Jew first, and also to the Greek. For therein is the righteousness of God revealed from faith to faith: as it is written, The just shall live by faith.” —Romans 1:16-17 “… for whatsoever is not of faith is sin.” —Romans 14:23 “I am crucified with Christ: nevertheless I live; yet not I, but Christ liveth in me: and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God, who loved me, and gave himself for me.” —Galatians 2:20 The only way the Sabbath can be kept holy is in Christ and by faith. Without Christ living in us by faith, through His Spirit (John 14:17; Ephesians 2:22), we are completely incapable of keeping it holy. According to Paul, it is not even our own faith that enables this, but Christ’s faith working in us! No wonder Revelation speaks of a group of God’s faithful people who “keep the commandments of God and the faith of Jesus” (Revelation 14:12). Trying to keep His commandments in any way other than by faith is like asking a plant to grow without sunlight—an impossibility. In Jeremiah 31:33, God promised to write His law in our hearts. Do we believe Him? If He said it, He will fulfill it; we just have to ask! Have we asked Him, claimed His promise by faith, and thanked Him for doing it—even before we see any results? This is faith: taking God at His Word because He cannot lie (Numbers 23:19). Of course, we always have the freedom to interfere with or disrupt this process by filling our minds with things that glamorize sin. But if we choose to cooperate with Him, He will complete the work He began in us (Hebrews 12:2; Jude 1:24-25), and we will be able to genuinely say, “I delight to do thy will, O my God: yea, thy law is within my heart” (Psalm 40:8). Will God provide for my needs? “And the LORD said unto Moses, How long refuse ye to keep my commandments and my laws? See, for that the LORD hath given you the sabbath, therefore he giveth you on the sixth day the bread of two days; abide ye every man in his place, let no man go out of his place on the seventh day. So the people rested on the seventh day.” —Exodus 16:28-30 “Wherefore the LORD God of Israel saith, I said indeed that thy house, and the house of thy father, should walk before me for ever: but now the LORD saith, Be it far from me; for them that honour me I will honour, and they that despise me shall be lightly esteemed.” —1 Samuel 2:30 It may be tempting to worry about lost income on the Sabbath, but just as God miraculously provided a double portion of manna for the Israelites on Friday so they would have enough for Saturday, He will also provide for our needs today when we choose to honor Him by resting on His holy day. What promise does Jesus give me? “Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest. Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me; for I am meek and lowly in heart: and ye shall find rest unto your souls. For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light.” —Matthew 11:28-30 “For this is the love of God, that we keep his commandments: and his commandments are not grievous.” —1 John 5:3 The Pharisees turned the Sabbath into a burdensome yoke, but Jesus came to restore it as the delight it was always meant to be. If keeping the Sabbath feels like a burden, ask Him to help you experience its true joy—and He certainly will.\",\"series\":\"The Bible Sabbath\"},\"8\":{\"title\":\"Messianic Prophecies\",\"url\":\"/basics/messiah/\",\"category\":\"Basics\",\"description\":\"Learn about the astounding Old Testament prophecies of the Messiah that were fulfilled in the life of Jesus.\",\"body\":\"Where was Jesus to be born? “But thou, Bethlehem Ephratah, though thou be little among the thousands of Judah, yet out of thee shall he come forth unto me that is to be ruler in Israel; whose goings forth have been from of old, from everlasting.” —Micah 5:2 “Now when Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judaea in the days of Herod the king, behold, there came wise men from the east to Jerusalem.” —Matthew 2:1 Long before Jesus was born, the prophet Micah foretold that Jesus would be born in the town of Bethlehem. What would be the manner of His conception? “Therefore the Lord himself shall give you a sign; Behold, a virgin shall conceive, and bear a son, and shall call his name Immanuel.” —Isaiah 7:14 “And the angel said unto her, Fear not, Mary: for thou hast found favour with God. And, behold, thou shalt conceive in thy womb, and bring forth a son, and shalt call his name JESUS. He shall be great, and shall be called the Son of the Highest: and the Lord God shall give unto him the throne of his father David: And he shall reign over the house of Jacob for ever; and of his kingdom there shall be no end. Then said Mary unto the angel, How shall this be, seeing I know not a man?” —Luke 1:30-34 “But while he thought on these things, behold, the angel of the Lord appeared unto him in a dream, saying, Joseph, thou son of David, fear not to take unto thee Mary thy wife: for that which is conceived in her is of the Holy Ghost.” —Matthew 1:20 What lineage would He come from? “I shall see him, but not now: I shall behold him, but not nigh: there shall come a Star out of Jacob, and a Sceptre shall rise out of Israel.” —Numbers 24:17 “Judah, thou art he whom thy brethren shall praise: thy hand shall be in the neck of thine enemies; thy father’s children shall bow down before thee. Judah is a lion’s whelp: from the prey, my son, thou art gone up: he stooped down, he couched as a lion, and as an old lion; who shall rouse him up? The sceptre shall not depart from Judah, nor a lawgiver from between his feet, until Shiloh come; and unto him shall the gathering of the people be.” —Genesis 49:8-10 “Behold, the days come, saith the Lord, that I will raise unto David a righteous Branch, and a King shall reign and prosper, and shall execute judgment and justice in the earth.” —Jeremiah 23:5 These prophecies came from different time periods and different prophets, but they all accurately foretold that Jesus would come from the lineage of Jacob, Judah, and king David. What was said about His ministry? “The Spirit of the Lord GOD is upon me; because the LORD hath anointed me to preach good tidings unto the meek; he hath sent me to bind up the brokenhearted, to proclaim liberty to the captives, and the opening of the prison to them that are bound; To proclaim the acceptable year of the LORD, and the day of vengeance of our God; to comfort all that mourn; To appoint unto them that mourn in Zion, to give unto them beauty for ashes, the oil of joy for mourning, the garment of praise for the spirit of heaviness; that they might be called trees of righteousness, the planting of the LORD, that he might be glorified.” —Isaiah 61:1-3 Who would betray Him? “For it was not an enemy that reproached me; then I could have borne it: neither was it he that hated me that did magnify himself against me; then I would have hid myself from him: But it was thou, a man mine equal, my guide, and mine acquaintance.” —Psalm 55:12-13 “Yea, mine own familiar friend, in whom I trusted, which did eat of my bread, hath lifted up his heel against me.” —Psalm 41:9 “When Jesus had said these things, He was troubled in spirit, and testified and said, “Most assuredly, I say to you, one of you will betray Me.” Then the disciples looked at one another, perplexed about whom He spoke. &hellip; Jesus answered, “It is he to whom I shall give a piece of bread when I have dipped it.” And having dipped the bread, He gave it to Judas Iscariot, the son of Simon.” —John 13:21-22, 26, NKJV Jesus was betrayed by a friend, one of His own disciples, and even the act that initiated the betrayal was accurately foretold—the eating of bread. How much would He be sold for? “And I said unto them, If ye think good, give me my price; and if not, forbear. So they weighed for my price thirty pieces of silver. And the LORD said unto me, Cast it unto the potter: a goodly price that I was prised at of them. And I took the thirty pieces of silver, and cast them to the potter in the house of the LORD.” —Zechariah 11:12-13 “Then Judas, which had betrayed him, when he saw that he was condemned, repented himself, and brought again the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and elders, Saying, I have sinned in that I have betrayed the innocent blood. And they said, What is that to us? see thou to that. And he cast down the pieces of silver in the temple, and departed, and went and hanged himself. And the chief priests took the silver pieces, and said, It is not lawful for to put them into the treasury, because it is the price of blood. And they took counsel, and bought with them the potter’s field, to bury strangers in.” —Matthew 27:3-7 “If the ox shall push a manservant or a maidservant; he shall give unto their master thirty shekels of silver, and the ox shall be stoned.” —Exodus 21:32 Jesus was sold for thirty pieces of silver, the price of a slave, but not only was the amount accurately foretold, but also Judas’ act of throwing the money into the temple, as well as that money subsequently going to a potter! How would He suffer? “Surely He hath borne our griefs, and carried our sorrows: yet we did esteem Him stricken, smitten of God, and afflicted. But He was wounded for our transgressions, He was bruised for our iniquities: the chastisement of our peace was upon Him; and with His stripes we are healed. All we like sheep have gone astray; we have turned every one to his own way; and the Lord hath laid on Him the iniquity of us all. He was oppressed, and He was afflicted, yet He opened not His mouth: He is brought as a lamb to the slaughter, and as a sheep before her shearers is dumb, so He openeth not His mouth.” —Isaiah 53:4-7 What would happen to his hands and feet? “For dogs have compassed me: the assembly of the wicked have inclosed me: they pierced my hands and my feet.” —Psalm 22:16 “And when they were come to the place, which is called Calvary, there they crucified him, and the malefactors, one on the right hand, and the other on the left. Then said Jesus, Father, forgive them; for they know not what they do.” —Luke 23:33-34 What about His clothing? “They divide My garments among them, and for My clothing they cast lots.” —Psalm 22:18, NKJV “And when they had crucified him, they parted his garments, casting lots upon them, what every man should take.” —Mark 15:24 What about His cry on the cross? “My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me? why art thou so far from helping me, and from the words of my roaring?” —Psalm 22:1 “And about the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, saying, Eli, Eli, lama sabachthani? that is to say, My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?” —Matthew 27:46 Was anything said about the timing of His death? “Observe the month of Abib, and keep the passover unto the LORD thy God: for in the month of Abib the LORD thy God brought thee forth out of Egypt by night.” —Deuteronomy 16:1 “Your lamb shall be without blemish, a male of the first year: ye shall take it out from the sheep, or from the goats: And ye shall keep it up until the fourteenth day of the same month: and the whole assembly of the congregation of Israel shall kill it in the evening.” —Exodus 12:5-6 “Purge out therefore the old leaven, that ye may be a new lump, as ye are unleavened. For even Christ our passover is sacrificed for us.” —1 Corinthians 5:7 In an incredible fulfillment of prophecy, Jesus, the Passover lamb to whom all the prior Passover feasts were pointing, died on the fourteenth day of the Hebrew month of Abib at about the ninth hour (Matthew 27:46-50). Would any of His bones be broken? “He keepeth all his bones: not one of them is broken.” —Psalm 34:20 “Then came the soldiers, and brake the legs of the first, and of the other which was crucified with him. But when they came to Jesus, and saw that he was dead already, they brake not his legs.” —John 19:32-33 What was said about His grave? “And His grave was assigned with wicked men, yet He was with a rich man in His death, because He had done no violence, nor was there any deceit in His mouth.” —Isaiah 53:9, NASB “When the even was come, there came a rich man of Arimathaea, named Joseph, who also himself was Jesus’ disciple: He went to Pilate, and begged the body of Jesus. Then Pilate commanded the body to be delivered. And when Joseph had taken the body, he wrapped it in a clean linen cloth, And laid it in his own new tomb, which he had hewn out in the rock: and he rolled a great stone to the door of the sepulchre, and departed.” —Matthew 27:57-60 Would He remain in the grave forever? “For you will not leave my soul among the dead or allow your Holy One to rot in the grave.” —Psalm 16:10, NLT “I am he that liveth, and was dead; and, behold, I am alive for evermore, amen; and have the keys of hell and of death.” —Revelation 1:18 Because death could not conquer the Author and Giver of life, we also have the hope of resurrection!\",\"series\":\"Jesus, the Messiah\"},\"9\":{\"title\":\"Keys to Effective Prayer\",\"url\":\"/basics/prayer/\",\"category\":\"Basics\",\"description\":\"Prayer is foundational to the Christian walk. Are there biblical principles that can make our prayers more effective?\",\"body\":\"Should I be praying more? “And he withdrew himself into the wilderness, and prayed.” —Luke 5:16 “And in the morning, rising up a great while before day, he went out, and departed into a solitary place, and there prayed.” —Mark 5:17 “And when he had sent them away, he departed into a mountain to pray.” —Mark 6:46 “And they came to a place which was named Gethsemane: and he saith to his disciples, Sit ye here, while I shall pray.” —Mark 14:32 The Bible tells us that Jesus, our example, was a man of prayer. If He had a need to pray, how much more do we? Does God hear my prayers? “If ye then, being evil, know how to give good gifts unto your children: how much more shall your heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to them that ask him?” —Luke 11:13 “If ye then, being evil, know how to give good gifts unto your children, how much more shall your Father which is in heaven give good things to them that ask him?” —Matthew 7:11 “O thou that hearest prayer, unto thee shall all flesh come.” —Psalm 65:2 Jesus made it clear that our heavenly Father wants us to come to Him in prayer. He is more willing to grant our requests than parents are to give good gifts to their children. Of course, He doesn’t grant every request, but only those that will result in “good things” (Matthew 7:11)—that is, those in harmony with His wise and loving will for us. What heart posture is needed? “And he arose, and came to his father. But when he was yet a great way off, his father saw him, and had compassion, and ran, and fell on his neck, and kissed him. And the son said unto him, Father, I have sinned against heaven, and in thy sight, and am no more worthy to be called thy son.” —Luke 15:20-21 “Two men went up into the temple to pray; the one a Pharisee, and the other a publican. The Pharisee stood and prayed thus with himself, God, I thank thee, that I am not as other men are, extortioners, unjust, adulterers, or even as this publican. I fast twice in the week, I give tithes of all that I possess. And the publican, standing afar off, would not lift up so much as his eyes unto heaven, but smote upon his breast, saying, God be merciful to me a sinner. I tell you, this man went down to his house justified rather than the other: for every one that exalteth himself shall be abased; and he that humbleth himself shall be exalted.” —Luke 18:10-14 “And Jesus answering said unto them, They that are whole need not a physician; but they that are sick. I came not to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance.” —Luke 5:31-32 Being aware of our true relationship to God leads to prayers rooted in humility and reverence for Him—a consciousness of His holiness and wisdom, as well as our own unworthiness. It is only through the blood of Christ, shed for our sins, that we have been reconciled to our heavenly Father and enabled to come to Him in prayer. The Pharisee felt self-sufficient and therefore saw no need of Jesus, but the publican and the prodigal son were keenly aware of their unworthiness. Jesus made it clear that those who believe they are righteous feel little need of His righteousness, but those who recognize they are sinners are the ones He came to make whole (Luke 8:48). How did Daniel and Paul view themselves? “We have sinned, and have committed iniquity, and have done wickedly, and have rebelled, even by departing from thy precepts and from thy judgments.” —Daniel 9:5 “O Lord, righteousness belongeth unto thee, but unto us confusion of faces, as at this day; to the men of Judah, and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and unto all Israel, that are near, and that are far off, through all the countries whither thou hast driven them, because of their trespass that they have trespassed against thee.” —Daniel 9:7 “O my God, incline thine ear, and hear; open thine eyes, and behold our desolations, and the city which is called by thy name: for we do not present our supplications before thee for our righteousnesses, but for thy great mercies.” —Daniel 9:18 “This is a faithful saying, and worthy of all acceptation, that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners; of whom I am chief.” —1 Timothy 1:15 Daniel, after a lifetime of following God, included himself in the sins of his people when praying for God’s forgiveness. He did not say, “They have sinned,” but, “We have sinned.” Likewise, Paul, after many fruitful years of preaching, teaching, and building up the early church, did not hesitate to call himself the chief of sinners. He could have said, “Of whom I was chief,” but he said, “Of whom I am chief.” Today, there is so much emphasis on our identity as sons and daughters of God that calling oneself a sinner is almost viewed as heresy or a perversion of the gospel, but Paul and Daniel would beg to differ. It is true that in Christ we are children of God, but let us not forget who we are apart from Christ, so we never lose sight of our need to continually cling to Him (1 Corinthians 10:12); otherwise, we risk adopting the Pharisaic mindset—that being God’s children we no longer have a need of repentance (1 John 5:8). Anything else on heart posture? “And this is the confidence that we have in him, that, if we ask any thing according to his will, he heareth us: And if we know that he hear us, whatsoever we ask, we know that we have the petitions that we desired of him.” —1 John 5:14-15 “And he went a little further, and fell on his face, and prayed, saying, O my Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me: nevertheless not as I will, but as thou wilt.” —Matthew 26:39 “And whatsoever we ask, we receive of him, because we keep his commandments, and do those things that are pleasing in his sight.” —1 John 3:22 “If I regard iniquity in my heart, the Lord will not hear me.” —Psalm 66:18 It’s crucial to be fully surrendered to His will for our prayers to be effective. If there is anything in our lives that is out of harmony with His will—any sin He has convicted us about—it’s crucial that we humble ourselves, repent, and forsake it. If the desire to do this is lacking, we can ask Him to give it to us (Acts 5:31; Philippians 2:13). The unconverted human heart is naturally drawn to sin, so it is God alone who can give us a hatred for it (Genesis 3:15). Willful rebellion is so serious that, according to Proverbs 28:9, it makes one’s prayer an abomination to God. Paul echoes this sentiment when he says that God will not be mocked (Galatians 6:7), for He sees our hearts and knows when we are harboring willful hypocrisy or pretense toward Him. God will never force His will upon us, which is why surrender begins with the willingness to follow His will. It’s a choice we consciously make, giving Him permission to activate His will and power in our lives. What should be the focus of prayer? “But seek ye first the kingdom of God, and his righteousness; and all these things shall be added unto you.” —Matthew 6:33 “After this manner therefore pray ye: Our Father which art in heaven, Hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done in earth, as it is in heaven.” —Matthew 6:9-10 It is easy for our prayers to become self-focused and selfish, but Christ teaches us to seek first His kingdom and His righteousness. This is later reinforced in His model prayer: “Hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done.” Below are some difficult—but necessary—questions we can ask to help us understand where we stand: 1. Is my primary focus on bringing glory and honor to His holy name rather than my own? 1. Am I preparing for and investing in His kingdom of righteousness—which, by the way, starts in our hearts now (Luke 17:20-21)—or am I more concerned with expanding my own personal, earthly empire? 1. Am I seeking His will in my daily life, or am I pursuing my own wants and desires above all else? One author shared the following insight on praying Jesus’ model prayer: “I cannot say ‘our’ if I live only for myself. I cannot say ‘Father’ if I do not endeavor each day to act like his child. I cannot say ‘who art in heaven’ if I’m laying up no treasures there. I cannot say ‘hallowed be thy name’ if I am not striving for holiness. I cannot say ‘thy kingdom come’ if I’m not seeking to hasten the blessed hope. I cannot say ‘thy will be done’ if I am disobedient to his word. I cannot say ‘in earth as it is in heaven’ if I’ll not serve him here and now. I cannot say ‘give us this day our daily bread’ if I am selfishly hoarding for the future. I cannot say ‘forgive us our debts’ if I harbor a grudge against anyone. I cannot say ‘lead us not into temptation’ if I deliberately place myself in its path. I cannot say ‘deliver us from evil’ if I do not long for holiness. I cannot say ‘thine is the kingdom’ if I do not give Jesus the throne of my heart. I cannot attribute to him ‘the power’ if I fear what men may do. I cannot ascribe to him ‘the glory’ if I’m seeking for my own honor. I cannot say ‘forever’ if I’m living only for temporary earthly rewards.” —Anonymous Quoted in Doug Batchelor, Teach Us to Pray, 30 (2005). What things can I pray about? “Casting all your care upon him; for he careth for you.” —1 Peter 5:7 “Cast thy burden upon the LORD, and he shall sustain thee: He shall never suffer the righteous to be moved.” —Psalm 55:22 “Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest.” —Matthew 11:28 Besides praying for His glory, His kingdom, and His will, God also cares about our personal lives and invites us to bring to Him anything that causes worry, trouble, or heaviness in our hearts. He is our loving heavenly Father who is deeply interested in the burdens we carry, and He wants to help! What about intercessory prayer? “Praying always with all prayer and supplication in the Spirit, and watching thereunto with all perseverance and supplication for all saints.” —Ephesians 6:18 “I exhort therefore, that, first of all, supplications, prayers, intercessions, and giving of thanks, be made for all men; for kings, and for all that are in authority; that we may lead a quiet and peaceable life in all godliness and honesty. For this is good and acceptable in the sight of God our Saviour.” —1 Timothy 2:1-3 “And the Lord said, Simon, Simon, behold, Satan hath desired to have you, that he may sift you as wheat: but I have prayed for thee, that thy faith fail not: and when thou art converted, strengthen thy brethren.” —Luke 22:31,32 Praying for others is another crucial part of our prayer life. When we pray for someone else, God receives the legal right to work in that person’s life—a right He might not otherwise have if we had not prayed. Why is this? Since God values each person’s freedom of choice, He does not work against someone’s will, especially if that person is resistant to Him, but when another person begins interceding, it changes everything. It opens the door for God to work in the resistant person’s life out of respect for the intercessor’s prayer. Intercessory prayer, however, is not limited to those who are resistant to God. Jesus prayed for Peter—one of His own disciples—because He saw a blind spot in Peter’s life that Peter was unaware of. Moses prayed for the Israelites (Numbers 21:7) and for his brother Aaron (Deuteronomy 9:20), and Job prayed for his friends (Job 42:10). Just as Jesus intercedes for us in the heavenly sanctuary (Hebrews 7:25), we, as His followers, are called to intercede for others. What does intercession require? “Praying always with all prayer and supplication in the Spirit, and watching thereunto with all perseverance and supplication for all saints.” —Ephesians 6:18 “And he spake a parable unto them to this end, that men ought always to pray, and not to faint.” —Luke 18:1 “Pray without ceasing.” —1 Thessalonians 5:17 “Now she that is a widow indeed, and desolate, trusteth in God, and continueth in supplications and prayers night and day. But she that liveth in pleasure is dead while she liveth.” —1 Timothy 5:5-6 Praying for others often involves asking God for a change of heart, and this usually takes time. God honors everyone’s free will, but He also honors the prayers of others, so even if a person resists Him initially, there is still hope, as long as those praying are willing to persevere and be patient. It may take years—or even decades—for a change of heart to take place, but that is nothing compared with eternity. All good things take time and effort, and prayer is no different. Rushed prayers often lack power because they don’t mean much to us, but prayers that produce results take time and effort. It would be wise for us to preface every important decision or action in our lives with much prayer. Jesus Himself sometimes prayed all night, such as before ordaining the twelve apostles (Luke 6:12-13). As our prayer life develops, spending time communing with our Father becomes a delight, no matter how long it takes. What is the first step to effective prayer? “Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and ye shall find; knock, and it shall be opened unto you. For every one that asketh receiveth; and he that seeketh findeth; and to him that knocketh it shall be opened.” —Matthew 7:7-8 This might seem obvious, but simply bringing our request to God—asking Him to be involved in resolving it—is the first step toward effective prayer. God is a Gentleman (Revelation 3:20); He will not involve Himself where He is not desired or welcomed. He respects our free will too much to force His way into our lives without our permission. By the way, the best things to ask for are those that are in harmony with His will as revealed in His Word. If we can find a verse in the Bible showing that our request aligns with His will, we can have confidence that we are on the right track. What is the second step? “And Jesus answering saith unto them, Have faith in God. For verily I say unto you, That whosoever shall say unto this mountain, Be thou removed, and be thou cast into the sea; and shall not doubt in his heart, but shall believe that those things which he saith shall come to pass; he shall have whatsoever he saith. Therefore I say unto you, What things soever ye desire, when ye pray, believe that ye receive them, and ye shall have them.” —Mark 11:22-24 Faith is the hand that reaches out to God, taking Him at His word. One of the many ways God is different from us is that His word has creative power to accomplish what He pleases (Isaiah 55:11). When we speak, our words have no power to create something out of nothing, but when God speaks, things happen (Genesis 1:3); if He has promised something, we can count on Him to keep that promise (Numbers 23:19)—and there is a promise in the Bible for all of our needs. But what if our faith is weak? The Bible tells us that: 1. God has given every person a measure of faith (Romans 12:3). 1. We can ask Him to increase our faith (Mark 9:24), and He will likely give us opportunities to exercise it. 1. Faith comes by hearing, and hearing by the Word of God (Romans 10:17). In other words, we grow in faith as we get to know Him more through the study of His Word and through prayer. So why is faith so important to God? Well, it is the foundation of our relationship with Him. There is nothing more pleasing to a father than a child coming to him in confidence, full of trust in his love and power. Our heavenly Father delights when we come to Him in prayer, trusting that He will hear and answer our requests in His time and way. What is the third step? “Then they took away the stone from the place where the dead was laid. And Jesus lifted up his eyes, and said, Father, I thank thee that thou hast heard me. And I knew that thou hearest me always: but because of the people which stand by I said it, that they may believe that thou hast sent me. And when he thus had spoken, he cried with a loud voice, Lazarus, come forth. And he that was dead came forth …” —John 11:41-44 “And when he had consulted with the people, he appointed singers unto the LORD, and that should praise the beauty of holiness, as they went out before the army, and to say, Praise the LORD; for his mercy endureth for ever. And when they began to sing and to praise, the LORD set ambushments against the children of Ammon, Moab, and mount Seir, which were come against Judah; and they were smitten.” —2 Chronicles 20:21-22 When Jesus raised Lazarus, He thanked God for hearing His prayer before the resurrection occurred. Likewise, when the Israelites went to war under Jehoshaphat, they praised God before the battle even began. Thanking God before we receive His answer is closely related to the concept we just discussed—faith; it is further evidence of a trusting confidence in His love. It is natural to give thanks for something already received, but giving thanks in advance requires faith. However, if we know our request is in harmony with His will, as revealed in the Bible, we can be confident that He will answer it. Knowing God’s will for us requires Bible study, but there is power in finding a promise in His Word that pertains to our request, presenting it to Him in prayer, and then claiming it—in the name of His beloved Son—by faith, and thanking Him for it. In Jesus, all of God’s promises are sure (2 Corinthians 1:20). Obviously, how and when God answers our prayers is up to Him. He may say “Yes,” or He may say “Wait” if the timing is not quite right, thereby giving us a chance to practice patience. “No” is a perfectly legitimate answer too, even though it may not be what we wanted. In such cases, we can rest in the assurance that He sees the end from the beginning and always has our best interests in mind—knowing what is best for us better than we do ourselves. The three parts of an effective prayer can be easily remembered with the ABC acronym: Ask (A), Believe (B), and Claim (C). Author Glen Coon expounds on these in greater detail in his book The ABCs of Bible Prayer. Why do we pray in Jesus’ name? “And whatsoever ye shall ask in my name, that will I do, that the Father may be glorified in the Son. If ye shall ask any thing in my name, I will do it.” —John 14:13,14 “Ye have not chosen me, but I have chosen you, and ordained you, that ye should go and bring forth fruit, and that your fruit should remain: that whatsoever ye shall ask of the Father in my name, he may give it you.” —John 15:16 “And in that day ye shall ask me nothing. Verily, verily, I say unto you, Whatsoever ye shall ask the Father in my name, he will give it you. Hitherto have ye asked nothing in my name: ask, and ye shall receive, that your joy may be full.” —John 16:23,24 In Adam and Eve’s rejection of God in the garden, the human race separated itself from its Maker, but God immediately promised that, in His Son Jesus, He would provide them, and anyone who desired it, a path to reconciliation (Genesis 3:15). This promise was later illustrated to Jacob in the dream of a ladder, symbolizing Jesus, that united heaven and earth (Genesis 28:12). Adam and Eve’s rejection is replayed in the life of every person, for all have sinned (Romans 3:23). Apart from Christ—who alone lived a perfect life and offered it on the cross to pay for our sins—we have nothing to commend us to God. Our sins have made us unworthy of our Father (Luke 15:21), but Jesus has given us a second chance! When we pray in His name, we are enabled to “come boldly unto the throne of grace, that we may obtain mercy, and find grace to help in time of need” (Hebrews 4:16) because, when we accept Him as our Redeemer and Lord, He covers the shame of our sins with His perfect righteousness (Isaiah 61:10), and God calls us His children once more (1 John 3:1)! How important is gratitude? “And let the peace of God rule in your hearts, to the which also ye are called in one body; and be ye thankful. Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly in all wisdom; teaching and admonishing one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing with grace in your hearts to the Lord. And whatsoever ye do in word or deed, do all in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God and the Father by him.” —Colossians 3:15-17 “Continue in prayer, and watch in the same with thanksgiving.” —Colossians 4:2 “I thank my God upon every remembrance of you, always in every prayer of mine for you all making request with joy.” —Philippians 1:3-4 “In every thing give thanks: for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus concerning you.” —1 Thessalonians. 5:18 The Bible teaches that every good thing comes from our Father (James 1:17), so praise, gratitude, and thanksgiving have a place in every prayer. There will be circumstances in which these may be harder to express, but Paul tells us that “all things work together for good to those who love God” (Romans 8:28). Note that he doesn’t say “some things” or “most things,” but “all.” This means that God will use even the greatest tragedy for good—just look at the cross, where Jesus hung, rejected and crucified by the very people He came to save. Nothing we will ever experience comes close to what He endured on the cross. He took the sword first and blunted its edge for us. What is the purpose of prayer? “Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done in earth, as it is in heaven.” —Matthew 6:10 “Let this mind be in you, which was also in Christ Jesus.” —Philippians 2:5 “That he would grant you, according to the riches of his glory, to be strengthened with might by his Spirit in the inner man; that Christ may dwell in your hearts by faith; that ye, being rooted and grounded in love, may be able to comprehend with all saints what is the breadth, and length, and depth, and height; and to know the love of Christ, which passeth knowledge, that ye might be filled with all the fulness of God.” —Ephesians 3:16-19 “Behold, I stand at the door, and knock: if any man hear my voice, and open the door, I will come in to him, and will sup with him, and he with me.” —Revelation 3:20 Prayer leads us into harmony with the mind of Jesus and into deeper fellowship with Him. It is said that we are the sum of the people we spend the most time with because we often begin to imitate them. Prayer, along with Bible study, is how we spend time with Jesus. Bible study is how He speaks to us, and prayer is how we speak to Him. Without daily, quality time, every relationship will eventually fall apart—including our relationship with Christ. Does prayer help resist temptation? “Watch ye and pray, lest ye enter into temptation. The spirit truly is ready, but the flesh is weak.” —Mark 14:38 “Take ye heed, watch and pray: for ye know not when the time is.” —Mark 13:33 “Watch ye therefore, and pray always, that ye may be accounted worthy to escape all these things that shall come to pass, and to stand before the Son of man.” —Luke 21:36 “But the end of all things is at hand: be ye therefore sober, and watch unto prayer.” —1 Peter 4:7 When we are tempted, the last thing we often want to do is pray, but connecting with God in that crucial moment is key, and it’s best to continue praying until the temptation passes. As long as we hold on to God, we cannot be overcome. Praying before the temptation comes, as demonstrated in Jesus’ model prayer, is also wise: “and lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil” (Matthew 6:13). If we are willing to be vigilant and avoid situations we know will tempt us, God will do His part to help us. The good news is there is a way of escape from every temptation, as God will never allow us to be tempted beyond what we are able to bear (1 Corinthians 10:13). Had Jesus’ disciples heeded His call to watch and pray in Gethsemane, there is no doubt they would have been strengthened to better endure what was about to come upon both Him and them. And poor Peter—would he have denied his Lord if he had spent that time in prayer instead of sleeping? Does prayer enable laziness? “Give us this day our daily bread.” —Matthew 6:11 “And when the dew that lay was gone up, behold, upon the face of the wilderness there lay a small round thing, as small as the hoar frost on the ground. And when the children of Israel saw it, they said one to another, It is manna: for they wist not what it was. And Moses said unto them, This is the bread which the LORD hath given you to eat. This is the thing which the LORD hath commanded, Gather of it every man according to his eating, an omer for every man, according to the number of your persons; take ye every man for them which are in his tents.” —Exodus 16:14-16 When God provided manna for the Israelites, it didn’t simply fall into their mouths; they still had to go out and gather it. God wants us to cooperate with Him by investing ourselves in the process; otherwise, we risk becoming lazy with His blessings. The simple truth is that He will never do for us what we can do for ourselves, but once we have done our part, He will do what we cannot. Where should I pray? “But you, when you pray, go into your room, and when you have shut your door, pray to your Father who is in the secret place; and your Father who sees in secret will reward you openly.” —Matthew 6:6, NKJV “And in the morning, rising up a great while before day, he went out, and departed into a solitary place, and there prayed.” —Mark 1:35 The best places for prayer are quiet and free from distractions, allowing us to focus fully on communing with our heavenly Father. In contrast, the Pharisees of Jesus’ day loved to pray publicly in order to be seen by others, but Christ calls us to seek Him humbly and in private. Of course, there is a time and place for corporate prayer—such as a church service or a small group—but our personal prayers should be between us and God alone. Should my prayers be repetitive? “But when ye pray, use not vain repetitions, as the heathen do: for they think that they shall be heard for their much speaking.” —Matthew 6:7 “And ye shall seek me, and find me, when ye shall search for me with all your heart.” —Jeremiah 29:13 “Confess your faults one to another, and pray one for another, that ye may be healed. The effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man availeth much.” —James 5:16 Jesus associated the repetition of words and phrases with paganism (Acts 19:34; 1 Kings 18:26), thereby making it clear that such practices have no place in the life of a Christian. The same is true of “breath prayers” and the popular practice of “entering the silence,” which often involves emptying the mind—disengaging the reasoning faculties—which is one of the quickest ways to enter an altered state of consciousness. Such practices often lead to mysticism and can open the door to the influence of malevolent spiritual powers. (For more information, see Howard Peth’s book The Dangers of Contemplative Prayer.) God desires that we be fully engaged when we speak with Him—just as we would be when talking to a close friend—with our minds alert and our reasoning intact (Isaiah 1:18). Prayer should be fresh, fervent, and from the heart. If our hearts are not in it, we probably should not be praying it. Prayers that do not mean much to us are unlikely to mean much to God. Is praying aloud a good idea? “Then they took away the stone from the place where the dead was laid. And Jesus lifted up his eyes, and said, Father, I thank thee that thou hast heard me. And I knew that thou hearest me always: but because of the people which stand by I said it, that they may believe that thou hast sent me.” —John 11:41 “And he went a little further, and fell on his face, and prayed, saying, O my Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me: nevertheless not as I will, but as thou wilt.” —Matthew 26:39 “And at midnight Paul and Silas prayed, and sang praises unto God: and the prisoners heard them.” —Acts 16:25 Jesus often prayed aloud, even in His personal prayers; otherwise, His disciples would not have heard them and recorded them for us. Paul and Silas also prayed aloud after they were imprisoned, and their witness for God led to the jailer’s conversion (Acts 16:29-30). Even in private, personal prayers between us and God, praying audibly can be helpful because it keeps us more focused and engaged. However, we should be careful to maintain our privacy in these moments, ensuring that only God hears us. What is the PRAY acronym? PRAY is an easy-to-remember acronym that can bring structure to our prayers. It stands for: - Praise - acknowledging God’s goodness. - Repent - confessing sins He has convicted us about. - Ask - presenting our requests to Him and interceding for others. - Yield - surrendering ourselves to Him in faith—our will, mind, heart, body, plans, abilities, and resources. Should I document God’s answers? “And thou shalt remember all the way which the LORD thy God led thee these forty years in the wilderness, to humble thee, and to prove thee, to know what was in thine heart, whether thou wouldest keep his commandments, or no.” —Deuteronomy 8:2 “Remember his marvellous works that he hath done, His wonders, and the judgments of his mouth.” —1 Chronicles 16:12 Because it’s easy to forget how God has answered our prayers in the past, it’s wise to write them down and revisit them from time to time. Rehearsing His blessings will do wonders to strengthen our faith in Him.\",\"series\":\"The Christian Life\"},\"10\":{\"title\":\"God’s Holy Rest Day\",\"url\":\"/basics/sabbath/\",\"category\":\"Basics\",\"description\":\"A day was set apart by God on the first week of creation. Why? Does it still have significance today?\",\"body\":\"What is the first angel’s message in Revelation 14? “And I saw another angel fly in the midst of heaven, having the everlasting gospel to preach unto them that dwell on the earth, and to every nation, and kindred, and tongue, and people, saying with a loud voice, Fear God, and give glory to him; for the hour of his judgment is come: and worship him that made heaven, and earth, and the sea, and the fountains of waters.” —Revelation 14:6-7 In Revelation 14 there are three angels proclaiming a message to the people of the world in the last days, and the first angel’s message is a call to worship the Creator God and give glory to Him. What is it an echo of? “You are worthy, O Lord, to receive glory and honor and power; for You created all things, and by Your will they exist and were created.” —Revelation 4:11, NKJV Revelation 14:6-7 is an echo of the verse above, which explains that God is worthy to receive glory, honor, and power because He is the Author of all life. How did God create? “And to make all men see what is the fellowship of the mystery, which from the beginning of the world hath been hid in God, who created all things by Jesus Christ.” —Ephesians 3:9 “For by him [Jesus] were all things created, that are in heaven, and that are in earth, visible and invisible, whether they be thrones, or dominions, or principalities, or powers: all things were created by him, and for him: and he is before all things, and by him all things consist.” —Colossians 1:16-17 God the Father created all things by His Son Jesus, who was fulfilling the will of His Father, and by Him it all consists and holds together! Which commandment identifies the Creator God? “Remember the sabbath day, to keep it holy. Six days shalt thou labour, and do all thy work: but the seventh day is the sabbath of the LORD thy God: in it thou shalt not do any work, thou, nor thy son, nor thy daughter, thy manservant, nor thy maidservant, nor thy cattle, nor thy stranger that is within thy gates: for in six days the LORD made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that in them is, and rested the seventh day: wherefore the LORD blessed the sabbath day, and hallowed it.” —Exodus 20:8-11 The fourth commandment begins with the word “remember” because God knew His Sabbath would be forgotten. It then identifies Him as the Creator of all things, thus providing the reason He has a claim to our worship, which all who rest on the Sabbath day acknowledge. The Sabbath commandment also contains the three basic elements of a seal: name (“the Lord”), title (“your God”), and territory (“heaven and earth”). This uniquely identifies God as the author of the other nine commandments and establishes His authority. In other words, the authority of the Decalogue rests on the fourth commandment; without it, anyone could claim authorship of the other nine. What else can I learn about the Sabbath from Genesis 2? “Thus the heavens and the earth were finished, and all the host of them. And on the seventh day God ended his work which he had made; and he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had made. And God blessed the seventh day, and sanctified it: because that in it he had rested from all his work which God created and made.” —Genesis 2:1-3 The reason why the fourth commandment invites me to keep the Sabbath day holy is because God blessed this specific day and sanctified it. The word used in the original text is qadash, which means “to be set apart or consecrated.” In other words, the seventh day, is special to God and unlike any of the other six days of the week. Who is the Sabbath really for? “And he said unto them, The sabbath was made for man, and not man for the sabbath: therefore the Son of man is Lord also of the sabbath.” —Mark 2:27-28 “For thus saith the LORD unto the eunuchs that keep my sabbaths, and choose the things that please me, and take hold of my covenant; rven unto them will I give in mine house and within my walls a place and a name better than of sons and of daughters: I will give them an everlasting name, that shall not be cut off. Also the sons of the stranger, that join themselves to the LORD, to serve him, and to love the name of the LORD, to be his servants, every one that keepeth the sabbath from polluting it, and taketh hold of my covenant; even them will I bring to my holy mountain, and make them joyful in my house of prayer: their burnt offerings and their sacrifices shall be accepted upon mine altar; for mine house shall be called an house of prayer for all people.” —Isaiah 56:4-7 The Sabbath was made for all humanity. When God established the Sabbath, He did not need the rest it provided, for He does not grow weary (Isaiah 40:28). Nor had He labored in the way we do, since apart from forming Adam and Eve, His creative acts were accomplished simply by speaking. But humanity does grow weary from labor and therefore needs the rest the Sabbath provides. This is affirmed in the Old Testament, for Isaiah declares that the Sabbath was not only for the Israelites but also for the “strangers”—outsiders—who chose to “join themselves to the Lord.” Jesus, the Creator and Lord of the Sabbath, confirmed this same truth in the New Testament when He declared, “The Sabbath was made for man.” He could have said “for the Jews,” but He did not. Therefore, the commonly used expression “Jewish Sabbath” reflects either genuine ignorance or a serious misunderstanding of Scripture. Why was it given to us? “Moreover also I gave them my sabbaths, to be a sign between me and them, that they might know that I am the LORD that sanctify them. … And hallow my sabbaths; and they shall be a sign between me and you, that ye may know that I am the LORD your God.” —Ezekiel 20:12, 20 “And remember that thou wast a servant in the land of Egypt, and that the LORD thy God brought thee out thence through a mighty hand and by a stretched out arm: therefore the LORD thy God commanded thee to keep the sabbath day.” —Deuteronomy 5:15 The Sabbath is a sign of my acknowledgment that: 1. God is Lord because He created this world in six consecutive, literal, 24-hour days (Exodus 20:8, 11). The Sabbath is a weekly reminder that I have a Creator who desires to have a relationship with me. This truth carries several important implications: I am not self-created; I am not a god, nor can I become one; I possess no inherent divinity—no inner godhood or divine spark; I do not have an immortal soul, for only God is immortal (1 Timothy 6:15-16); and I did not come into existence by accident or through a long process of evolution. My life has meaning and purpose. 2. God is Lord of my life because He is the One who redeems and sanctifies me. In the Bible, the Israelites’ bondage in Egypt symbolizes the spiritual bondage of sin from which God delivers me. Therefore, the Sabbath is a weekly reminder that, in Jesus, victory over sin is available to all. After all, Jesus would not have told the woman caught in adultery to “go and sin no more” if that were impossible (John 8:11). Moreover, the Sabbath is a sign that I am not saved by my own works, but by faith in His completed work on the cross, as well as His ongoing work as my Intercessor in the heavenly sanctuary. In Eden, God rested on the seventh day from His work of creation, and in the tomb, Jesus rested on the same day from His work of redemption. Therefore, the Sabbath serves as a memorial of both acts. It is a weekly rest in Jesus, during which I set aside my secular work and worldly duties to connect with and honor Him—no matter how busy life may become. Did Jesus keep the Sabbath? “And he came to Nazareth, where he had been brought up: and, as his custom was, he went into the synagogue on the sabbath day, and stood up for to read.” —Luke 4:16 “And came down to Capernaum, a city of Galilee, and taught them on the sabbath days.” —Luke 4:31 “And they went into Capernaum; and straightway on the sabbath day he entered into the synagogue, and taught.” —Mark 1:21 “And when the sabbath day was come, he began to teach in the synagogue: and many hearing him were astonished, saying, From whence hath this man these things? and what wisdom is this which is given unto him, that even such mighty works are wrought by his hands?” —Mark 6:2 Luke tells us that going to the synagogue on the Sabbath day was a habit, not just an occasional occurrence, for Jesus. Did His followers keep it? “And that day was the preparation, and the sabbath drew on. And the women also, which came with him from Galilee, followed after, and beheld the sepulchre, and how his body was laid. And they returned, and prepared spices and ointments; and rested the sabbath day according to the commandment.” —Luke 23:54-56 “Now upon the first day of the week, very early in the morning, they came unto the sepulchre, bringing the spices which they had prepared, and certain others with them.” —Luke 24:1 The Bible is clear that His followers kept the Sabbath. In fact, they even stopped their work of anointing His body in order to keep it according to the commandment. They ended up coming back on Sunday, the first day of the week, after the Sabbath was over, to finish their work. Did Jesus expect it to be kept after His resurrection? “But pray ye that your flight be not in the winter, neither on the sabbath day.” —Matthew 24:20 Jesus warned about the destruction of Jerusalem by Rome, which occured in A.D. 70, and made it clear that the Sabbath would be kept long after His resurrection. Did His followers keep it after His resurrection? “And he reasoned in the synagogue every sabbath, and persuaded the Jews and the Greeks.” —Acts 18:4 “And when the Jews were gone out of the synagogue, the Gentiles besought that these words might be preached to them the next sabbath. Now when the congregation was broken up, many of the Jews and religious proselytes followed Paul and Barnabas: who, speaking to them, persuaded them to continue in the grace of God. And the next sabbath day came almost the whole city together to hear the word of God.” —Acts 13:42-44 “And Paul, as his manner was, went in unto them, and three sabbath days reasoned with them out of the scriptures.” —Acts 17:2 “But when they departed from Perga, they came to Antioch in Pisidia, and went into the synagogue on the Sabbath day, and sat down.” —Acts 13:14 Christ’s apostles kept the Sabbath themselves and taught others to do the same, including the converted Gentiles. On what day was John, the Revelator, in the Spirit? “I was in the Spirit on the Lord’s day, and heard behind me a great voice, as of a trumpet.” —Revelation 1:10 What is the Lord’s Day? “For the Son of man is Lord even of the sabbath day.” —Matthew 12:8 “And hallow my sabbaths; and they shall be a sign between me and you, that ye may know that I am the LORD your God.” —Ezekiel 20:20 “Speak thou also unto the children of Israel, saying, Verily my sabbaths ye shall keep: for it is a sign between me and you throughout your generations; that ye may know that I am the LORD that doth sanctify you.” —Exodus 31:13 God is Lord of the Sabbath, the seventh day (Exodus 20:11). Notice that He calls these days “My Sabbaths,” meaning it is His special day, which He blessed and sanctified to be a sign between Him and His people of His creative, redeeming, and sanctifying power. Does God change His ways? “Jesus Christ the same yesterday, and to day, and for ever.” —Hebrews 13:8 “Every good gift and every perfect gift is from above, and cometh down from the Father of lights, with whom is no variableness, neither shadow of turning.” —James 1:17 “My covenant will I not break, nor alter the thing that is gone out of my lips.” —Psalm 89:34 “And it is easier for heaven and earth to pass, than one tittle of the law to fail.” —Luke 16:17 “Heaven and earth shall pass away: but my words shall not pass away.” —Luke 21:33 God is not a fallible man who makes mistakes, changes His mind, or alters His commandments. The Decalogue is a transcript of His character and, as such, it can never be altered, which is good news, because it means His righteous and loving character will never change! Although some have claimed that His commandments have been altered—and the Bible predicted such attempts—the truth remains that His commandments are unchangeable. Will the Sabbath be kept in heaven? “For as the new heavens and the new earth, which I will make, shall remain before me, saith the LORD, so shall your seed and your name remain. And it shall come to pass, that from one new moon to another, and from one sabbath to another, shall all flesh come to worship before me, saith the LORD.” —Isaiah 66:22-23 The Sabbath will continue to be kept in heaven as a beautiful weekly testament to God’s power to fully redeem fallen humanity from a world of sin and to sanctify them for a new life in heaven. In heaven, it will also take on a new dimension as a memorial of His power to redeem the world itself from the curse of sin after He recreates it anew!\",\"series\":\"The Bible Sabbath\"},\"11\":{\"title\":\"The Holy Spirit\",\"url\":\"/basics/spirit/\",\"category\":\"Basics\",\"description\":\"He might be the least understood member of the Godhead, but He plays a crucial role in every person’s salvation.\",\"body\":\"Is the Holy Spirit part of the Godhead? “Go ye therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost: teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you: and, lo, I am with you alway, even unto the end of the world. Amen.” —Matthew 28:19-20 “The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the communion of the Holy Ghost, be with you all.” —2 Corinthians 13:14 The Holy Spirit is part of the Godhead, also referred to as the Trinity, that consists of three distinct Persons: the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. These three Persons are united in perfect harmony as one God (Isaiah 46:9). In the Old Testament there are multiple instances where this unity in plurality is shown (Genesis 1:26; 3:22; 11:7; Isaiah 6:8). Another example is Jesus’ baptism, when all three members of the Godhead were present: the Son of God was baptized, the Father spoke, and the Holy Spirit descended (Matthew 3:16-17). Is the Holy Spirit a person? “But Peter said, Ananias, why hath Satan filled thine heart to lie to the Holy Ghost, and to keep back part of the price of the land? Whiles it remained, was it not thine own? and after it was sold, was it not in thine own power? why hast thou conceived this thing in thine heart? thou hast not lied unto men, but unto God.” —Acts 5:3-4 “Howbeit when he, the Spirit of truth, is come, he will guide you into all truth: for he shall not speak of himself; but whatsoever he shall hear, that shall he speak: and he will shew you things to come.” —John 16:13 “And he that searcheth the hearts knoweth what is the mind of the Spirit, because he maketh intercession for the saints according to the will of God.” —Romans 8:27 Peter made it clear that the Holy Spirit is not only God, but He can also be lied to, which means He’s a Person with a personality, not an impersonal “force.” Paul confirmed this when he stated that the Spirit has a mind. Jesus, also, referred to the Spirit as “He”—an individual Being who works in harmony with the Godhead. What did Jesus promise before His ascension? “Nevertheless I tell you the truth; It is expedient for you that I go away: for if I go not away, the Comforter will not come unto you; but if I depart, I will send him unto you.” —John 16:7 “And I will pray the Father, and he shall give you another Comforter, that he may abide with you for ever. Even the Spirit of truth; whom the world cannot receive, because it seeth him not, neither knoweth him: but ye know him; for he dwelleth with you, and shall be in you. I will not leave you comfortless: I will come to you.” —John 14:16-17 “And he that keepeth his commandments dwelleth in him, and he in him. And hereby we know that he abideth in us, by the Spirit which he hath given us.” —1 John 3:24 Jesus promised that after His ascension He would send us the Comforter, the Holy Spirit, who’s abiding presence would comfort us. Notice also that when Jesus said the Holy Spirit would dwell in us, He followed that up with “I will come to you,” meaning Jesus equates the presence of the Spirit with His own presence! He Himself lives and abides in us through the Holy Spirit. When Jesus was on earth, people wanting to be with Him had to physically seek Him out, but we no longer have these limitations! Jesus can be anywhere and with anyone through the Person of the Holy Spirit. What is the Holy Spirit’s role? “Howbeit when he, the Spirit of truth, is come, he will guide you into all truth: for he shall not speak of himself; but whatsoever he shall hear, that shall he speak: and he will shew you things to come. He shall glorify me: for he shall receive of mine, and shall shew it unto you.” —John 16:13-14 “But the Comforter, which is the Holy Ghost, whom the Father will send in my name, he shall teach you all things, and bring all things to your remembrance, whatsoever I have said unto you.” —John 14:26 “Now we have received, not the spirit of the world, but the spirit which is of God; that we might know the things that are freely given to us of God. Which things also we speak, not in the words which man’s wisdom teacheth, but which the Holy Ghost teacheth; comparing spiritual things with spiritual. But the natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God: for they are foolishness unto him: neither can he know them, because they are spiritually discerned.” —1 Corinthians 2:12-14 Paul tells us that spiritual things are spiritually discerned (1 Corinthians 2:14), so one of the roles of the Holy Spirit is to teach and guide those studying the Bible into an understanding of its beautiful, freely given, truths because the Bible was written under the inspiration of the Spirit (2 Timothy 3:16; 2 Peter 1:21). Without the aid of the Spirit, the Bible cannot be understood, which is why it’s crucial to pray for the Holy Spirit’s guidance whenever we read it. Notice also that John says the Spirit does not speak independently of Jesus; on the contrary, He’s in harmony with the teachings of Jesus, working to give us an understanding of them. What else does the Spirit do? “And when he is come, he will reprove the world of sin, and of righteousness, and of judgment.” —John 16:8 “But when the Comforter is come, whom I will send unto you from the Father, even the Spirit of truth, which proceedeth from the Father, he shall testify of me.” —John 15:26 “Likewise the Spirit also helpeth our infirmities: for we know not what we should pray for as we ought: but the Spirit itself maketh intercession for us with groanings which cannot be uttered. And he that searcheth the hearts knoweth what is the mind of the Spirit, because he maketh intercession for the saints according to the will of God.” —Romans 8:26-27 The Holy Spirit reproves, or brings conviction, of sin, of righteousness, and of judgment. In other words, He identifies what is right and wrong in the sight of God, enabling us to experience spiritual growth and an increased love of God, His righteousness, and holy living. Put simply, the Holy Spirit is the catalyst that brings power, victory, and life to the Christian walk. These life changes might seem impossible to us, but, if we are willing to cooperate with the Holy Spirit, nothing is impossible to God (Mark 10:26-27; Philippians 2:13). The Holy Spirit also testifies of Jesus, revealing His character and truth to us, which, if received, has the power to sanctify our own characters (John 14:6; 17:17). And whenever we pray, it’s the Holy Spirit who inspires our petitions, if we let Him, so that they are in accordance to God’s will. To what extent do I need the Spirit? “And be not drunk with wine, wherein is excess; but be filled with the Spirit.” —Ephesians 5:18 “For John truly baptized with water; but ye shall be baptized with the Holy Ghost not many days hence.” —Acts 1:5 God wants us to be filled, or baptized, with the Holy Spirit. The word “filled” can be translated as “to fill up,” indicating that it’s not just a partial filling. How do I receive the Holy Spirit? “If ye then, being evil, know how to give good gifts unto your children: how much more shall your heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to them that ask him?” —Luke 11:13 “Let this mind be in you, which was also in Christ Jesus.” —Philippians 2:5 All I need to do to receive the Holy Spirit is ask God for it! He wants to bestow the Holy Spirit on all, but He will not do it against anyone’s will, which is why I need to ask. Asking only comes after there’s been a realization of my need of the Spirit, which means there is a heart that’s surrendered to God, dead to self, willing to receive. Paul uses the word “let” to describe the process of receiving the mind of Christ, meaning there is a willingness to yield—to surrender—to the sanctifying work of the Holy Spirit. And it truly is His work, not ours, because we cannot change ourselves, but we must be willing to cooperate with Him. What happens when one is filled with the Spirit? “But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, longsuffering, gentleness, goodness, faith, meekness, temperance: against such there is no law. And they that are Christ’s have crucified the flesh with the affections and lusts. If we live in the Spirit, let us also walk in the Spirit. Let us not be desirous of vain glory, provoking one another, envying one another.” —Galatians 5:22-26 “This I say then, Walk in the Spirit, and ye shall not fulfil the lust of the flesh.” —Galatians 5:16 A life that is filled with the Holy Spirit will produce the fruits of the Spirit, which are the attributes of Jesus, while the carnal, selfish nature will be crucified, or surrendered, to Christ. Notice that these are the fruits of the Spirit, not our own fruits, because we cannot produce them ourselves. What does the Spirit have power to do? “And the earth was without form, and void; and darkness was upon the face of the deep. And the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters.” —Genesis 1:2 “A new heart also will I give you, and a new spirit will I put within you: and I will take away the stony heart out of your flesh, and I will give you an heart of flesh. And I will put my spirit within you, and cause you to walk in my statutes, and ye shall keep my judgments, and do them.” —Ezekiel 36:26-27 “Not by works of righteousness which we have done, but according to his mercy he saved us, by the washing of regeneration, and renewing of the Holy Ghost; which he shed on us abundantly through Jesus Christ our Saviour.” —Titus 3:5-6 “Jesus answered, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born of water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God. That which is born of the flesh is flesh; and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit. Marvel not that I said unto thee, Ye must be born again. The wind bloweth where it listeth [wishes], and thou hearest the sound thereof, but canst not tell whence it cometh, and whither it goeth: so is every one that is born of the Spirit.” —John 3:5-8 Just like the Holy Spirit participated in the work of creation on that first week, He participates in the work of recreating the heart, renewing the mind, and transforming the character after the likeness of Jesus. When the Holy Spirit dwells in us, He will give us a new heart, enabling us to keep God’s commandments and live a genuine, victorious, joyful Christian life. This transplant of the heart is what Jesus referred to when He told Nicodemus that no one can enter the kingdom of God unless born of the Spirit. Like the movement of the wind, the work of the Holy Spirit upon the heart is a mystery to us, but just like the movement of the wind is made evident by its sound, the work of the Spirit will be made evident by its fruits in a person’s life. What is the baptism of the Holy Spirit? “For John truly baptized with water; but ye shall be baptized with the Holy Ghost not many days hence.” —Acts 1:5 “And when the day of Pentecost was fully come, they were all with one accord in one place. And suddenly there came a sound from heaven as of a rushing mighty wind, and it filled all the house where they were sitting. And there appeared unto them cloven tongues like as of fire, and it sat upon each of them. And they were all filled with the Holy Ghost, and began to speak with other tongues, as the Spirit gave them utterance.” —Acts 2:1-4 “Then Peter said unto them, Repent, and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins, and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost.” —Acts 2:38 Jesus’ promise to send the Holy Spirit was fulfilled on the Day of Pentecost when the disciples were filled, or baptized, with the Spirit, receiving various supernatural gifts that enabled them to proclaim the gospel with power. Peter made it clear that God’s genuine followers today are also prepared for service through the same outpouring of the Holy Spirit (Ephesians 4:11-13) when they repent and are baptized. And just like the outpouring during Pentecost, there will be another outpouring of the Spirit in the last days, just before Christ’s return, that will enable God’s followers to preach the gospel with power and give the final warning to the world (Acts 3:19-21; Joel 2:28-29). Will the Spirit participate in the resurrection? “But if the Spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you, he that raised up Christ from the dead shall also quicken your mortal bodies by his Spirit that dwelleth in you.” —Romans 8:11 The Holy Spirit will participate in the resurrection of God’s faithful followers, just like He participated in the resurrection of Christ. If we are Christ’s, there is no need to fear death because Jesus, who conquered death, will resurrect His people through the power of the Holy Spirit at His second coming. What are the gifts of the Spirit? “Now there are diversities of gifts, but the same Spirit. And there are differences of administrations, but the same Lord. And there are diversities of operations, but it is the same God which worketh all in all. But the manifestation of the Spirit is given to every man to profit withal. ““For to one is given by the Spirit the word of wisdom; to another the word of knowledge by the same Spirit; to another faith by the same Spirit; to another the gifts of healing by the same Spirit; to another the working of miracles; to another prophecy; to another discerning of spirits; to another divers kinds of tongues; to another the interpretation of tongues: but all these worketh that one and the selfsame Spirit, dividing to every man severally [separately] as he will.” —1 Corinthians 12:4-11 “And he gave some, apostles; and some, prophets; and some, evangelists; and some, pastors and teachers; for the perfecting of the saints, for the work of the ministry, for the edifying of the body of Christ: till we all come in the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of God, unto a perfect man, unto the measure of the stature of the fulness of Christ.” —Ephesians 4:11-13 “Having then gifts differing according to the grace that is given to us, whether prophecy, let us prophesy according to the proportion of faith; or ministry, let us wait on our ministering: or he that teacheth, on teaching; or he that exhorteth, on exhortation: he that giveth, let him do it with simplicity; he that ruleth, with diligence; he that sheweth mercy, with cheerfulness.” —Romans 12:6-8 The Holy Spirit bestows various spiritual gifts on believers to edify the members of the church as well as to minister to those outside of the church. These can be obvious miraculous talents, but they also include already existing ones that the Spirit then develops. The Holy Spirit distributes these gifts as He wills, and every believer receives at least one. What does “speaking in tongues” mean? “And they were all filled with the Holy Ghost, and began to speak with other tongues, as the Spirit gave them utterance. And there were dwelling at Jerusalem Jews, devout men, out of every nation under heaven. Now when this was noised abroad, the multitude came together, and were confounded, because that every man heard them speak in his own language. ““And they were all amazed and marvelled, saying one to another, Behold, are not all these which speak Galilaeans? And how hear we every man in our own tongue, wherein we were born? Parthians, and Medes, and Elamites, and the dwellers in Mesopotamia, and in Judaea, and Cappadocia, in Pontus, and Asia, Phrygia, and Pamphylia, in Egypt, and in the parts of Libya about Cyrene, and strangers of Rome, Jews and proselytes, Cretes and Arabians, we do hear them speak in our tongues the wonderful works of God.” —Acts 2:4-11 “So likewise ye, except ye utter by the tongue words easy to be understood, how shall it be known what is spoken? for ye shall speak into the air. … Yet in the church I had rather speak five words with my understanding, that by my voice I might teach others also, than ten thousand words in an unknown tongue. … ““If any man speak in an unknown tongue, let it be by two, or at the most by three, and that by course; and let one interpret. But if there be no interpreter, let him keep silence in the church; and let him speak to himself, and to God. Let the prophets speak two or three, and let the other judge. If any thing be revealed to another that sitteth by, let the first hold his peace. For ye may all prophesy one by one, that all may learn, and all may be comforted. And the spirits of the prophets are subject to the prophets. For God is not the author of confusion, but of peace, as in all churches of the saints.” —1 Corinthians 14:9, 19, 27-33 “But ye shall receive power, after that the Holy Ghost is come upon you: and ye shall be witnesses unto me both in Jerusalem, and in all Judaea, and in Samaria, and unto the uttermost part of the earth.” —Acts 1:8 Jesus said that the gifts and the filling of the Holy Spirit are for the purpose of witnessing to other people. This was examplified at Pentacost because one of the gifts of the Spirit was an ability to speak other tongues, or languages, and since there were people present in Jerusalem from other nations, the gift was needed so that the gospel could be communicated without any language barriers. The book of Acts mentions tongues only three times (Acts 2:4-11; 10:44-46; 19:4-6), and the Greek word for “tongues” in each of these three instances is the same word used for “tongues” in Revelation 14:6, which means real languages. In 1 Corinthians Paul sheds more light on the subject. He emphasizes that tongues should be spoken that can be understood by those present, and if an unknown tongue is spoken, an interpreter should be used. He then concludes his remarks by making it clear that God is not the author of confusion. So speaking in tongues is a gift of the Spirit that gives a person the ability to speak another language, when that need is present, for the proclamation of the gospel. What warning is given regarding the Holy Spirit? “And the LORD said, My spirit shall not always strive with man, for that he also is flesh: yet his days shall be an hundred and twenty years.” —Genesis 6:3 “And grieve not the Holy Spirit of God, whereby ye are sealed unto the day of redemption.” —Ephesians 4:30 Because the Holy Spirit is a Person, He can be grieved, and when this happens, He stops striving with us, meaning He stops convicting us of sin and of righteousness, no longer leading us to abandon the things that are offensive to God (sins of commission) or to do what is right in the sight of God, which can turn into sins of omission, if refused. Grieving away the Holy Spirit is a frightful position to be in because once He ceases to invite a person to come to Christ there is no hope of salvation left. The Bible compares the Holy Spirit’s revelations of Bible truth with receiving light. As the Holy Spirit guides us into an understanding of Bible truth, and we choose to walk in that revealed light, God will continue giving us more light (Proverbs 4:18-19), but a persistent rejection of revealed truth can lead to the extinguishing of light, leaving us in the spiritual darkness of error (John 12:35). Paul describes this process as quenching the Spirit (1 Thessalonians 5:19), similar to how water quenches fire. In fact, Paul later warns that this quenching can lead to a delusion where error is accepted as truth (2 Thessalonians 2:10-12), which leads to the experience described in Matthew 7:22-23 where Jesus says “I never knew you” to those who thought they were saved but, actually, were lost because they had quenched the Spirit. In Matthew 7:21 Jesus says only those who do the will of His Father will enter the kingdom of heaven, so any teaching of “salvation in sin“ is not from God because it rejects the need of Jesus (as does “salvation by works“). A genuine acceptance of Jesus as Lord and Savior, that is motivated by love and gratitute, always leads to a changed lifestyle that is in harmony with His will, which is salvation from sin by faith in Jesus’ power to forgive, save, and transform (2 Corinthians 5:17; John 14:15). Who choose to obey Him because we are saved, not to be saved. What is blasphemy against the Spirit? “Wherefore I say unto you, All manner of sin and blasphemy shall be forgiven unto men: but the blasphemy against the Holy Ghost shall not be forgiven unto men. And whosoever speaketh a word against the Son of man, it shall be forgiven him: but whosoever speaketh against the Holy Ghost, it shall not be forgiven him, neither in this world, neither in the world to come.” —Matthew 12:31-32 We’ve learned that one of the roles of the Holy Spirit is to convict us of sin, and the Bible makes it clear that any sin that is confessed will be forgiven by Jesus (1 John 1:9). Blasphemy against the Holy Spirit, which cannot be forgiven, also known as the unpardonable sin, is a continual resisting or rejection of the Holy Spirit’s convicting, converting power, which leads to sins that are left unconfessed and, therefore, cannot be forgiven. This is why David, after committing the sin of adultery and murder, prayed that God would not take His Holy Spirit from him (Psalm 51:11) because he knew that only the Spirit was able to lead him to repentance and a transformation of heart. God is patient, continuing to plead even with resistant people, but He won’t force Himself on anyone, and there will come a time when His pleading will cease (Genesis 6:3), if continually resisted. Each refusal to surrender to the Holy Spirit’s convictions creates a more hardened heart that is less sensitive to future conviction, and if this is continued, the Spirit will eventually depart, leaving that person to live with the cherished, uncofessed sin for good. It’s unknown how long it takes to reach the point of no return, but one thing is certain: it’s never safe to say “no” to the Holy Spirit. The only wise thing to do is to surrender to the convictions of the Spirit by confessing and forsaking the sin being pointed out (1 John 1:9). By the way, if you feel concerned you have rejected the Holy Spirit then that is evidence you have not. Is it safe to ignore conviction? “I made haste, and delayed not to keep thy commandments.” —Psalm 119:60 “For he saith, I have heard thee in a time accepted, and in the day of salvation have I succoured thee: behold, now is the accepted time; behold, now is the day of salvation.” —2 Corinthians 6:2 “And now why tarriest thou? arise, and be baptized, and wash away thy sins, calling on the name of the Lord.” —Acts 22:16 Tomorrow is never guaranteed, so waiting to act on the pleadings of the Holy Spirit is never wise. Let’s not repeat the mistake Felix made when he chose to wait for a more convenient time to act (Acts 24:25), which never came. The good news is every time we choose to respond to the Holy Spirit’s convictions we yield to the power of the Spirit to change the mind and heart, and if we continue to cooperate with Him, He will transform our character to reflect the character of Jesus. Who does the Holy Spirit glorify? “He shall glorify me: for he shall receive of mine, and shall shew it unto you.” —John 16:14 “He that speaketh of himself seeketh his own glory: but he that seeketh his glory that sent him, the same is true, and no unrighteousness is in him.” —John 7:18 Being Christ’s personal representative on earth, the Holy Spirit’s ministry is about drawing people to and glorifying Jesus, just as Christ’s ministry was about glorifying His Father (John 17:4). Those who have the genuine spiritual gifts of the Spirit will not seek to draw attention to themselves, their own teachings, or the things of the world; the focus will be on Jesus, His teachings, and His heavenly kingdom. What promises does the Bible give us? “For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, they are the sons of God.” —Romans 8:14 “My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me: and I give unto them eternal life; and they shall never perish, neither shall any man pluck them out of my hand.” —John 10:27-28 As we commit our lives to Jesus and follow His Spirit’s leading, we become sons and daughters of God. His promise to us is He will keep us on course, leading us to His kingdom!\",\"series\":\"Baptized by the Spirit\"},\"12\":{\"title\":\"Christian Standards\",\"url\":\"/basics/standards/\",\"category\":\"Basics\",\"description\":\"Discover why followers of Christ are called to live differently and what that means practically.\",\"body\":\"What is the main motivator in a Christian’s life? “But God commendeth his love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us.” —Romans 5:8 “We love him, because he first loved us.” —1 John 4:19 Love for Christ is what moves a person to accept and follow Him. Without it, following Jesus turns into a burden. How is the Christian life and marriage similar? “And whatsoever we ask, we receive of him, because we keep his commandments, and do those things that are pleasing in his sight.” —2 Corinthians 5:20 Love for one’s spouse leads to a desire to please. That which is pleasing is practiced, and that which is displeasing is discontinued. The same is true in our relationship with Jesus. In His Word He outlines certain principles of conduct that please Him as well as those that displease Him, and a Christian who is filled with love for Jesus will find it a joy to do those things that make Him happy, while avoiding those that bring sorrow to His heart. What does pleasing God bring? “If ye keep my commandments, ye shall abide in my love; even as I have kept my Father’s commandments, and abide in his love. These things have I spoken unto you, that my joy might remain in you, and that your joy might be full.” —John 15:10-11 “The thief cometh not, but for to steal, and to kill, and to destroy: I am come that they might have life, and that they might have it more abundantly.” —John 10:10 God has given us certain principles because, as our Creator, He knows what is best for us. The enemy tries to portray these principles as legalistic and dull, because he wants us to stay away from them, but the truth is following them brings fullness of joy into the life. They are for our own good (Deuteronomy 6:24), safeguarding us from the danger of sin (Psalm 119:11), while also giving us the opportunity to express our love for Christ as we follow His example (John 14:15). What responsibility does a Christian have? “Now then we are ambassadors for Christ, as though God did beseech you by us: we pray you in Christ’s stead, be ye reconciled to God.” —2 Corinthians 5:20 “Now when they saw the boldness of Peter and John, and perceived that they were unlearned and ignorant men, they marvelled; and they took knowledge of them, that they had been with Jesus.” —Acts 4:13 “Go through, go through the gates; prepare ye the way of the people; cast up, cast up the highway; gather out the stones; lift up a standard for the people.” —Isaiah 62:10 Those who become followers of Christ become His ambassadors, representing Him wherever they go, whether in the family, at school, at work, or on vacation. Words and actions not only testify if the heart belongs to Christ, but they also have an influence on others. Jesus gave a solemn warning to Christians who are indifferent to their own example and influence (Matthew 18:6) as did Paul (Romans 14:7, 13). When people saw the conduct of Peter and John it was obvious to them that they were different because they had been with Jesus. May our walk with Christ transform us in like manner to reflect His character to those we come in contact with (Matthew 5:16). Does the Bible say about worldliness? “Love not the world, neither the things that are in the world. If any man love the world, the love of the Father is not in him. For all that is in the world, the lust of the flesh, and the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life, is not of the Father, but is of the world. And the world passeth away, and the lust thereof: but he that doeth the will of God abideth for ever.” —1 John 2:15-17 Every sin falls into one of three categories: 1) the lust of the flesh, 2) the lust of the eyes, or 3) the pride of life. These are the avenues through which Satan works to awaken in us a love for the world. Because we cannot serve two masters (Matthew 6:24), a love for the world decreases our love for God, whose principles are the exact opposite of those in the world, which is why James says that lovers of the world become enemies of God (James 4:4). We are called to be unspotted from the world (James 1:27) because the world, and its principles, will pass away, but the principles of God are eternal. What about conformity? “I beseech you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God, that ye present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God, which is your reasonable service. And be not conformed to this world: but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind, that ye may prove what is that good, and acceptable, and perfect, will of God.” —Romans 12:1-2 Living in a world of sin brings pressure to conform to its ways, to be squeezed into its mold, but God’s goal is to transform us by renewing our minds through the truth of His Word (John 17:17). Where does transformation start? “For as he thinketh in his heart, so is he.” —Proverbs 23:7 “But we all, with open face beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord, are changed into the same image from glory to glory, even as by the Spirit of the Lord.” —2 Corinthians 3:18 Transformation starts in the mind: thoughts turn into words, words into actions, actions into habits, and habits into character. Satan knows that we become what we repeatedly behold, which is why he has a myriad of ways to influence our thoughts through our five senses, but especially sight and hearing. Because we become what we see and hear, we are invited to behold the glory of God’s character by daily reading His letter to us—the Bible—so that we may become more like Him. What should I think about? “And the peace of God, which passeth all understanding, shall keep your hearts and minds through Christ Jesus. Finally, brethren, whatsoever things are true, whatsoever things are honest, whatsoever things are just, whatsoever things are pure, whatsoever things are lovely, whatsoever things are of good report; if there be any virtue, and if there be any praise, think on these things.” —Philippians 4:7-8 “Casting down imaginations, and every high thing that exalteth itself against the knowledge of God, and bringing into captivity every thought to the obedience of Christ.” —2 Corinthians 10:5 “Now the works of the flesh are manifest, which are these; adultery, fornication, uncleanness, lasciviousness, idolatry, witchcraft, hatred, variance, emulations, wrath, strife, seditions, heresies, envyings, murders, drunkenness, revellings, and such like: of the which I tell you before, as I have also told you in time past, that they which do such things shall not inherit the kingdom of God. But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, longsuffering, gentleness, goodness, faith, meekness, temperance: against such there is no law. And they that are Christ’s have crucified the flesh with the affections and lusts.” —Galatians 5:19-24 The above verses makes it clear there is little in modern entertainment that is fit for a Christian to watch. The list Paul provides in Philippians on the kind of thoughts we are to think about has implications on what a Christian will choose to avoid: - Dishonesty: lying, cheating, stealing, betrayal, or injustice. - Impurity: profanity, pornography, fornication, adultery, homosexuality, and watching or listening to anything that’s debasing. It’s unfortunate, but the lyrics of most secular songs glorify immoral behavior and numb our desire for spiritual things. Music is powerful because it bypasses the frontal lobe, the reasoning part of our brain, thereby appealing primarily to our emotions. It affects every function of the body, including pulse, breathing, and reflexes, but repetitive and syncopated rhythms, especially, alter mood and brain wave patterns, sending the listener into a type of hypnosis. At its best, music can be refreshing and uplifting, like it was to Saul when David played his harp (1 Samuel 16:23), but at its worst, it can be very degrading. Jesus wants to redeem us from the degradation of sin, and when we choose to follow Him, He will lead us to music that elevates, inspires, and refreshes. (For a deep dive into music, see the Distraction Dilemma seminar by Christian Berdahl.) Besides music, there is a second avenue into our mind: the things we watch. Do the TV shows, movies, and internet videos we watch increase our love for Jesus or the world? Do they promote the principles of His kingdom or those of the world? It’s no secret that the majority of modern entertainment falls into the latter category, and it is having an affect on society. One study found that without television “there would be 10,000 fewer murders per year in the United States, 70,000 fewer rapes, and 700,000 fewer assaults.” Time is finite and precious, so instead of beholding these vices, Jesus invites us to behold Him through, and be blessed by, the reading and study of His Word (Isaiah 45:22). Newsweek, “Violence, Reel to Reel”, Dec. 11, 1995, p. 47. Any other guidance? “The LORD trieth the righteous: but the wicked and him that loveth violence his soul hateth.” —Psalm 11:5 “Turn away mine eyes from beholding vanity; and quicken thou me in thy way.” —Psalm 119:37 “Let this mind be in you, which was also in Christ Jesus.” —Philippians 2:5 Instead of beholding vanity or violence, which are displeasing to God, we are invited to have the mind of Christ. It may seem like a high standard, but nothing is impossible to God (Mark 10:27). We can never accomplish it through our own power, but if we ask Him for it, He will give us a complete transformation of mind (1 Corinthians 6:9-11). Am I able to decide what is right? “Ye shall not do after all the things that we do here this day, every man whatsoever is right in his own eyes.” —Deuteronomy 12:8 “There is a way that seemeth right unto a man, but the end thereof are the ways of death.” —Proverbs 16:25 “The way of a fool is right in his own eyes: but he that hearkeneth unto counsel is wise.” —Proverbs 12:15 “Be not wise in thine own eyes: fear the LORD, and depart from evil. It shall be health to thy navel, and marrow to thy bones.” —Proverbs 3:7-8 Sin has so perverted our sensibility to what is right and wrong that, without God drawing a clear distinction between the two in His Word, we are incapable of making the distinction ourselves. The key question He would like us to ask is will this music, movie, TV show, or book honor You? How should I dress? “In like manner also, that the women adorn themselves in modest apparel, with propriety and moderation, not with braided hair or gold or pearls or costly clothing, but, which is proper for women professing godliness, with good works.” —1 Timothy 2:9-10, NKJV God’s counsel regarding clothing, which applies to both men and women, is modesty, propriety, and moderation. The key word is moderation, which means we are to avoid expensive clothes, but we are not to dress in sackcloth either. Our clothing should be clean, neat, and modest. What is a Christian’s true adornment? “While they behold your chaste conversation coupled with fear. Whose adorning let it not be that outward adorning of plaiting the hair, and of wearing of gold, or of putting on of apparel; but let it be the hidden man of the heart, in that which is not corruptible, even the ornament of a meek and quiet spirit, which is in the sight of God of great price.” —1 Peter 3:2-4 The ornaments God desires His people to wear are not outward ones; rather, it’s the adornment of the heart—possessing a character that reflects Jesus. What does God say about jewelry? “Moreover the LORD saith, Because the daughters of Zion are haughty, and walk with stretched forth necks and wanton eyes, walking and mincing as they go, and making a tinkling with their feet. Therefore the Lord will smite with a scab the crown of the head of the daughters of Zion, and the LORD will discover their secret parts. In that day the Lord will take away the bravery of their tinkling ornaments about their feet, and their cauls, and their round tires like the moon, the chains, and the bracelets, and the mufflers, the bonnets, and the ornaments of the legs, and the headbands, and the tablets, and the earrings, the rings, and nose jewels, the changeable suits of apparel, and the mantles, and the wimples, and the crisping pins, the glasses, and the fine linen, and the hoods, and the vails. And it shall come to pass, that instead of sweet smell there shall be stink; and instead of a girdle a rent; and instead of well set hair baldness; and instead of a stomacher a girding of sackcloth; and burning instead of beauty.” —Isaiah 3:16-24 God clearly shows His displeasure when His people, referred to as daughters of Zion, adorn themselves on the outside and lack the adornment that truly matters—the adornment of character. What is jewelry associated with? “And I will visit upon her the days of Baalim, wherein she burned incense to them, and she decked herself with her earrings and her jewels, and she went after her lovers, and forgat me, saith the LORD.” —Hosea 2:13 “Then Jacob said unto his household, and to all that were with him, Put away the strange gods that are among you, and be clean, and change your garments: and let us arise, and go up to Bethel; and I will make there an altar unto God, who answered me in the day of my distress, and was with me in the way which I went. And they gave unto Jacob all the strange gods which were in their hand, and all their earrings which were in their ears; and Jacob hid them under the oak which was by Shechem.” —Genesis 35:2-4 “Unto a land flowing with milk and honey: for I will not go up in the midst of thee; for thou art a stiffnecked people: lest I consume thee in the way. And when the people heard these evil tidings, they mourned: and no man did put on him his ornaments. For the LORD had said unto Moses, Say unto the children of Israel, Ye are a stiffnecked people: I will come up into the midst of thee in a moment, and consume thee: therefore now put off thy ornaments from thee, that I may know what to do unto thee. And the children of Israel stripped themselves of their ornaments by the mount Horeb.” —Exodus 33:3-6 In the Bible jewelry is associated with idolatry, backsliding, apostasy, and forgetting God. By its very nature, jewelry draws attention to and exalts self, thus appealing to pride (1 John 2:16). The putting away of jewelry, on the other hand, is associated with repentance and turning back to God. For example, when Jacob chose to rededicate his life to God, he told his family to destroy their idols and to remove their jewelry. When the Israelites mourned their apostasy of worshiping the golden calf, God told them to put away their jewelry, and they did. How is the apostate church of Revelation portrayed? “And there came one of the seven angels which had the seven vials, and talked with me, saying unto me, Come hither; I will shew unto thee the judgment of the great whore that sitteth upon many waters: with whom the kings of the earth have committed fornication, and the inhabitants of the earth have been made drunk with the wine of her fornication. So he carried me away in the spirit into the wilderness: and I saw a woman sit upon a scarlet coloured beast, full of names of blasphemy, having seven heads and ten horns. And the woman was arrayed in purple and scarlet colour, and decked with gold and precious stones and pearls, having a golden cup in her hand full of abominations and filthiness of her fornication: and upon her forehead was a name written, MYSTERY, BABYLON THE GREAT, THE MOTHER OF HARLOTS AND ABOMINATIONS OF THE EARTH.” —Revelation 17:1-5 “And he cried mightily with a strong voice, saying, Babylon the great is fallen, is fallen, and is become the habitation of devils, and the hold of every foul spirit, and a cage of every unclean and hateful bird. For all nations have drunk of the wine of the wrath of her fornication, and the kings of the earth have committed fornication with her, and the merchants of the earth are waxed rich through the abundance of her delicacies. And I heard another voice from heaven, saying, Come out of her, my people, that ye be not partakers of her sins, and that ye receive not of her plagues.” —Revelation 18:2-4 The apostate chuch of Revelation, having abandoned her loyalty to Jesus Christ, is shown as being decked with jewelry, which is in contrast to God’s true church of Revelation 12:1 clothed with the sun, a symbol of Jesus’ righteousness (Malachi 4:2). God later calls His people to separate from Babylon and everything it stands for, including jewelry, pomp, and the exaltation of self. Instead, we are called to be clothed with the garments of salvation and Christ’s righteousness (Isaiah 61:10). Is obedience legalism? “Know ye not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God? Be not deceived: neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor effeminate, nor abusers of themselves with mankind, nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor extortioners, shall inherit the kingdom of God. And such were some of you: but ye are washed, but ye are sanctified, but ye are justified in the name of the Lord Jesus, and by the Spirit of our God.” —1 Corinthians 6:9-11 “Thou believest that there is one God; thou doest well: the devils also believe, and tremble. But wilt thou know, O vain man, that faith without works is dead? Was not Abraham our father justified by works, when he had offered Isaac his son upon the altar? Seest thou how faith wrought with his works, and by works was faith made perfect? And the scripture was fulfilled which saith, Abraham believed God, and it was imputed unto him for righteousness: and he was called the Friend of God. Ye see then how that by works a man is justified, and not by faith only.” —James 2:19-24 “Even so every good tree bringeth forth good fruit; but a corrupt tree bringeth forth evil fruit. A good tree cannot bring forth evil fruit, neither can a corrupt tree bring forth good fruit. Every tree that bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down, and cast into the fire. Wherefore by their fruits ye shall know them.” —Matthew 7:17-20 We obey Him because we are saved, not to be saved. The Bible is clear we are saved by God’s grace through faith (Ephesians 2:8), and because there is nothing we can do to be saved, when we accept His free gift of redemption from sin, we develop gratitude and love for Jesus that naturally makes us want to please Him, just as Jesus lived to please His Father in everything He did (John 8:29). For a person who genuinely loves Christ it’s a joy to discover His will in the Bible and to follow it in all areas of life. A conversion without a transformation of character or change in lifestyle, on the other hand, is most likely not genuine because faith without works is dead. A tree is known by its fruit, and genuine faith will produce a life that is obedient to Christ in an expression of love for Him. Is the Christian life appealing to all? “But the natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God: for they are foolishness unto him: neither can he know them, because they are spiritually discerned.” —1 Corinthians 2:14 “For they that are after the flesh do mind the things of the flesh; but they that are after the Spirit the things of the Spirit. For to be carnally minded is death; but to be spiritually minded is life and peace. Because the carnal mind is enmity against God: for it is not subject to the law of God, neither indeed can be. So then they that are in the flesh cannot please God.” —Romans 8:5-8 The principles of Jesus are for those who are looking to be led by His Spirit. The world lacks spiritual discernment, so it will consider the things of God as foolishness. In fact, unconverted people would find heaven a bore because their love for worldly things could never be satisfied. This is why Jesus wants to change our tastes here on earth by calling us to be separate from the world (2 Corinthians 6:17) because the truth is we cannot serve two masters (Matthew 6:24). Many try to follow Christ while staying as close as possible to the world, but a house divided against itself cannot stand (Matthew 12:25). Moreover, Jesus will never withhold from us anything that is good (Psalm 84:11) but only those things that are harmful. We may not always understand why He asks us to do certain things, but motivated by love, we can give Him the benefit of the doubt, trusting that He always has our best interest in mind. What if changing my habits feels overwhelming? “And they were astonished out of measure, saying among themselves, Who then can be saved? And Jesus looking upon them saith, With men it is impossible, but not with God: for with God all things are possible.” —Mark 10:26-27 “Sanctify them through thy truth: thy word is truth.” —John 17:17 Changing our tastes and habits is often overwhelming, and the truth is we cannot do it ourselves, but if we are willing to change and have faith in God’s power to do it, He will give us a love for the pure, holy, and righteous. What He needs from us is a willingness to separate from the things of the world and a desire to draw close to Him by spending more time with Him in His Word, through which He can then sanctify us (John 17:17). The more time we spend with Him, the more we will love Him, and the more we will want to please Him. Having our consent, He will then have the freedom to change us into His image (2 Corinthians 3:18), and people will take notice that we had been with Jesus (Acts 4:13). What is Jesus’ desire for me? “Ye are the light of the world. A city that is set on an hill cannot be hid.” —Matthew 5:14 “I will greatly rejoice in the LORD, my soul shall be joyful in my God; for he hath clothed me with the garments of salvation, he hath covered me with the robe of righteousness, as a bridegroom decketh himself with ornaments, and as a bride adorneth herself with her jewels.” —Isaiah 61:10 “If ye know these things, happy are ye if ye do them.” —John 13:17 “I delight to do thy will, O my God: yea, thy law is within my heart.” —Psalm 40:8 Christ is looking for people who are willing to be fully surrendered to Him so that He can make them a light in a world that is only getting darker, people who are willing to be different, who want to be clothed with His garments of salvation and covered with His robe of rigtheousness. He is looking for a people who will rejoice in His redemption from, and victory over, sin in their lives, people who realize that true happiness, which is in such short supply in this world, comes from knowing and doing His will.\",\"series\":\"The Christian Life\"},\"13\":{\"title\":\"First Day Texts\",\"url\":\"/basics/sunday/\",\"category\":\"Basics\",\"description\":\"Does the Bible have evidence of the Sabbath being changed?

It is a sign between me and the children of Israel for ever: for in six days the LORD made heaven and earth, and on the seventh day he rested, and was refreshed. And he gave unto Moses, when he had made an end of communing with him upon mount Sinai, two tables of testimony, tables of stone, written with the finger of God.” —Exodus 31:16-18 The Ten Commandments, of which the Sabbath is a part, were written by the finger of God on tablets of stone rather than on materials subject to decay, such as wood or clay, as a testament to their timelessness (Matthew 5:17-18). Was the Sabbath for the Jewish people only? “Thus the heavens and the earth were finished, and all the host of them. And on the seventh day God ended his work which he had made; and he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had made. And God blessed the seventh day, and sanctified it: because that in it he had rested from all his work which God created and made.” —Genesis 2:1-3 “For as the new heavens and the new earth, which I will make, shall remain before me, saith the LORD, so shall your seed and your name remain. And it shall come to pass, that from one new moon to another, and from one sabbath to another, shall all flesh come to worship before me, saith the LORD.” —Isaiah 66:22-23 The seventh-day Sabbath was set apart, blessed, and sanctified in the very first week of creation, long before there was a Jewish nation, and it will be kept even in heaven as a testament to God as our Creator and Redeemer. The Sabbath was instituted in Eden for all humanity, and as long as we are His creation, whom He has redeemed, so long will the Sabbath stand. How many need sanctification? “For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God.” —Romans 3:23 “Moreover also I gave them my sabbaths, to be a sign between me and them, that they might know that I am the LORD that sanctify them.” —Ezekiel 20:12 Because all have sinned, all need the sanctifying power of Christ—of which the Sabbath is a sign; therefore, it cannot be a sign for the Jewish nation only, for sin is no respecter of persons, just as God’s power to sanctify is no respecter of sinners. As God set the Sabbath apart as a day for Himself, so He sets us apart as a people for Himself (1 Peter 2:9; 2 Corinthians 6:17-18). Is the Sabbath an antidote to salvation by works? “For he spake in a certain place of the seventh day on this wise, and God did rest the seventh day from all his works. … There remaineth therefore a rest to the people of God. For he that is entered into his rest, he also hath ceased from his own works, as God did from his. Let us labour therefore to enter into that rest, lest any man fall after the same example of unbelief.” —Hebrews 4:4-6, 9-11 The Sabbath is a memorial of God as both Creator and Redeemer. Just as He rested from His work of creation on the seventh day, so Jesus rested from His work of redemption in the tomb. The Sabbath, therefore, is a sign of resting in Christ by faith in His completed work on my behalf. In other words, to deny the Sabbath is, in essence, to deny salvation by faith. Because I cannot sanctify or save myself, I am invited to cease striving for salvation by my own works and to rest in the righteous life of Jesus instead. By resting on the seventh day, I acknowledge this sublime truth. What happened as the Sabbath approached after Jesus died? “And that day was the preparation, and the sabbath drew on. And the women also, which came with him from Galilee, followed after, and beheld the sepulchre, and how his body was laid. And they returned, and prepared spices and ointments; and rested the sabbath day according to the commandment.” —Luke 23:54-56 The Bible points out that, since it was the Day of Preparation (Friday) and the Sabbath was about to begin at sunset, Jesus’ followers were so concerned about keeping the Sabbath that they even stopped their labor of love in preparing the body of their beloved Savior for burial. They rested on the Sabbath, as commanded, and returned early on Sunday morning to resume their unfinished work. What happened on the first day? “Now upon the first day of the week, very early in the morning, they came unto the sepulchre, bringing the spices which they had prepared, and certain others with them.” —Luke 24:1 “In the end of the sabbath, as it began to dawn toward the first day of the week, came Mary Magdalene and the other Mary to see the sepulchre.” —Matthew 28:1 “And very early in the morning the first day of the week, they came unto the sepulchre at the rising of the sun.” —Mark 16:2 “The first day of the week cometh Mary Magdalene early, when it was yet dark, unto the sepulchre, and seeth the stone taken away from the sepulchre.” —John 20:1 It is important to note that Jesus’ followers returned to the tomb because they still had unfinished burial work to complete. Since they brought spices with them, it is evident they did not expect to find Him resurrected, so their Sunday morning labor of love was not an act of honoring His resurrection but rather a continuation of their burial work. Did Jesus command the keeping of Sunday? “Now when Jesus was risen early the first day of the week, he appeared first to Mary Magdalene, out of whom he had cast seven devils. And she went and told them that had been with him, as they mourned and wept.” —Mark 16:9 “Jesus saith unto her, Woman, why weepest thou? whom seekest thou? She, supposing him to be the gardener, saith unto him, Sir, if thou have borne him hence, tell me where thou hast laid him, and I will take him away. Jesus saith unto her, Mary. She turned herself, and saith unto him, Rabboni; which is to say, Master. Jesus saith unto her, Touch me not; for I am not yet ascended to my Father: but go to my brethren, and say unto them, I ascend unto my Father, and your Father; and to my God, and your God. Mary Magdalene came and told the disciples that she had seen the Lord, and that he had spoken these things unto her.” —John 20:15-18 After His resurrection, Jesus had multiple opportunities to instruct His followers to keep Sunday as the new Sabbath in honor of His resurrection, but this He never did. When He appeared to Mary Magdalene that morning, there was no mention of Sunday at all. Considering the many Old Testament passages in which God directly commands the observance of the seventh-day Sabbath, one would reasonably expect at least one verse in the New Testament where Jesus—or His Father—commands His followers to keep Sunday instead. Yet no such verse exists. All we have is alleged circumstantial evidence, which, when closely examined, falls apart as well. How do we honor Jesus’ resurrection? “Know ye not, that so many of us as were baptized into Jesus Christ were baptized into his death? Therefore we are buried with him by baptism into death: that like as Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the Father, even so we also should walk in newness of life. For if we have been planted together in the likeness of his death, we shall be also in the likeness of his resurrection: knowing this, that our old man is crucified with him, that the body of sin might be destroyed, that henceforth we should not serve sin. For he that is dead is freed from sin. Now if we be dead with Christ, we believe that we shall also live with him.” —Romans 6:3-8 Jesus instituted baptism by immersion as a symbol of His death, burial, and resurrection. In baptism, a person goes briefly under the water, representing death to sin and burial with Christ, and then rises out of the water to a new life in and for Christ. Didn’t the disciples break bread on the first day? “And upon the first day of the week, when the disciples came together to break bread, Paul preached unto them, ready to depart on the morrow; and continued his speech until midnight.” —Acts 20:7 “And they continued stedfastly in the apostles’ doctrine and fellowship, and in breaking of bread, and in prayers. … And they, continuing daily with one accord in the temple, and breaking bread from house to house, did eat their meat with gladness and singleness of heart.” —Acts 2:42, 46 The meeting in which bread was broken on the first day of the week occurred because Paul was leaving the next day. Apart from this unique circumstance, the meeting had no special significance, since the early Christians broke bread daily. What about John 20:19? “Mary Magdalene came and told the disciples that she had seen the Lord, and that he had spoken these things unto her. Then the same day at evening, being the first day of the week, when the doors were shut where the disciples were assembled for fear of the Jews, came Jesus and stood in the midst, and saith unto them, Peace be unto you. And when he had so said, he shewed unto them his hands and his side. Then were the disciples glad, when they saw the Lord. Then said Jesus to them again, Peace be unto you: as my Father hath sent me, even so send I you.” —John 20:18-21 “Afterward he appeared unto the eleven as they sat at meat, and upbraided them with their unbelief and hardness of heart, because they believed not them which had seen him after he was risen.” —Mark 16:14 Mark tells us that after Jesus’ disciples heard He had risen, they did not at first believe the reports, so later that same day He appeared to them in person. Since they did not believe He had risen, they could not have gathered to honor His resurrection. Moreover, after He appeared, He had the perfect opportunity to declare Sunday holy, but—just as in His interaction with Mary—He did not do so. Finally, according to the Bible, days begin at sunset (Genesis 1:5); thus, biblically—and for the Jews—this Sunday evening gathering would actually have been Monday. How about 1 Corinthians 16:2? “Now concerning the collection for the saints, as I have given order to the churches of Galatia, even so do ye. Upon the first day of the week let every one of you lay by him in store, as God hath prospered him, that there be no gatherings when I come. And when I come, whomsoever ye shall approve by your letters, them will I send to bring your liberality unto Jerusalem.” —1 Corinthians 16:1-3 In this passage, Paul is encouraging the Corinthians to remember their fellow believers in Judea, who were experiencing a famine (Acts 11:27-30), by putting money aside on Sunday, the day when financial matters were typically settled, after the Sabbath had passed, so that the funds would be ready when he visited them. The money was to be set aside privately, according to each person’s financial ability, and on a weekly basis rather than in a one-time donation, in order to encourage systematic giving. Nothing in these passages indicates that a worship gathering occurred on Sunday or that these offerings were collected during such a service. What about Romans 14:5-6? “One man esteemeth one day above another: another esteemeth every day alike. Let every man be fully persuaded in his own mind. He that regardeth the day, regardeth it unto the Lord; and he that regardeth not the day, to the Lord he doth not regard it. He that eateth, eateth to the Lord, for he giveth God thanks; and he that eateth not, to the Lord he eateth not, and giveth God thanks.” —Romans 14:5-6 Looking at the context, verse 1 shows that Paul is addressing “doubtful disputations” (Romans 14:1), meaning issues of personal preference related to ceremonial practices. Verses 2 and 3 offer further insight: the controversy was actually about fasting (Romans 14:2-3, 6). Some Jewish Christians thought all believers were obligated to fast on specific days; by contrast, Gentile Christians, who were unfamiliar with such ceremonial observances, had a different view. Seeking reconciliation, Paul urged them to stop passing judgment on one another in these matters. The Sabbath, however, cannot be considered a “doubtful disputation,” since it is not part of the ceremonial law; rather, it belongs to God’s unchanging, moral law—the Ten Commandments—established at creation. How about Colossians 2:16-17? “Let no man therefore judge you in meat, or in drink, or in respect of a holyday [festival], or of the new moon, or of the sabbath days: which are a shadow of things to come; but the body is of Christ.” —Colossians 2:16-17 The fact that the passage mentions food, drink, festivals, and new moons in connection with “sabbath days” indicates that, once again, it is referring to the ceremonial laws. These are described as “a shadow of things to come” because they all pointed forward to Christ. When the veil of the temple was supernaturally torn from top to bottom at Christ’s death, God signified that these ceremonial laws had met their fulfillment in His Son and were no longer needed (Ephesians 2:14-15), for the great sacrifice to which they all pointed had been made. In contrast to the Ten Commandments, which were written by God Himself on stone and placed inside the ark of the covenant (Deuteronomy 10:3-5), the ceremonial laws were written by Moses on parchment and placed beside the ark (Deuteronomy 31:24-26). The “sabbath days” mentioned as part of the ceremonial law refer to the yearly sabbaths described in Leviticus 23:24-38, not the weekly Sabbath that is part of the moral law. These annual sabbaths fell on specific days of the month each year (for example, the first, ninth, tenth, or fifteenth day), yet they were still called sabbaths because the people were to rest from their work on those days. What is the Lord’s day? “I was in the Spirit on the Lord’s day, and heard behind me a great voice, as of a trumpet.” —Revelation 1:10 “And he said unto them, The sabbath was made for man, and not man for the sabbath: Therefore the Son of man is Lord also of the sabbath.” —Mark 2:27-28 “But the seventh day is the sabbath of the LORD thy God: in it thou shalt not do any work, thou, nor thy son, nor thy daughter, thy manservant, nor thy maidservant, nor thy cattle, nor thy stranger that is within thy gates.” —Exodus 20:10 “Six days shall work be done: but the seventh day is the sabbath of rest, a holy convocation; ye shall do no work therein: it is the sabbath of the LORD in all your dwellings.” —Leviticus 23:3 Biblically, there is only one day that the Lord God claims as His own—the seventh-day Sabbath. Jesus affirmed this, and the fourth commandment clearly identifies it as such. Unfortunately, “the Lord’s day” is widely misinterpreted as referring to Sunday, even though there is no Scriptural evidence to support this. What did Jesus teach about the law? “Think not that I am come to destroy the law, or the prophets: I am not come to destroy, but to fulfil. For verily I say unto you, till heaven and earth pass, one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law, till all be fulfilled.” —Matthew 5:17-18 There are no verses in the Bible showing that Jesus changed the fourth commandment to mean observing Sunday instead of Saturday, nor did He instruct others to do so later on. On the contrary, His mission was to fulfill the law and to uphold and expand it beyond the mere “letter” of the law to include the “spirit” of the law as well. For instance, Jesus expanded the commandment against adultery to include lust (Matthew 5:28) and the commandment against murder to include hatred (Matthew 5:21-22). Law is the foundation of all government—both on earth and in heaven. Since Jesus does not change, His government, and therefore, His law, cannot change; otherwise, the wisdom, authority, and stability of His rule would immediately come into question. After all, if one of His commandments can change, why not the other nine? Most people agree with His prohibitions against having other gods, idolatry, blasphemy, dishonoring parents, murder, theft, adultery, bearing false witness, or covetousness. But what about the fourth commandment? Many acknowledge the need for weekly rest, yet the specific day on which to rest is often regarded as a matter of personal opinion. The Sabbath commandment is the only one that establishes God’s authority to give the other nine—by the simple fact that we are the created and He is the Creator. Furthermore, without the fourth commandment, anyone could have given the other nine. The Sabbath, therefore, stands as His signature upon the entire Decalogue. But does God really care about the day we honor? Yes, He does. Did He care about the tree from which Eve ate? Most definitely. Does He mean what He says? Absolutely. Ultimately, the day we choose to honor is both a test of obedience and a question of authority: whose authority will I acknowledge and submit to—God’s or someone else’s? It is a simple yet profound decision that every person must make.\",\"series\":\"The Counterfeit Sabbath\"},\"14\":{\"title\":\"Finances, God’s Way\",\"url\":\"/basics/tithe/\",\"category\":\"Basics\",\"description\":\"Financial investment advice in the Bible? Discover God’s plan for managing our finances wisely.\",\"body\":\"Who is the true owner of everything on earth? “In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth.” —Genesis 1:1 “The earth is the LORD’S, and the fulness thereof; the world, and they that dwell therein.” —Psalm 24:1 “For every beast of the forest is mine, and the cattle upon a thousand hills. I know all the fowls of the mountains: and the wild beasts of the field are mine. If I were hungry, I would not tell thee: for the world is mine, and the fulness thereof.” —Psalm 50:10-12 The Bible teaches that the earth and everything in it belongs to God because He is its Creator; we are simply managers, or stewards, of His property and His goods (Matthew 25:14). From whom do financial blessings flow? “The silver is mine, and the gold is mine, saith the LORD of hosts.” —Haggai 2:8 “But thou shalt remember the LORD thy God: for it is he that giveth thee power to get wealth, that he may establish his covenant which he sware unto thy fathers, as it is this day.” —Deuteronomy 8:18 “Every good gift and every perfect gift is from above, and cometh down from the Father of lights, with whom is no variableness, neither shadow of turning.” —James 1:17 God is also the true owner of all the wealth of the world, and it is He who gives us power to obtain the wealth that we have. In fact, James says that God is the source of all our blessings, not just the financial ones. What percentage of income belongs to the Lord? “And all the tithe of the land, whether of the seed of the land, or of the fruit of the tree, is the LORD’S: it is holy unto the LORD. … And concerning the tithe of the herd, or of the flock, even of whatsoever passeth under the rod, the tenth shall be holy unto the LORD.” —Leviticus 27:30, 32 The Bible says that a tenth of our income belongs to God (the word “tithe” means “a tenth”). This means that when we tithe we aren’t making a gift but are simply returning what already belongs to Him. Tithing, perhaps more than anything else, tends to reveal the true posture of our heart, because when it truly belongs to Him, tithe is returned cheerfully (2 Corinthians 9:7), out of love and gratitude for Him and as an act of faith that He will continue to take care of us in the future. Some may think that they cannot afford to tithe, but the truth is a person cannot afford not to tithe. Because God has promised a blessing on those who tithe, the 90% that is blessed by God will go much father than the 100% without His blessing. God invites anyone who is unsure about tithing to put Him to the test and see how faithful He will be to His promise (Malachi 3:10). Incidentally, Adam and Eve failed the test of trusting God because, out of all the trees they could freely eat from, they took of the one that was not theirs. Similarly, all the blessings we have in life are from God (James 1:17), but He only claims a tenth of our income as His. In reality, it’s not our money that He wants, but our loyalty and trust, because when we tithe, we enter into a partnership with Him, acknowledging His blessings and trusting that He will continue to provide. What was the tithe instituted for? “And, behold, I have given the children of Levi all the tenth in Israel for an inheritance, for their service which they serve, even the service of the tabernacle of the congregation.” —Numbers 18:21 When the Israelites entered the Promised Land, the tribe of Levi received certain cities from God, but they did not receive a large plot of land to live off, like the other tribes did, because the tribe of Levi was set apart for ministry in the sanctuary, and so God arranged to support them with the tithe as their source of income. What about the ministers of today? “Do ye not know that they which minister about holy things live of the things of the temple? and they which wait at the altar are partakers with the altar? Even so hath the Lord ordained that they which preach the gospel should live of the gospel.” —1 Corinthians 9:13-14 “Bring ye all the tithes into the storehouse, that there may be meat [food] in mine house, and prove me now herewith, saith the LORD of hosts, if I will not open you the windows of heaven, and pour you out a blessing, that there shall not be room enough to receive it.” —Malachi 3:10 “For the Scripture says, “You shall not muzzle an ox while it treads out the grain,” and, “The laborer is worthy of his wages.”” —1 Timothy 5:18, NKJV Paul is clear that tithing is still God’s method of supporting the ministers of today as they dedicate their lives to the preaching of the gospel. This gives every follower of Jesus the privilege to participate in the blessing of spreading the gospel throughout the world. God confirms this in the book of Malachi when He invites His followers to bring their tithe into His storehouse so that it could be provisioned with food for the priests ministering in the temple (Nehemiah 10:37-38). Today’s equivalent of the storehouse would be the church, which then uses the tithe to support its pastors. By the way, Malachi makes it clear that the tithe is to be used solely for the work of ministry, nothing else. Some may also wonder whether tithing comes out of pre- or post-tax income, but the truth is that it’s not possible to actually outgive God (Luke 6:38), so if the government gets a cut from our gross then certainly our heavenly Father deserves better than what is left after tax. Did Jesus say anything about tithing? “Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye pay tithe of mint and anise and cummin, and have omitted the weightier matters of the law, judgment, mercy, and faith: these ought ye to have done, and not to leave the other undone.” —Matthew 23:23 Here Jesus pointed out that it is possible to do the right thing and still have an uncoverted heart. The Pharisees were careful to observe religious principles, but they did not experience the converting power of the Holy Spirit upon the heart. This conversion is what Jesus referred to when He told Nicodemus that one cannot enter the kingdom of God without being born again (John 3:3-5), but once it takes place, the fruits of the Spirit are then evident in the life (Galatians 5:22-25). This is why Jesus rebuked the Pharisees for failing to show justice, mercy, and grace, but notice that He did commend their practice of returning tithe. Is tithing only for the Jewish people? “And Melchizedek king of Salem brought forth bread and wine: and he was the priest of the most high God. And he blessed him, and said, Blessed be Abram of the most high God, possessor of heaven and earth, and blessed be the most high God, which hath delivered thine enemies into thy hand. And he gave him tithes of all.” —Genesis 14:20 “And this stone, which I have set for a pillar, shall be God’s house: and of all that thou shalt give me I will surely give the tenth unto thee.” —Genesis 28:22 Genesis tells us that tithing was practiced by Abram and Jacob before the existance of the Israelite nation, which means that God gives everyone the privilege to honor Him by returning a tenth of His blessings. This also means that tithing was not abolished at the cross because it was never limited to the laws and ordinances of Moses. Can I chose where my tithe goes? “And all the tithe of the land, whether of the seed of the land, or of the fruit of the tree, is the LORD’S: it is holy unto the LORD.” —Leviticus 27:30 God has claimed the tithe as His own, reserving it for the work of ministry (Malachi 3:10), and He has called it holy, so the decision to use it for another purpose, such as charitable giving, is not for us to make. How should I support other worthy causes? “Give unto the LORD the glory due unto his name: bring an offering, and come into his courts.” —Psalm 96:8 “Every man according as he purposeth in his heart, so let him give; not grudgingly, or of necessity: for God loveth a cheerful giver.” —2 Corinthians 9:7 “Every man shall give as he is able, according to the blessing of the LORD thy God which he hath given thee.” —Deuteronomy 16:17 The Bible does make provision for the use of voluntary offerings for other worthy causes, which are given according to the discretion of the giver; however, it’s important to note that God does not want us to give grudgingly, but only if it comes from a cheerful, willing heart. How important is faithfulness in returning tithe? “Will a man rob God? Yet ye have robbed me. But ye say, Wherein have we robbed thee? In tithes and offerings. Ye are cursed with a curse: for ye have robbed me, even this whole nation. Bring ye all the tithes into the storehouse, that there may be meat in mine house, and prove me now herewith, saith the LORD of hosts, if I will not open you the windows of heaven, and pour you out a blessing, that there shall not be room enough to receive it. And I will rebuke the devourer for your sakes, and he shall not destroy the fruits of your ground; neither shall your vine cast her fruit before the time in the field, saith the LORD of hosts.” —Malachi 3:8-11 Because the tithe belongs to the Lord, the Bible says that neglecting to return it is robbery of God, which is a violation of the eight commandment (Exodus 20:15): “Thou shalt not steal.” Ultimately, it’s not our money that God is after, but our heart, and a willingness to obey Him, out of love, in all things, is evidence of a heart that is surrendered. Moreover, Malachi teaches that it’s not really possible to outgive God because His generosity exceeds our ability to receive (Malachi 3:10), and it’s this generosity that He wants to develop in our own lives. He wants us to share in the blessing of giving—to realize that “it is more blessed to give than to receive” (Acts 20:35). Ultimately, though, His greatest desire is for us to enter into a trusting relationship with Him. It’s also important to note that the promise of God’s blessing on those who faithfully tithe does not guarantee protection from hardship because we still live in a world of sin, nor does it guarantee financial prosperity because God is the one who chooses the type of blessing. While He can and does bless His people financially, there are other forms of blessing too, such as good health, peace of mind, protection, wisdom, good family relations, solid friendships, old things lasting longer, and others. The Bible says the poor will always be with us (John 12:8), so just as financial prosperity is not necessarily a sign of God’s blessing, a lack of it is not a sign of His disapproval. We can rest assured that our heavenly Father is acquainted with all of our needs, and He will give us the right blessing at the right time (1 Peter 5:7). How can I be sure I’m tithing for the right reason? “If ye love me, keep my commandments.” —John 14:15 “But God be thanked, that ye were the servants of sin, but ye have obeyed from the heart that form of doctrine which was delivered you.” —Romans 6:17 Obedience with tithing, as with the Ten Commandments, is not a form righteousness by works because the Bible is clear that we are saved by faith only (Ephesians 2:8-9). We obey not to be saved but because we are saved by the grace and mercy of God that is freely available to all. When His love for us awakens a love for Him then it is only natural to want to please the person we genuinely love. Of course, this desire and ability to obey God comes only through the work of the Holy Spirit upon the heart, which Paul so eloquently explains in Romans 8:4-9. Such obedience can only be righteousness by faith because it is not our own, but it is evidence that love for God reigns supreme in the heart. Could the tithing system be abused? “Then saith one of his disciples, Judas Iscariot, Simon’s son, which should betray him, Why was not this ointment sold for three hundred pence, and given to the poor? This he said, not that he cared for the poor; but because he was a thief, and had the bag, and bare what was put therein.” —John 12:4-6 Where there are people there will be room for dishonesty, but human weakness is not an excuse for us not to be faithful to God. After all, Judas, one of Christ’s own disciples, was a thief. Remember, Christ commended the poor widow who gave all that she had to a church whose leaders would later crucify Him (Mark 12:41-44), but He still honored her because she gave out of love and faithfulness to Him (Hebrews 7:8). Our part is to be faithful to God, but once the money leaves our hands, it becomes His responsibility to deal with any potential misuse of His funds. What promises does God give us? “There is that scattereth, and yet increaseth; and there is that withholdeth more than is meet, but it tendeth to poverty. The liberal soul shall be made fat: and he that watereth shall be watered also himself.” —Proverbs 11:24,25 “Honour the LORD with thy substance, and with the firstfruits of all thine increase: so shall thy barns be filled with plenty, and thy presses shall burst out with new wine.” —Proverbs 3:9,10 What advice does Jesus give regarding life priorities? “Lay not up for yourselves treasures upon earth, where moth and rust doth corrupt, and where thieves break through and steal: but lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust doth corrupt, and where thieves do not break through nor steal: for where your treasure is, there will your heart be also.” —Matthew 6:19-21 “But seek ye first the kingdom of God, and his righteousness; and all these things shall be added unto you.” —Matthew 6:33 “If ye know these things, happy are ye if ye do them.” —John 13:17 Jesus invites us to store treasure in heaven, not on earth, because our hearts are tightly linked with our investments. The heart focused on accumulating more and more money becomes greedy and covetous, but if the focus is on sharing the good news of Jesus then it becomes generous, loving, and joyful. Many people make the things of the world their first priority, and they still worry about their future, but Jesus asks His followers to do the opposite—to seek first His kingdom and His righteousness, and the promise is He will take care of everything else. So let’s trust Him fully and seek His will in everything we do (Proverbs 3:5-6), including how we use our time and talents, because, in the end, His ways are always higher than our own (Isaiah 55:8-9).\",\"series\":\"The Christian Life\"},\"15\":{\"title\":\"Origin of Evil\",\"url\":\"/gospel/evil/\",\"category\":\"Gospel\",\"description\":\"If God is in control, why is there so much evil in the world?

But when the blade was sprung up, and brought forth fruit, then appeared the tares also. So the servants of the householder came and said unto him, Sir, didst not thou sow good seed in thy field? from whence then hath it tares? He said unto them, An enemy hath done this.” —Matthew 13:24-28 God cannot be the originator of evil because that is contrary to His character of love. It was an enemy of God that was responsible for the birth of evil. What was Satan’s original name? “How art thou fallen from heaven, O Lucifer, son of the morning! how art thou cut down to the ground, which didst weaken the nations!” —Isaiah 14:12 Lucifer means “light bearer”, and he was one of God’s angels. Was Lucifer perfect when God created him? “Thou sealest up the sum, full of wisdom, and perfect in beauty. Thou hast been in Eden the garden of God; every precious stone was thy covering, the sardius, topaz, and the diamond, the beryl, the onyx, and the jasper, the sapphire, the emerald, and the carbuncle, and gold: the workmanship of thy tabrets and of thy pipes was prepared in thee in the day that thou wast created. Thou art the anointed cherub that covereth; and I have set thee so: thou wast upon the holy mountain of God; thou hast walked up and down in the midst of the stones of fire. Thou wast perfect in thy ways from the day that thou wast created, till iniquity was found in thee.” —Ezekiel 28:12-15 “The Lord reigneth; let the people tremble: he sitteth between the cherubims; let the earth be moved.” —Psalm 99:1 In Ezekiel 28 Lucifer is symbolized as the “prince of Tyre,” and we learn that he was created perfect. He was also a covering cherub, which means he had a high position in heaven and was next to God’s very presence. It’s unknown how long perfection existed in heaven, but eventually evil was born in Lucifer’s heart because he aall of God’s angels had freedom of choice. This is a risk God willingly took because genuine love cannot exist without a free will. How did he taint his heart? “By the multitude of thy merchandise they have filled the midst of thee with violence, and thou hast sinned: therefore I will cast thee as profane out of the mountain of God: and I will destroy thee, O covering cherub, from the midst of the stones of fire. Thine heart was lifted up because of thy beauty, thou hast corrupted thy wisdom by reason of thy brightness: I will cast thee to the ground, I will lay thee before kings, that they may behold thee.” —Ezekiel 28:16-17 “How art thou fallen from heaven, O Lucifer, son of the morning! how art thou cut down to the ground, which didst weaken the nations! For thou hast said in thine heart, I will ascend into heaven, I will exalt my throne above the stars of God: I will sit also upon the mount of the congregation, in the sides of the north: I will ascend above the heights of the clouds; I will be like the most High.” —Isaiah 14:12-14 Lucifer allowed his beauty to fill him with pride, and he started to envy God’s power, His throne, and the worship of the angels. Eventually, his goal was to unseat God. What did this lead to? “And there was war in heaven: Michael and his angels fought against the dragon; and the dragon fought and his angels, and prevailed not; neither was their place found any more in heaven.” —Revelation 12:7-8 “And he [Jesus] said unto them, I beheld Satan as lightning fall from heaven.” —Luke 10:18 Lucifer was able to convince other angels to join him in his rebellion, leading to war in heaven. God could have then destroyed him, but He did not want the remaining angels to worship Him out of fear, so He cast Lucifer out of heaven and gave him an opportunity to demonstrate what would be the result of sin and rebellion. Would it bring more prosperity and happiness than God’s form of government? Where did he end up? “And the great dragon was cast out, that old serpent, called the Devil, and Satan, which deceiveth the whole world: he was cast out into the earth, and his angels were cast out with him.” —Revelation 12:9 Earth is where Satan would have a chance to develop his own form of government. What did God do next? “So God created man in his own image, in the image of God created he him; male and female created he them. And God blessed them, and God said unto them, Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it: and have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth. ““And God said, Behold, I have given you every herb bearing seed, which is upon the face of all the earth, and every tree, in the which is the fruit of a tree yielding seed; to you it shall be for meat. And to every beast of the earth, and to every fowl of the air, and to every thing that creepeth upon the earth, wherein there is life, I have given every green herb for meat: and it was so. And God saw every thing that he had made, and, behold, it was very good. And the evening and the morning were the sixth day.” —Genesis 1:27-31 “And the LORD God took the man, and put him into the garden of Eden to dress it and to keep it. And the LORD God commanded the man, saying, Of every tree of the garden thou mayest freely eat: But of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not eat of it: for in the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die.” —Genesis 2:15-17 After losing some of His angels, God created a new order of beings after His own image. Adam and Eve were to be independent judges between the government of God and that of Satan since they did not witness the conflict in heaven. God gave them a perfect start, everything they needed for happiness and prosperity, but like His angels, they also had free will, and in order to be fair to Satan, God gave him access to them at the tree. What lie did Satan tell Eve that was an echo of Isaiah 14:14? “Now the serpent was more subtil than any beast of the field which the LORD God had made. And he said unto the woman, Yea, hath God said, Ye shall not eat of every tree of the garden? And the woman said unto the serpent, We may eat of the fruit of the trees of the garden: But of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden, God hath said, Ye shall not eat of it, neither shall ye touch it, lest ye die. And the serpent said unto the woman, Ye shall not surely die: For God doth know that in the day ye eat thereof, then your eyes shall be opened, and ye shall be as gods, knowing good and evil.” —Genesis 3:1-5 Satan used a serpent to deceive Eve and contradict God by telling her that not only would she not die if she ate the fruit, but she would also become like God, which is exactly what Satan himself desired in heaven. The implication was that God was holding her back from reaching her fullest potential, and Satan was actually the one who had her best interests in mind, not God. What happened instead? “And when the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that it was pleasant to the eyes, and a tree to be desired to make one wise, she took of the fruit thereof, and did eat, and gave also unto her husband with her; and he did eat. And the eyes of them both were opened, and they knew that they were naked; and they sewed fig leaves together, and made themselves aprons.” —Genesis 3:6-7 In order to deceive Eve, Satan mixed in some truth with his lie when he said she would know good and evil because now that they had sinned against God, Adam and Eve lost their innocence, and their eyes were indeed opened to shame, grief, suffering, pain, and death, but they did not ascend to a higher state of existence, as Satan had promised. It was not God’s will for them to know evil, but because Adam and Eve had chosen to believe Satan’s version of reality, he was now free to proceed with establishing his form of government on Earth. What does sin do? “And they heard the voice of the LORD God walking in the garden in the cool of the day: and Adam and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the LORD God amongst the trees of the garden.” —Genesis 3:8 “Behold, the LORD’S hand is not shortened, that it cannot save; neither his ear heavy, that it cannot hear: But your iniquities have separated between you and your God, and your sins have hid his face from you, that he will not hear.” —Isaiah 59:1-2 As soon as Adam and Eve sinned, they hid from God for the first time. Sin leads to separation from God because sin cannot exist in the presence of a holy God without being consumed by it. A chasm was now formed between the Giver of life and His creation, and the process of death had commenced. What did sin do to the human heart? “The heart is deceitful above all things, and desperately wicked; who can know it?” —Jeremiah 17:9 Once the human heart was corrupted with sin, the door was opened up to the influence of evil in all it’s forms. What does sin lead to? “For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.” —Romans 6:23 Sin leads to separation from the Giver of life, which leads to death. How many are subject to death? “Wherefore, as by one man sin entered into the world, and death by sin; and so death passed upon all men, for that all have sinned.” —Romans 5:12 “For all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God.” —Romans 3:23 Am I really free in my fallen condition? “Know ye not, that to whom ye yield yourselves servants to obey, his servants ye are to whom ye obey; whether of sin unto death, or of obedience unto righteousness?” —Romans 6:16 Ever since the fall, the human race no longer has true freedom and has become a slave to sin and, ultimately, to death. Is there hope of escaping death? “And I will put enmity between you and the woman, and between your seed and her Seed; He shall bruise your head, and you shall bruise His heel.” —Genesis 3:15, NKJV “Forasmuch then as the children are partakers of flesh and blood, he also himself likewise took part of the same; that through death he might destroy him that had the power of death, that is, the devil; And deliver them who through fear of death were all their lifetime subject to bondage. For verily he took not on him the nature of angels; but he took on him the seed of Abraham.Wherefore in all things it behoved him to be made like unto his brethren, that he might be a merciful and faithful high priest in things pertaining to God, to make reconciliation for the sins of the people.” —Hebrews 2:14-17 Once Adam and Eve fell, God did not leave them in their hopeless condition but gave them a promise that sin would not reign on earth forever. A Redeemer would come who would crush the head of Satan and break the power of sin and death over the human race by paying for their sins Himself. How can I escape death? “For if by one man’s offence death reigned by one; much more they which receive abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness shall reign in life by one, Jesus Christ. Therefore as by the offence of one judgment came upon all men to condemnation; even so by the righteousness of one the free gift came upon all men unto justification of life. For as by one man’s disobedience many were made sinners, so by the obedience of one shall many be made righteous.” —Romans 5:17-19 “Being justified freely by his grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus: Whom God hath set forth to be a propitiation through faith in his blood, to declare his righteousness for the remission of sins that are past, through the forbearance of God.” —Romans 3:24-25 Christ’s perfect life gives us the ability to be free from the bondage of sin and it’s penalty of death! By paying for our sins, Jesus made it possible for anyone who receives this free gift by faith through repentance of sins to be forgiven and declared righteous before God! What does God promise? “For I the LORD thy God will hold thy right hand, saying unto thee, Fear not; I will help thee.” —Isaiah 41:13 God in His love and mercy does not leave us in our hopeless condition. He gave His own Son to give us a way out of our predicament and eliminate the separation that occured between Him and the human race in the Garden of Eden. Will Satan live forever? “Thine heart was lifted up because of thy beauty, thou hast corrupted thy wisdom by reason of thy brightness: I will cast thee to the ground, I will lay thee before kings, that they may behold thee. Thou hast defiled thy sanctuaries by the multitude of thine iniquities, by the iniquity of thy traffick; therefore will I bring forth a fire from the midst of thee, it shall devour thee, and I will bring thee to ashes upon the earth in the sight of all them that behold thee.” —Ezekiel 28:17-18 What will God do once evil is eradicated? “And I saw a new heaven and a new earth: for the first heaven and the first earth were passed away; and there was no more sea. And I John saw the holy city, new Jerusalem, coming down from God out of heaven, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband. And I heard a great voice out of heaven saying, Behold, the tabernacle of God is with men, and he will dwell with them, and they shall be his people, and God himself shall be with them, and be their God. And God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes; and there shall be no more death, neither sorrow, nor crying, neither shall there be any more pain: for the former things are passed away. And he that sat upon the throne said, Behold, I make all things new. And he said unto me, Write: for these words are true and faithful.” —Revelation 21:1-5 There will come a day when Satan will be destroyed and his flawed kingdom will come to an end. It will be replaced by an earth that will be even more glorious than the Garden of Eden, and we will once again be able to talk to God face to face! Will evil rise again? “What do ye imagine against the LORD? he will make an utter end: affliction shall not rise up the second time.” —Nahum 1:9 “And one shall say unto him, What are these wounds in thine hands? Then He shall answer, Those with which I was wounded in the house of my friends.” —Zechariah 13:6 Sin and rebellion will never rise up again because the pierced hands of Jesus will be an eternal reminder of the evil results of sin.\",\"series\":\"The Great Controversy\"},\"16\":{\"title\":\"Walking in Faith\",\"url\":\"/gospel/faith/\",\"category\":\"Gospel\",\"description\":\"Faith is a central theme in the Bible, but what is it really? Does God want us to have blind faith?\",\"body\":\"What is faith? “Now faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen.” —Hebrews 11:1 Faith is what reaches out and grasps things not seen that are backed up by evidence. In Isaiah 1:18 God says, “Come now, and let us reason together,” which means He does not want anyone to blindly follow Him; on the contrary, He wants faith to be informed by evidence. Why is faith necessary? “But without faith it is impossible to please him: for he that cometh to God must believe that he is, and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him.” —Hebrews 11:6 Faith is the means by which my journey with Jesus starts. It is the hand of faith that reaches out to grasp the outstretched hand of God. He is always ready and eager to help those who come to Him, but I must first believe in Him and His goodness. This faith is based on plentiful evidence, but the evidence does not remove the need for faith altogether. There will always be room for doubt for those who want to doubt simply because the finite human mind cannot fully grasp an everlasting, infinite God. Thus the need for faith: God said it—I believe it. How many have faith? “For I say, through the grace given unto me, to every man that is among you, not to think of himself more highly than he ought to think; but to think soberly, according as God hath dealt to every man the measure of faith.” —Romans 12:3 Fatih is like a muscle; every person has been given a measure of it. Some neglect it, never use it, and it grows weak. Others act on what they have, reaching out to God, and He meets them where they are, revealing Himself to them, which in turn makes their faith stronger, and then they act on that, and it continues to grow each time it is used. What if my faith is weak? “And the apostles said unto the Lord, Increase our faith.” —Luke 17:5 “Jesus said unto him, If thou canst believe, all things are possible to him that believeth. And straightway the father of the child cried out, and said with tears, Lord, I believe; help thou mine unbelief.” —Mark 9:23-24 “Then came the disciples to Jesus apart, and said, Why could not we cast him out? And Jesus said unto them, Because of your unbelief: for verily I say unto you, If ye have faith as a grain of mustard seed, ye shall say unto this mountain, Remove hence to yonder place; and it shall remove; and nothing shall be impossible unto you.” —Matthew 17:19-20 Even if my faith is weak and small as a tiny seed, I can exercise the faith that I do have, and ask God to increase it, believing in His power to do so, and it will be done. What is faith based on? “So then faith cometh by hearing, and hearing by the word of God.” —Romans 10:17 “Another parable put he forth unto them, saying, The kingdom of heaven is like to a grain of mustard seed, which a man took, and sowed in his field: which indeed is the least of all seeds: but when it is grown, it is the greatest among herbs, and becometh a tree, so that the birds of the air come and lodge in the branches thereof.” —Matthew 13:31-32 Faith is primarily based on the evidence of truth revealed in the Word of God, the Bible. Like a seed that is watered by the rain, faith grows whenever it is watered with the truth of His Word and that truth is then internalized—received and allowed to take root in the heart. With our cooperation, God can take that small seed of faith and make it grow into a mature tree through His Word. What role does faith have in prayer? “And Jesus answering saith unto them, Have faith in God. For verily I say unto you, That whosoever shall say unto this mountain, Be thou removed, and be thou cast into the sea; and shall not doubt in his heart, but shall believe that those things which he saith shall come to pass; he shall have whatsoever he saith. Therefore I say unto you, What things soever ye desire, when ye pray, believe that ye receive them, and ye shall have them.” —Mark 11:22-24 “And when he was come into the house, the blind men came to him: and Jesus saith unto them, Believe ye that I am able to do this? They said unto him, Yea, Lord. Then touched he their eyes, saying, According to your faith be it unto you. And their eyes were opened.” —Matthew 9:28-30 “And this is the confidence that we have in him, that, if we ask any thing according to his will, he heareth us.” —1 John 5:14 “But let him ask in faith, with no doubting, for he who doubts is like a wave of the sea driven and tossed by the wind.” —James 1:6, NKJV My prayers are answered according to my faith, or confidence, in Jesus’ power and love, which I become aware of by exposing my mind and heart to His Word. The Bible says that I can be confident that any request that is in harmony with God’s will, as revealed in His Word, He hears. What is the power of the gospel dependent on? “For unto us was the gospel preached, as well as unto them: but the word preached did not profit them, not being mixed with faith in them that heard it.” —Hebrews 4:2 The gospel is the good news of God’s desire and power to save humanity from the misery of sin. When the gospel is mingled with faith, it is acted on and received into the mind and heart, starting a marvelous process of transformation in the life of the receiver through the power of God. How do I inherit the promises of God? “That ye be not slothful, but followers of them who through faith and patience inherit the promises.” —Hebrews 6:12 “These all died in faith, not having received the promises, but having seen them afar off, and were persuaded of them, and embraced them, and confessed that they were strangers and pilgrims on the earth. For they that say such things declare plainly that they seek a country. And truly, if they had been mindful of that country from whence they came out, they might have had opportunity to have returned. But now they desire a better country, that is, an heavenly: wherefore God is not ashamed to be called their God: for he hath prepared for them a city.” —Hebrews 11:13-16 How is faith linked with forgiveness? “And when he saw their faith, he said unto him, Man, thy sins are forgiven thee.” —Luke 5:20 The Bible shows God is willing to forgive anyone who is truly repentant. When this evidence is acted on by faith, when I take God at His Word, He will forgive me too, just like He forgave the paralytic according to his faith. How important is faith in salvation? “For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God: not of works, lest any man should boast.” —Ephesians 2:8-9 Salvation is only through faith. I am made righteous by faith in Jesus’ love as expressed in His willingness to forgive my sins and clothe me with His righteousness. I am also sanctified by faith in His power to save me from my sins. Salvation is completely of God; it is a gift. Faith is the means by which I reach out to Him and recieve that gift. Whose faith came to my rescue? “I am crucified with Christ: nevertheless I live; yet not I, but Christ liveth in me: and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God, who loved me, and gave himself for me.” —Galatians 2:20 I am alive because of the perfect faith of Jesus, who opened the way of salvation for me. What is evident in those who are saved by faith? “By whom [Jesus] we have received grace and apostleship, for obedience to the faith among all nations, for his name.” —Romans 1:5 “Here is the patience of the saints: here are they that keep the commandments of God, and the faith of Jesus.” —Revelation 14:12 Those who have the faith of Jesus also keep the commandments of God because Jesus Himself kept them. In the book of Romans Paul says Jesus gives us grace for obedience to the faith. Now it is true that I am saved by faith alone, but it is also true that once I am saved by Jesus, my love for Him leads me to obey Him. Obedience is the result of salvation, not the means to it. It can only be born out of love for the One who died for me, and it is made possible by His grace working in me. Is there more evidence of this? “Even so faith, if it hath not works, is dead, being alone. Yea, a man may say, Thou hast faith, and I have works: shew me thy faith without thy works, and I will shew thee my faith by my works. Thou believest that there is one God; thou doest well: the devils also believe, and tremble. But wilt thou know, O vain man, that faith without works is dead?” —James 2:17-20 “Do men gather grapes of thorns, or figs of thistles? Even so every good tree bringeth forth good fruit; but a corrupt tree bringeth forth evil fruit. … Wherefore by their fruits ye shall know them. Not every one that saith unto me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of heaven; but he that doeth the will of my Father which is in heaven. Many will say to me in that day, Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied in thy name? and in thy name have cast out devils? and in thy name done many wonderful works? And then will I profess unto them, I never knew you: depart from me, ye that work iniquity.” —Matthew 7:16-17, 20-23 Obedience shows the genuineness of my faith. Put another way, my faith is confirmed, or justified, to me by my works. They are evidence for me, not God, since He already knows my genuine heart (Psalm 139:1-4), but I do need the evidence because it’s easy to deceive myself about my true condition (Jeremiah 17:9-10). What is the counterfeit to faith? “Then the devil taketh him up into the holy city, and setteth him on a pinnacle of the temple, and saith unto him, If thou be the Son of God, cast thyself down: for it is written, He shall give his angels charge concerning thee: and in their hands they shall bear thee up, lest at any time thou dash thy foot against a stone. Jesus said unto him, It is written again, Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God.” —Matthew 4:5-7 “Behold, I give unto you power to tread on serpents and scorpions, and over all the power of the enemy: and nothing shall by any means hurt you.” —Luke 10:19 The counterfeit of faith is presumption, which tends to put God to the test under contrived and unnatural circumstances, often for selfish motives. Satan tempted Jesus to cast Himself down to prove His divinity by perverting a promise from Psalm 91:12, but this promise wasn not made for deliberate, voluntary, self-created dangers. Even though Jesus gave His disciples power over serpents and scorpions, they were not supposed to go looking for them intentionally to prove their faith. How do I overcome? “For whatsoever is born of God overcometh the world: and this is the victory that overcometh the world, even our faith.” —1 John 5:4 Those who have faith in God’s power not only to forgive their sins, but also to save them from their sins will be victorious!\",\"series\":\"Experiencing Salvation\"},\"17\":{\"title\":\"Receiving Forgiveness\",\"url\":\"/gospel/forgiveness/\",\"category\":\"Gospel\",\"description\":\"Confession and forgiveness of sins is central to the plan of salvation.

He retaineth not his anger for ever, because he delighteth in mercy.

I go from running away from God toward sin to running away from sin toward God. If I repent and have a desire to leave my sins behind, the promise is I will receive forgiveness. How many sins is God willing to cleanse me from? “If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.” —1 John 1:9 God will never refuse to forgive a person who is truly sorry and genuinely asks Him for forgiveness. How does God want me to live after I’ve been forgiven? “When Jesus had lifted up himself, and saw none but the woman, he said unto her, Woman, where are those thine accusers? hath no man condemned thee? She said, No man, Lord. And Jesus said unto her, Neither do I condemn thee: go, and sin no more.” —John 8:10-11 Jesus doesn’t just want to forgive my sins; He wants to cleanse me from my sins and restore His image in me by transforming my life. How can He give me victory over all of my sins? “Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and ye shall find; knock, and it shall be opened unto you: for every one that asketh receiveth; and he that seeketh findeth; and to him that knocketh it shall be opened.” —Matthew 7:7-8 “And this is the confidence that we have in him, that, if we ask any thing according to his will, he heareth us.” —1 John 5:14 “What shall we then say to these things? If God be for us, who can be against us? He that spared not His own Son, but delivered Him up for us all, how shall He not with Him also freely give us all things?” —Romans 8:31-32 There is no sin too powerful for God, but He cannot do anything against my will either. If I confess my sins and ask Him to give me victory over them, believing that He is powerful enough to do it, He will do it according to my faith. What promise does He give me? “Then will I sprinkle clean water upon you, and ye shall be clean: from all your filthiness, and from all your idols, will I cleanse you. A new heart also will I give you, and a new spirit will I put within you: and I will take away the stony heart out of your flesh, and I will give you an heart of flesh. And I will put my spirit within you, and cause you to walk in my statutes, and ye shall keep my judgments, and do them.” —Ezekiel 36:25-27 “He will turn again, he will have compassion upon us; he will subdue our iniquities; and thou wilt cast all their sins into the depths of the sea.” —Micah 7:19 God wants to free me from the power of sin because sin hurts me. He can also give me the power to be free because I cannot change myself, just like a leopard cannot change his spots, but He can! He promises to give a new heart and a new spirit to those who ask Him. Why can I receive forgiveness? “I have blotted out, as a thick cloud, thy transgressions, and, as a cloud, thy sins: return unto me; for I have redeemed thee.” —Isaiah 44:22 Who ended up paying for my sins? “Who hath delivered us from the power of darkness, and hath translated us into the kingdom of his dear Son: in whom we have redemption through his blood, even the forgiveness of sins.” —Colossians 1:13-14 I can be forgiven because Christ already paid for my sins on the cross and redeemed me from them. All I have to do is ask. Will He remember my sins once I ask for forgiveness? “I, even I, am he that blotteth out thy transgressions for mine own sake, and will not remember thy sins.” —Isaiah 43:25 What does the Bible say about those who’ve been forgiven? “Blessed is he whose transgression is forgiven, whose sin is covered.” —Psalm 32:1 Could receiving forgiveness affect my health? “Bless the LORD, O my soul, and forget not all his benefits: who forgiveth all thine iniquities; who healeth all thy diseases; who redeemeth thy life from destruction; who crowneth thee with lovingkindness and tender mercies; who satisfieth thy mouth with good things; so that thy youth is renewed like the eagle’s.” —Psalm 103:2-5 Carrying feelings of guilt is not good for my health, but knowing I’ve been forgiven can bring both physical and mental healing. But what if I’m guilty of many sins? “This is a faithful saying, and worthy of all acceptation, that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners; of whom I am chief.” —1 Timothy 1:15 “Wherefore I say unto thee, her sins, which are many, are forgiven, for she loved much: but to whom little is forgiven, the same loveth little.” —Luke 7:47 Every sin which I genuinely repent of and confess to Christ wil be forgiven. Does God want me to forgive others once He has forgiven me? “And be ye kind one to another, tenderhearted, forgiving one another, even as God for Christ’s sake hath forgiven you.” —Ephesians 4:32 “Now instead, you ought to forgive and comfort him, so that he will not be overwhelmed by excessive sorrow. I urge you, therefore, to reaffirm your love for him. Another reason I wrote you was to see if you would stand the test and be obedient in everything.” —2 Corinthians 2:7-9, NIV Forgiving others and giving the matter over to Jesus also lightens my own burden.\",\"series\":\"Experiencing Salvation\"},\"18\":{\"title\":\"What Is God Like?\",\"url\":\"/gospel/god/\",\"category\":\"Gospel\",\"description\":\"The amount of misconceptions and flat out lies about God is astounding. What is the truth about His character?\",\"body\":\"Is God triune? “For there are three that bear record in heaven, the Father, the Word, and the Holy Ghost: and these three are one.” —1 John 5:7 “Go ye therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost.” —Matthew 28:19 “How much more shall the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered himself without spot to God, purge your conscience from dead works to serve the living God?” —Hebrews 9:14 The Godhead consists of three distinct persons: God the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy Spirit. Though distinct, they are one in nature, character, purpose, and will. In this article, when I use the term God, I am referring specifically to the Father, because Scripture presents Him as holding the highest authority within the Godhead (John 14:28), though the term is equally appropriate for the Son and the Holy Spirit. The Father’s position of highest authority indicates a hierarchy within the Godhead. For example, the Father sent the Son (John 17:3), and both the Father and the Son send the Holy Spirit (John 14:26; 15:26), yet the Holy Spirit does not send the Father or the Son. This order reflects voluntary, loving submission, not inequality, for the Son and the Holy Spirit are not coerced, nor is their divinity diminished in any way. All three are fully and equally God. A similar hierarchy exists among the angels and within both the church and the family, with Christ as the head of the church and the husband as the head of the household (Ephesians 5:23). Does God have a beginning or end? “Before the mountains were brought forth, or ever thou hadst formed the earth and the world, even from everlasting to everlasting, thou art God.” —Psalm 90:2 “I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the ending, saith the LORD, which is, and which was, and which is to come, the Almighty.” —Revelation 1:8 It may be hard for our finite minds to comprehend—especially since none of us are exempt from death—but God is infinite; He always has been and always will be. What belongs to God? “The earth is the LORD’S, and the fulness thereof; the world, and they that dwell therein.” —Psalm 24:1 “What? know ye not that your body is the temple of the Holy Ghost which is in you, which ye have of God, and ye are not your own? For ye are bought with a price: therefore glorify God in your body, and in your spirit, which are God’s.” —1 Corinthians 6:19-20 “But now thus saith the LORD that created thee, O Jacob, and he that formed thee, O Israel, Fear not: for I have redeemed thee, I have called thee by thy name; thou art mine. When thou passest through the waters, I will be with thee; and through the rivers, they shall not overflow thee: when thou walkest through the fire, thou shalt not be burned; neither shall the flame kindle upon thee. For I am the LORD thy God, the Holy One of Israel, thy Saviour.” —Isaiah 43:1-3 Everything belongs to God first and foremost by creation, for nothing created itself. Humans belong to God both by creation and by redemption, for Jesus paid the price for our sin, thereby redeeming us from the power of death. In other words, we are doubly His: first because He gave us life, and second because He rescued us from certain death. Because He created us, He cares for us as a loving Father cares for His children. It may be astonishing—or even difficult to grasp—that the Creator and King of the universe cares for each of us personally, but it is absolutely true. When we feel abandoned or neglected, He sees us and is with us (Isaiah 40:27-31; 41:10). He keeps our hearts beating, provides for our needs, and has a solution for every crisis (Acts 17:28; Matthew 6:26; 10:29-31; 2 Chronicles 16:9). No matter the time or place, He is always only a prayer away (Jeremiah 29:11-13). Is God omnipotent? “And all the inhabitants of the earth are reputed as nothing: and he doeth according to his will in the army of heaven, and among the inhabitants of the earth: and none can stay his hand, or say unto him, What doest thou?” —Daniel 4:35 “And he changeth the times and the seasons: he removeth kings, and setteth up kings: he giveth wisdom unto the wise, and knowledge to them that know understanding.” —Daniel 2:21 “Ah Lord GOD! behold, thou hast made the heaven and the earth by thy great power and stretched out arm, and there is nothing too hard for thee.” —Jeremiah 32:17 “I know that, whatsoever God doeth, it shall be for ever: nothing can be put to it, nor any thing taken from it: and God doeth it, that men should fear before him.” —Ecclesiastes 3:14 God is omnipotent, yet He is not a tyrant; on the contrary, He sacrifices Himself for His creation. He carries out His will through His Word, which possesses creative power to accomplish what He declares (Numbers 23:19; Isaiah 55:11). His desire for Adam and Eve was that their descendants would inherit the earth as an everlasting possession (Genesis 17:8; 48:4), and although this has been delayed because of sin and death, it will ultimately be fulfilled (Psalm 37:11; Matthew 5:5; Revelation 7:9-10)—at immeasurable cost to Himself—for His Word cannot fail. Remarkably, God brings His purposes to completion without violating anyone’s free will: all who desire to become His sons and daughters will inherit the land first given to Adam and Eve, reaffirmed to Abraham, and secured in Christ (Genesis 1:26-28; 15:5-7; Galatians 3:16, 29; John 1:12-13). Does He make mistakes? “As for God, his way is perfect: the word of the LORD is tried: he is a buckler to all those that trust in him.” —Psalm 18:30 “He is the Rock, his work is perfect: for all his ways are judgment: a God of truth and without iniquity, just and right is he.” —Deuteronomy 32:4 “The LORD is righteous in all his ways, and holy in all his works.” —Psalm 145:17 Because God does not make mistakes, every human He created—from the moment of conception—matters, has a purpose, and is cherished (Isaiah 49:1; Jeremiah 1:5). Despite the widespread acceptance of Darwin’s ill-conceived “survival of the fittest” theory, there is no such thing as an expendable or inferior person—much less a group of people. This truth has profound implications for how we treat others as a society and as individuals—from those closest to us, to our enemies, to the unborn, to the homeless. Justice and law must always be respected, but even criminals deserve to be treated with human dignity. On a personal level, no matter how negatively we may feel about ourselves or the direction our life has taken, God is in the work of bringing healing, restoration, and freedom where there is brokenness, despair, and bondage (Psalm 147:3; Joel 2:25-26; Isaiah 43:18-19; 61:1-3; Ezekiel 37:4-6). The more hopeless the case, the stronger His desire to help. Can we fully comprehend Him? “Canst thou by searching find out God? canst thou find out the Almighty unto perfection? It is as high as heaven; what canst thou do? deeper than hell; what canst thou know? The measure thereof is longer than the earth, and broader than the sea.” —Job 11:7-9 “Have you not known? Have you not heard? The everlasting God, the LORD, The Creator of the ends of the earth, Neither faints nor is weary. His understanding is unsearchable.” —Isaiah 40:28 “Now faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen.” —Hebrews 11:1 A finite human mind cannot comprehend the infinite God. At the same time, He has not left us to walk in blind ignorance but has revealed everything we need to know about Him—first and foremost in His Word. Yet that is not all, for we can also learn about Him through the things He has made. The starry skies, the breathtaking landscapes, and the plant and animal kingdoms all give us glimpses of their Maker. We are saved by faith, but He does not expect us to operate on blind faith, for He has given us abundant evidence on which to base our belief. In fact, it often takes more faith to accept human theories than to trust the biblical record. Even so, the need for faith is never removed entirely, for those who wish to doubt will always find room to do so. After all, apart from the thirty-three years of Christ’s earthly life, God has been—and still is—unseen. Yet His fingerprints are everywhere, not only in nature, but also in the Bible’s divine design, especially in the prophecies that foretell events thousands of years in advance. His providence—His guiding hand—in the history of nations, in the story of His church, and in the lives of individuals likewise testifies that He is deeply invested in and actively involved with humanity. According to Revelation 18:1, just before the second coming of Christ, the world will see a visible manifestation of God’s character (His glory) in the lives of His followers. In Matthew 16:18, Jesus declared that the gates of hell would not prevail against His church. Consider that He entrusted the establishment of His church to a small group of twelve disciples, who faced intense persecution from the Jewish authorities; that their converts would then endure the persecutions of the Roman Empire; and that, during the Dark Ages, much of the Christian church would apostatize and even persecute those who refused to compromise the pure faith. What, then, are the chances that a remnant of His church would still exist two thousand years later if it were not for His providence? Is God omniscient? “Great is our Lord, and of great power: his understanding is infinite.” —Psalm 147:5 “Dost thou know the balancings of the clouds, the wondrous works of him which is perfect in knowledge?” —Job 37:16 “For if our heart condemn us, God is greater than our heart, and knoweth all things.” —1 John 3:20 God is omniscient in the fullest sense of the word. Does God know my thoughts? “O LORD, thou hast searched me, and known me. Thou knowest my downsitting and mine uprising, thou understandest my thought afar off. Thou compassest [comprehend] my path and my lying down, and art acquainted with all my ways. For there is not a word in my tongue, but, lo, O LORD, thou knowest it altogether.” —Psalm 139:1-4 “And thou, Solomon my son, know thou the God of thy father, and serve him with a perfect heart and with a willing mind: for the LORD searcheth all hearts, and understandeth all the imaginations of the thoughts: if thou seek him, he will be found of thee; but if thou forsake him, he will cast thee off for ever.” —1 Chronicles 28:9 “I the LORD search the heart, I try the reins, even to give every man according to his ways, and according to the fruit of his doings.” —Jeremiah 17:10 As our Creator, God knows us better than we know ourselves. Just as there is no sin in our lives that God does not see, so there is no sorrow that He does not notice. He is acquainted with it all—every wound, disappointment, injustice, and abuse. Yet He is not merely aware; He longs to heal our wounds (Isaiah 53:5; Jeremiah 30:17; 33:6), restore what was lost (Isaiah 43:18-19; 51:3; Joel 2:25), comfort our sorrows (Psalm 147:3; Isaiah 57:18), make right every wrong (Romans 12:19), forgive every confessed sin (Psalm 103:2-4; 1 John 1:9), cleanse every defilement (Ezekiel 36:25), and set us free from every addiction (Luke 4:18). He who created the heavens and the earth by the power of His Word (Genesis 1:1; Psalm 33:6) has the same power to recreate us by that same Word (1 Peter 1:23; 2 Corinthians 5:17), the Bible, but only if we let Him (Revelation 3:20). Does God know the future? “Remember the former things of old: for I am God, and there is none else; I am God, and there is none like me, declaring the end from the beginning, and from ancient times the things that are not yet done, saying, My counsel shall stand, and I will do all my pleasure.” —Isaiah 46:9-10 “Surely the Lord GOD will do nothing, but he revealeth his secret unto his servants the prophets.” —Amos 3:7 “My frame was not hidden from You, when I was made in secret, and skillfully wrought in the lowest parts of the earth. Your eyes saw my substance, being yet unformed. And in Your book they all were written, the days fashioned for me, when as yet there were none of them.” —Psalm 139:15-16, NKJV “Before I formed thee in the belly I knew thee; and before thou camest forth out of the womb I sanctified thee, and I ordained thee a prophet unto the nations.” —Jeremiah 1:5 Not only does God know the future, but He also reveals it beforehand—to strengthen our faith in Him and to prepare us for what is to come. The Bible is full of prophecy for this very reason. But God’s foreknowledge has a personal dimension as well, for He knows our individual futures and prepares and equips us to face whatever trials may come our way. More than that, He walks with us through them (Isaiah 43:1-2), just as He walked through the fiery furnace with the three Hebrew worthies (Daniel 3:22-25), and just as He was in the boat with His disciples during the storm on the sea (Mark 4:37-40). As long as Jesus was with them, they were safe, for it was impossible for Him who made the sea to perish in it. When storms come into our own lives, we can rest in the promise that He will never allow us to be tempted beyond what we can bear (1 Corinthians 10:13), and that whatever He does allow, He will ultimately work out for our good (Romans 8:28). Waggoner, E. J. “Carest Thou Not That We Perish?” The Signs of the Times, vol. 17, no. 38, 21 Sept. 1891. What comfort does this bring? “Forasmuch as ye know that ye were not redeemed with corruptible things, as silver and gold, from your vain conversation received by tradition from your fathers; but with the precious blood of Christ, as of a lamb without blemish and without spot: who verily was foreordained before the foundation of the world, but was manifest in these last times for you.” —1 Peter 1:18-20 “And all that dwell upon the earth shall worship him, whose names are not written in the book of life of the Lamb slain from the foundation of the world.” —Revelation 13:8 “Who hath saved us, and called us with a holy calling, not according to our works, but according to his own purpose and grace, which was given us in Christ Jesus before the world began, but is now made manifest by the appearing of our Saviour Jesus Christ, who hath abolished death, and hath brought life and immortality to light through the gospel:” —2 Timothy 1:9-10 Because God is never caught off guard by any development, Satan’s rebellion in heaven was doomed from the start (Ezekiel 28:17-19), for God foresaw it and was prepared for it. He was likewise prepared for humanity’s fall, for Peter writes that Christ “was foreordained before the foundation of the world” (1 Peter 1:18-20), meaning that before Adam and Eve sinned, Christ had already offered Himself as their surety. This is the good news of the gospel, because no matter how unconquerable sin, evil, and death may now appear, God’s righteousness, love, and life will ultimately triumph (1 Corinthians 15:54-57). Does God predestine who is saved? “I call heaven and earth to record this day against you, that I have set before you life and death, blessing and cursing: therefore choose life, that both thou and thy seed may live: that thou mayest love the LORD thy God, and that thou mayest obey his voice, and that thou mayest cleave unto him: for he is thy life, and the length of thy days: that thou mayest dwell in the land which the LORD sware unto thy fathers, to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, to give them.” —Deuteronomy 30:19-20 “And if it seem evil unto you to serve the LORD, choose you this day whom ye will serve; whether the gods which your fathers served that were on the other side of the flood, or the gods of the Amorites, in whose land ye dwell: but as for me and my house, we will serve the LORD.” —Joshua 24:15 “And Elijah came unto all the people, and said, How long halt ye between two opinions? if the LORD be God, follow him: but if Baal, then follow him. And the people answered him not a word.” —1 Kings 18:21 God’s foreknowledge does not negate anyone’s freedom of choice. He respects free will, even when He knows it will cost Him everything; after all, He knew Satan would rebel against Him, yet He still created him. Why? Because God is love, and a foundational element of love is freedom of choice—freedom that always carries the risk that the one being loved may choose not to reciprocate. Love is often expressed most vividly under trying circumstances. If God had created only angels whom He knew would remain loyal to Him, He would have limited Himself to a love that lacked depth—one that had never been “tried in the fire.” And a shallow expression of love can awaken only the same love in return. But God desires to reveal a love that “passeth knowledge” (Ephesians 3:19). Satan’s fall provided God an opportunity to display a love—by offering His Son for the sins of a rebellious world—that would never have been possible otherwise. This love, in turn, awakens a far greater love and devotion, not only from the redeemed human race but also from the angels who remained loyal to Him. God’s respect for freedom of choice dismantles the idea of predestination—of God predetermining who will be saved or lost. Imagine a pilot flying over a long, dark, one-way tunnel as two cars enter from opposite ends—both without headlights. The pilot knows disaster will soon follow, but his foreknowledge in no way impedes or imposes itself upon the drivers’ choice to enter that tunnel. Predestination is a dangerous teaching because it can lead people to live as though their decisions and actions do not matter, believing their destiny has already been determined. Scripture, however, teaches the exact opposite: our words and actions do matter, for we will be held accountable for them (Matthew 12:36; Romans 14:12; Revelation 22:12). Jacobus Arminius was a 16th-century Dutch Reformer who rediscovered the biblical teaching of free will, now known as Arminianism. He rejected both the Calvinist doctrine of predestination and the idea that all will ultimately be saved (Universalism). Is He the source of all wisdom? “And he changeth the times and the seasons: he removeth kings, and setteth up kings: he giveth wisdom unto the wise, and knowledge to them that know understanding.” —Daniel 2:21 “If any of you lacks wisdom, let him ask of God, who gives to all liberally and without reproach, and it will be given to him.” —James 1:5, NKJV “For the LORD giveth wisdom: out of his mouth cometh knowledge and understanding.” —Proverbs 2:6 After Adam and Eve ate from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, humanity became exposed to the knowledge of evil—with all its pain, misery, and suffering—which was never God’s design. Yet even all genuinely good human wisdom is not inherently ours, but His—a profound truth that removes any temptation to glory in ourselves (2 Corinthians 10:17; Galatians 6:14). How many gods are there? “Tell ye, and bring them near; yea, let them take counsel together: who hath declared this from ancient time? who hath told it from that time? have not I the LORD? and there is no God else beside me; a just God and a Saviour; there is none beside me.” —Isaiah 45:21 “To whom then will ye liken me, or shall I be equal? saith the Holy One. Lift up your eyes on high, and behold who hath created these things, that bringeth out their host by number: he calleth them all by names by the greatness of his might, for that he is strong in power; not one faileth.” —Isaiah 40:25-26 “What profiteth the graven image that the maker thereof hath graven it; the molten image, and a teacher of lies, that the maker of his work trusteth therein, to make dumb idols? Woe unto him that saith to the wood, Awake; to the dumb stone, Arise, it shall teach! Behold, it is laid over with gold and silver, and there is no breath at all in the midst of it. But the LORD is in his holy temple: let all the earth keep silence before him.” —Habakkuk 2:18-20 “Neither is there salvation in any other: for there is none other name under heaven given among men, whereby we must be saved.” —Acts 4:12 There are countless gods across the world’s religions, but the Bible declares that there is only one true God, that there is salvation in no other, and that one fallen angel—Satan—wages war against Him for the worship of humanity. Though Satan aspires to be like God (Isaiah 14:12-14), he is—and will always remain—a created being (Ezekiel 28:15). Since Satan especially covets the worship that belongs to God alone (though not His character, interestingly enough), it is unsurprising that, just before the second coming of Christ, the great test that will divide all humanity into two groups will revolve around worship. God’s exclusive claim to divinity completely extinguishes the idea that mankind possesses inherent divinity or could attain it through practices such as yoga, mantra recitation, energy healing, or various Eastern meditation techniques. We are—and always will be—created beings. God does promise to bestow His character upon His followers (and what an honor that is), but we will never be divine—not even in heaven. The redeemed will live forever in heaven, not because they are immortal, but because God, who alone is immortal (1 Timothy 6:15-16), sustains their life. God’s declaration that He is the only true God may seem politically incorrect in an ecumenical world trending toward unity among religions. After all, what gives Him the right to make such a bold and exclusive claim? What sets the Christian God apart from all other gods is the fact that Jesus is the only One who died for His creation. What other god set aside his divine nature, took on the nature of his created beings, and died at their hands and for their sins? There is only One. How did God create the universe? “By the word of the LORD were the heavens made; and all the host of them by the breath of his mouth. He gathereth the waters of the sea together as an heap: he layeth up the depth in storehouses. Let all the earth fear the LORD: let all the inhabitants of the world stand in awe of him. For he spake, and it was done; he commanded, and it stood fast.” —Psalm 33:6-9 “Through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of God, so that things which are seen were not made of things which do appear.” —Hebrews 11:3 “For this they willingly are ignorant of, that by the word of God the heavens were of old, and the earth standing out of the water and in the water.” —2 Peter 3:5 All God had to do was speak, and immediately atoms came into existence and cells formed in obedience to His Word, for His Word possesses creative power. Because God never changes (Malachi 3:6), Jesus’ earthly life revealed that He had—and still has—the same power over creation (Mark 4:39) as when He spoke it into existence (Colossians 1:16; John 1:1-3). Does He still create by His Word? “Husbands, love your wives, even as Christ also loved the church, and gave himself for it; that he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of water by the word, that he might present it to himself a glorious church, not having spot, or wrinkle, or any such thing; but that it should be holy and without blemish.” —Ephesians 5:25-27 “Of his own will begat he us with the word of truth, that we should be a kind of firstfruits of his creatures.” —James 1:18 “Seeing ye have purified your souls in obeying the truth through the Spirit unto unfeigned love of the brethren, see that ye love one another with a pure heart fervently: being born again, not of corruptible seed, but of incorruptible, by the word of God, which liveth and abideth for ever. For all flesh is as grass, and all the glory of man as the flower of grass. The grass withereth, and the flower thereof falleth away: but the word of the Lord endureth for ever. And this is the word which by the gospel is preached unto you.” —1 Peter 1:22-25 The same creative power that spoke the worlds into existence out of nothing is still at work to speak His righteousness into existence in us—out of nothing—for we have no righteousness of our own (Isaiah 64:6). God’s power never changes; therefore, He exercises that same creative power in the re-creation of His image in us through the Holy Spirit (Titus 3:4-7), as we take hold of His promises by faith, especially those expressed in His Ten Commandments. Why are the Ten Commandments promises? Because God knows that we have no power to keep them. The truth is He requires only that which He already gives. This is why He begins the Decalogue with the declaration that He is the Lord who delivered us out of bondage—bondage to sin. This is a fact, a finished work (John 19:30), for Christ overcame sin—our sins—in human flesh—our flesh (Philippians 2:7-8; Hebrews 4:15). Do we believe it? After this opening declaration, God proceeds to spell out what His deliverance means in practical terms by giving us ten promises. In essence He says, “Because I have already delivered you—in Christ—from the bondage of sin, you will no longer have other gods before Me, nor worship idols, nor take My name in vain by living hypocritically; you will keep My Sabbath holy and honor your parents; you will not kill, nor commit adultery, nor steal, nor lie, nor covet.” Do we believe Him? This is the gospel proclaimed in the Ten Commandments, to be received by faith alone. “You are not to read or hear the word of God, and say, I must do that, I will do that. You are to open the heart to that word, that it may accomplish the will of God in you. It is not you who are to do it, but it. “It,” the word of God itself, is to do it, and you are to let it. “Let the word of Christ dwell in you.” This is stated in another place thus: “When ye receive the word of God which ye heard of us, ye received it not as the word of men, but as it is in truth, the word of God, which effectually worketh also in you that believe.” Thus it is the word of God that must work in you. You are not to work to do the word of God: the word of God is to work in you to cause you to do. “Whereunto I also labor, striving according to his working, which worketh in me mightily.”” —A. T. Jones & E. J. Waggoner, Lessons on Faith, p. 104. How is God glorified? “The heavens declare the glory of God; the skies proclaim the work of his hands. Day after day they pour forth speech; night after night they reveal knowledge.” —Psalm 19:1-2, NIV “If ye abide in me, and my words abide in you, ye shall ask what ye will, and it shall be done unto you. Herein is my Father glorified, that ye bear much fruit; so shall ye be my disciples.” —John 15:7-8 “But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, long-suffering, gentleness, goodness, faith, meekness, temperance: against such there is no law.” —Galatians 5:22-23 “The Spirit of the Lord GOD is upon me; because the LORD hath anointed me to preach good tidings unto the meek; he hath sent me to bind up the brokenhearted, to proclaim liberty to the captives, and the opening of the prison to them that are bound; to proclaim the acceptable year of the LORD, and the day of vengeance of our God; to comfort all that mourn; to appoint unto them that mourn in Zion, to give unto them beauty for ashes, the oil of joy for mourning, the garment of praise for the spirit of heaviness; that they might be called trees of righteousness, the planting of the LORD, that he might be glorified.” —Isaiah 61:1-3 God is glorified through the marvelous works of His creation: the awe-inspiring sunset, the starry skies on a clear night, the fragrant meadow filled with colorful flowers, the majestic snow-capped mountains, the birds singing their cheerful songs, and yes—the people once marred by sin who have permitted God to completely transform their characters so that they reflect His—the most magnificent wonder of all. What is His character like? “And we have known and believed the love that God hath to us. God is love; and he that dwelleth in love dwelleth in God, and God in him.” —1 John 4:16 “The LORD hath appeared of old unto me, saying, Yea, I have loved thee with an everlasting love: therefore with lovingkindness have I drawn thee.” —Jeremiah 31:3 “And the LORD passed by before him, and proclaimed, The LORD, The LORD God, merciful and gracious, longsuffering, and abundant in goodness and truth, keeping mercy for thousands, forgiving iniquity and transgression and sin, and that will by no means clear the guilty; visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children, and upon the children’s children, unto the third and to the fourth generation.” —Exodus 34:6-7 “To declare, I say, at this time his righteousness: that he might be just, and the justifier of him which believeth in Jesus.” —Romans 3:26 God is love, yet He is also perfectly just. He does not clear the guilty nor overlook sin, but takes that guilt and sin upon Himself, offering the sinner a second chance (John 8:11). He is patient, yet not indulgent—willing to chasten as a loving Father would, always for our eternal good. Never one to use force or coercion, He gently draws us into a relationship with Him, yet He honors our freedom if we continually resist. His mercy does not distinguish between the just and the unjust, and He pours out His blessings even on those who deserve them least (Psalm 145:9; Matthew 5:45; Romans 5:8). He is our heavenly Father who risked everything to spend eternity with His beloved sons and daughters. But because He is also just, all who refuse His free offer of life in Christ must bear the consequence of their sin—the forfeiture of their lives—for the wages of sin is death (Romans 6:23). Yet this is not God’s desire for anyone, for Christ has already borne this death on our behalf! It bears emphasizing: the wages of sin is death—not eternal torment in hell for a brief life of sin, nor a continuation of life as a disembodied spirit. This death includes both the first and the second death, because all the dead, whether saved or lost, will be resurrected again. The saved will be resurrected at Christ’s second coming, never to die again, while the lost will be resurrected at the end of the millennium for God’s final judgment. How faithful is He? “Let your conversation be without covetousness; and be content with such things as ye have: for he hath said, I will never leave thee, nor forsake thee.” —Hebrews 13:5 “Can a woman forget her sucking child, that she should not have compassion on the son of her womb? yea, they may forget, yet will I not forget thee. Behold, I have graven thee upon the palms of my hands.” —Isaiah 49:15-16 “That Christ may dwell in your hearts by faith; that ye, being rooted and grounded in love, may be able to comprehend with all saints what is the breadth, and length, and depth, and height; and to know the love of Christ, which passeth knowledge, that ye might be filled with all the fulness of God.” —Ephesians 3:17-19 It is often said that the bond between a mother and her child is the strongest human bond there is, but God’s love for each of us is even stronger—far beyond what we can imagine. For this reason, all who are saved will be saved not because of anything they accomplish, but because they give the power of God’s love free rein to work and be manifested in their lives. All who commit themselves to Him—daily choosing His will over their own (Luke 22:42; 1 Corinthians 15:31)—He will faithfully keep in His care, as He cleanses and transforms their character to reflect His own (Philippians 1:6; Hebrews 12:2; Jude 1:24). Will His name ever cease to be blessed? “Praise ye the LORD. Praise, O ye servants of the LORD, praise the name of the LORD. Blessed be the name of the LORD from this time forth and for evermore. From the rising of the sun unto the going down of the same the LORD’S name is to be praised. The LORD is high above all nations, and his glory above the heavens. Who is like unto the LORD our God, who dwelleth on high, who humbleth himself to behold the things that are in heaven, and in the earth! He raiseth up the poor out of the dust, and lifteth the needy out of the dunghill; that he may set him with princes, even with the princes of his people.” —Psalm 113:1-8 “I will extol thee, my God, O king; and I will bless thy name for ever and ever. Every day will I bless thee; and I will praise thy name for ever and ever. Great is the LORD, and greatly to be praised; and his greatness is unsearchable. One generation shall praise thy works to another, and shall declare thy mighty acts. I will speak of the glorious honor of thy majesty, and of thy wondrous works. And men shall speak of the might of thy terrible acts: and I will declare thy greatness. They shall abundantly utter the memory of thy great goodness, and shall sing of thy righteousness. The LORD is gracious, and full of compassion; slow to anger, and of great mercy. The LORD is good to all: and his tender mercies are over all his works. All thy works shall praise thee, O LORD; and thy saints shall bless thee. They shall speak of the glory of thy kingdom, and talk of thy power; to make known to the sons of men his mighty acts, and the glorious majesty of his kingdom.” —Psalm 145:1-12 God’s name will be praised throughout the ceaseless ages of eternity. Why? Simply because of who He is. And who will be foremost in praising Him? The redeemed humanity—those who have firsthand experience of His power to fully recreate and restore His image in those who were once totally captive to sin (Isaiah 61:1). They will talk—and be a visible manifestation—of His mighty acts and will sing of His righteousness and the “glorious majesty of His kingdom” (Psalm 145:12).\",\"series\":\"The Great Controversy\"},\"19\":{\"title\":\"God’s Health Plan\",\"url\":\"/gospel/health/\",\"category\":\"Gospel\",\"description\":\"Jesus wants to redeem me from sin.

He did not just forgive the sins of the paralytic, but He also healed him from the disease, and He wants the same complete healing for me as well. Does my body belong to me? “What? know ye not that your body is the temple of the Holy Ghost which is in you, which ye have of God, and ye are not your own?

What does God invite me to do with my body? “I beseech you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God, that ye present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God, which is your reasonable service. And be not conformed to this world: but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind, that ye may prove what is that good, and acceptable, and perfect, will of God.” —Romans 12:1-2 God calls on me to present my body as a living and holy sacrifice to Him—my Maker and Redeemer. Then I am to be transformed by the renewing of my mind (note the tight connection between the body and mind). Once more, Jesus does not just want to forgive my sins; He wants to cleanse, heal, and restore His image in me by wholly transforming me! In what things am I to bring God glory? How? “Whether therefore ye eat, or drink, or whatsoever ye do, do all to the glory of God.” —1 Corinthians 10:31 “But my God shall supply all your need according to his riches in glory by Christ Jesus.” —Philippians 3:19 “Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and ye shall find; knock, and it shall be opened unto you: for every one that asketh receiveth; and he that seeketh findeth; and to him that knocketh it shall be opened.” —Matthew 7:7-8 Paul invites me to bring God glory in everything that I do, including the things I eat and drink. This is a high standard that I cannot reach in my own power, but God has made ample provision for this to become a reality in my life by the grace and power of Christ, as long as I do not frustrate His grace with a perverse will. If I ask Jesus to help me live a life that glorifies Him then He will gladly answer that prayer. And because God is love (1 John 4:8), His glory is my good. What does the Bible say about alcohol? “Wine is a mocker, strong drink is raging: and whosoever is deceived thereby is not wise.” —Proverbs 20:1 “Who hath woe? who hath sorrow? who hath contentions? who hath babbling? who hath wounds without cause? who hath redness of eyes? They that tarry long at the wine; they that go to seek mixed wine. Look not thou upon the wine when it is red, when it giveth his colour in the cup, when it moveth itself aright. At the last it biteth like a serpent, and stingeth like an adder.” —Proverbs 23:29-32 “Woe unto them that rise up early in the morning, that they may follow strong drink; that continue until night, till wine inflame them!” —Isaiah 5:11 “For they eat the bread of wickedness, and drink the wine of violence.” —Proverbs 4:17 The Bible is clear and direct in its condemnation of wine and other alcoholic beverages, and science is now agreeing too. Studies have shown that alcohol is toxic to the cells and no amount is actually safe. Wine does contain beneficial flavonoids that help fight free radicals in the body, but so does grape juice! Why should I not consume alcohol? “It is not for kings, O Lemuel, it is not for kings to drink wine; nor for princes strong drink: lest they drink, and forget the law, and pervert the judgment of any of the afflicted.” —Proverbs 31:4-5 “And they sung a new song, saying, Thou art worthy to take the book, and to open the seals thereof: for thou wast slain, and hast redeemed us to God by thy blood out of every kindred, and tongue, and people, and nation; and hast made us unto our God kings and priests: and we shall reign on the earth.” —Revelation 5:9-10 “Wherefore gird up the loins of your mind, be sober, and hope to the end for the grace that is to be brought unto you at the revelation of Jesus Christ.” —1 Peter 1:13 “Finally, my brethren, be strong in the Lord, and in the power of his might. Put on the whole armour of God, that ye may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil. For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places.” —Ephesians 6:10-12 Proverbs plainly says that alcoholic drinks pervert the judgment, and as such, they are not suitable for kings and princes. In Revelation we learn that we are made to be kings and priests to God, which is why Peter calls us to be sober, to bind the mind for action, like a soldier binds his belt in preparation for battle, because our battle is not with flesh and blood; it’s a battle with spiritual forces, and the outcome has eternal consequences. What was the original diet? “And God said, “See, I have given you every herb that yields seed which is on the face of all the earth, and every tree whose fruit yields seed; to you it shall be for food.” —Genesis 1:29, NKJV “Thorns also and thistles shall it bring forth to thee; and thou shalt eat the herb of the field.” —Genesis 3:18 “A righteous man regardeth the life of his beast: but the tender mercies of the wicked are cruel.” —Proverbs 12:10 The original diet in Eden was a whole foods diet composed of plants that yield seeds. Root vegetables were added later after the fall of Adam and Eve. What was the diet after the flood? “Of every clean beast thou shalt take to thee by sevens, the male and his female: and of beasts that are not clean by two, the male and his female.” —Genesis 7:2 “Every moving thing that lives shall be food for you. I have given you all things, even as the green herbs. But you shall not eat flesh with its life, that is, its blood.” —Genesis 9:3-4, NKJV Meat was added to the diet after the flood because when Noah stepped off the ark all the vegetation had been destroyed. But God made a distinction between clean and unclean animals because seven pairs of every clean animal came onto the ark and only two pairs of the unclean, so Noah and his family were allowed to eat every clean animal, as long as the blood was drained. Which animals are clean? “And the LORD spake unto Moses and to Aaron, saying unto them, Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, These are the beasts which ye shall eat among all the beasts that are on the earth. Whatsoever parteth the hoof, and is clovenfooted, and cheweth the cud, among the beasts, that shall ye eat. Nevertheless these shall ye not eat of them that chew the cud, or of them that divide the hoof: as the camel, because he cheweth the cud, but divideth not the hoof; he is unclean unto you. And the coney, because he cheweth the cud, but divideth not the hoof; he is unclean unto you. And the hare, because he cheweth the cud, but divideth not the hoof; he is unclean unto you. And the swine, though he divide the hoof, and be clovenfooted, yet he cheweth not the cud; he is unclean to you. Of their flesh shall ye not eat, and their carcase shall ye not touch; they are unclean to you. ““These shall ye eat of all that are in the waters: whatsoever hath fins and scales in the waters, in the seas, and in the rivers, them shall ye eat. And all that have not fins and scales in the seas, and in the rivers, of all that move in the waters, and of any living thing which is in the waters, they shall be an abomination unto you: they shall be even an abomination unto you; ye shall not eat of their flesh, but ye shall have their carcases in abomination. Whatsoever hath no fins nor scales in the waters, that shall be an abomination unto you.” —Leviticus 11:1-12 The unclean animals are scavengers and bottom feeders; some examples include cats, dogs, horses, camels, eagles, vultures, hogs, squirrels, rabbits, catfish, eels, lobsters, clams, crabs, shrimp, oysters, and frogs. These laws are not just for the Jewish nation because Noah was not Jewish, and they were not done away with at the cross because our physiology did not change at the cross. If these were unfit for human consumption before the cross then they are still unfit today. Why does God restrict unclean animals? “For the LORD God is a sun and shield: the LORD will give grace and glory: no good thing will he withhold from them that walk uprightly.” —Psalm 84:11 “And said, If thou wilt diligently hearken to the voice of the LORD thy God, and wilt do that which is right in his sight, and wilt give ear to his commandments, and keep all his statutes, I will put none of these diseases upon thee, which I have brought upon the Egyptians: for I am the LORD that healeth thee.” —Exodus 15:26 “If ye know these things, happy are ye if ye do them.” —John 13:17 “Thou wilt shew me the path of life: in thy presence is fulness of joy; at thy right hand there are pleasures for evermore.” —Psalm 16:11 We are not to consume unclean animals because they are detrimental to our health. God’s mission is to bring healing into our bodies and minds, so He never withholds anything that is good for us. He is also far better at pleasure and happiness than Satan because His way does not lead to a crash after the high, or desensitization that requires increasingly higher doses, or addiction. It may seem difficult, overwhelming, or even impossible to make these dietary changes, but when I don’t have the willpower myself, I can give Him my will, and He will give me the power. What about Peter’s vision in Acts 10? “On the morrow, as they went on their journey, and drew nigh unto the city, Peter went up upon the housetop to pray about the sixth hour: and he became very hungry, and would have eaten: but while they made ready, he fell into a trance, and saw heaven opened, and a certain vessel descending unto him, as it had been a great sheet knit at the four corners, and let down to the earth: wherein were all manner of fourfooted beasts of the earth, and wild beasts, and creeping things, and fowls of the air. And there came a voice to him, Rise, Peter; kill, and eat. But Peter said, Not so, Lord; for I have never eaten any thing that is common or unclean. And the voice spake unto him again the second time, What God hath cleansed, that call not thou common. This was done thrice: and the vessel was received up again into heaven.” —Acts 10:9-16 “And he said unto them, Ye know how that it is an unlawful thing for a man that is a Jew to keep company, or come unto one of another nation; but God hath shewed me that I should not call any man common or unclean.” —Acts 10:28 The subject of Peter’s vision was people, not animals. God was telling him that he should not view Gentiles as unclean because he was about to have Gentile visitors, whom he would have refused to see, as Jewish law forbade associating with Gentiles (Acts 10:28), but after receiving this vision, Peter welcomed them. What does Isaiah say about ignoring dietary laws? “I am sought of them that asked not for me; I am found of them that sought me not: I said, Behold me, behold me, unto a nation that was not called by my name. I have spread out my hands all the day unto a rebellious people, which walketh in a way that was not good, after their own thoughts; a people that provoketh me to anger continually to my face; that sacrificeth in gardens, and burneth incense upon altars of brick; which remain among the graves, and lodge in the monuments, which eat swine’s flesh, and broth of abominable things is in their vessels; which say, Stand by thyself, come not near to me; for I am holier than thou. These are a smoke in my nose, a fire that burneth all the day.” —Isaiah 65:1-5 “For, behold, the LORD will come with fire, and with his chariots like a whirlwind, to render his anger with fury, and his rebuke with flames of fire. For by fire and by his sword will the LORD plead with all flesh: and the slain of the LORD shall be many. They that sanctify themselves, and purify themselves in the gardens behind one tree in the midst, eating swine’s flesh, and the abomination, and the mouse, shall be consumed together, saith the LORD.” —Isaiah 66:15-17 “Say unto them, As I live, saith the Lord GOD, I have no pleasure in the death of the wicked; but that the wicked turn from his way and live: turn ye, turn ye from your evil ways; for why will ye die, O house of Israel?” —Ezekiel 33:11 God cannot save those who knowingly go down the path of destruction, nor does He enjoy destroying them, but eventually there will come a point when He can do nothing else but leave them to the consequences of their own destructive choices. What promise does the Bible give? “For we have not a high priest which cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities; but was in all points tempted like as we are, yet without sin. Let us therefore come boldly unto the throne of grace, that we may obtain mercy, and find grace to help in time of need.” —Hebrews 4:15-16 Jesus knows my struggles because He experienced them Himself, and so He bids me to come to His throne that I may receive mercy and grace to meet them with boldness and overcome.\",\"series\":\"Made Whole by Christ\"},\"20\":{\"title\":\"God’s Law of Love\",\"url\":\"/gospel/law/\",\"category\":\"Gospel\",\"description\":\"The book of James calls it the royal law of liberty. Can it even be kept? Or is obedience legalism?\",\"body\":\"How does the Bible describe the law of God? “The works of his hands are verity and judgment; all his commandments are sure. They stand fast for ever and ever, and are done in truth and uprightness.” —Psalm 111:7-8 “The law of the LORD is perfect, converting the soul: the testimony of the LORD is sure, making wise the simple. The statutes of the LORD are right, rejoicing the heart: the commandment of the LORD is pure, enlightening the eyes.” —Psalm 19:7-8 Every government has laws to ensure order and protection for its citizens. It is no different with the King of the universe and His government, except His law is eternal, true, upright, perfect, sure, right, and pure. God’s dominion knows no bounds, and His law, therefore, is universal as well, so even though it’s mostly neglected on earth, it is still binding. Does it have a role to play in my life? “The fear of the LORD is clean, enduring for ever: the judgments of the LORD are true and righteous altogether. More to be desired are they than gold, yea, than much fine gold: sweeter also than honey and the honeycomb. Moreover by them is thy servant warned: and in keeping of them there is great reward.” —Psalm 19:9-11 “And the LORD commanded us to do all these statutes, to fear the LORD our God, for our good always, that he might preserve us alive, as it is at this day.” —Deuteronomy 6:24 “My son, forget not my law; but let thine heart keep my commandments: for length of days, and long life, and peace, shall they add to thee.” —Proverbs 3:1-2 “Let us hear the conclusion of the whole matter: fear God, and keep his commandments: for this is the whole duty of man.” —Ecclesiastes 12:13 Satan rebelled against God’s law in heaven because he didn’t want to be restricted by it, and when Adam and Even believed his lie about defining good and evil for themselves (Genesis 3:5), his lawless kingdom took over earth as well. Our Creator God defines good and evil for us in His law because He knows what’s best for us better than we will ever know ourselves. And His law is not a restriction; it’s there to be a blessing, to protect us from evils, such as murder, adultery, theft, and falsehood, ensuring a happy and harmonious existence for all. How else does the law affect me? “If ye fulfil the royal law according to the scripture, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself, ye do well: But if ye have respect to persons, ye commit sin, and are convinced of the law as transgressors. For whosoever shall keep the whole law, and yet offend in one point, he is guilty of all. For he that said, Do not commit adultery, said also, Do not kill. Now if thou commit no adultery, yet if thou kill, thou art become a transgressor of the law. So speak ye, and so do, as they that shall be judged by the law of liberty.” —James 2:8-12 “For as many as are of the works of the law are under the curse: for it is written, Cursed is every one that continueth not in all things which are written in the book of the law to do them.” —Galatians 3:10 “But we are all as an unclean thing, and all our righteousnesses are as filthy rags; and we all do fade as a leaf; and our iniquities, like the wind, have taken us away.” —Isaiah 64:6 When James is talking about the law, he is referring to the Ten Commandments, and he actually says it’s not enough to keep some or even most of them. Breaking even one is breaking them all. Consequently, there is no human being who hasn’t been condemned by the law, which is the standard during the judgment. Does God leave me in my condemned state? “But that no man is justified by the law in the sight of God, it is evident: for, The just shall live by faith.” —Galatians 3:11 “For sin shall not have dominion over you: for ye are not under the law, but under grace.” —Romans 6:14 “Being justified freely by his grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus: whom God hath set forth to be a propitiation through faith in his blood, to declare his righteousness for the remission of sins that are past, through the forbearance of God; to declare, I say, at this time his righteousness: that he might be just, and the justifier of him which believeth in Jesus. Where is boasting then? It is excluded. By what law? of works? Nay: but by the law of faith. Therefore we conclude that a man is justified by faith without the deeds of the law.” —Romans 3:24-28 Because Jesus is the Creator God, He was able to take the condemnation of the law on Himself at the cross, on behalf of all humanity, so that every person who accepts Him by faith in His substitutionary sacrifice could stand before the law clothed in His perfectly righteous life! Does that mean we are now free to break it? “Therefore we conclude that a man is justified by faith without the deeds of the law. Is he the God of the Jews only? Is he not also of the Gentiles? Yes, of the Gentiles also: seeing it is one God, which shall justify the circumcision by faith, and uncircumcision through faith. Do we then make void the law through faith? God forbid: yea, we establish the law.” —Romans 3:28-31 “What then? shall we sin, because we are not under the law, but under grace? God forbid.” —Romans 6:15 “Think not that I am come to destroy the law, or the prophets: I am not come to destroy, but to fulfil. For verily I say unto you, Till heaven and earth pass, one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law, till all be fulfilled.” —Matthew 5:17-18 If you were caught speeding and the police officer wanted to give you a hefty fine, but decided to give you a warning instead, would you then go screeching out back on the highway to break the speed limit again? No, you would carefully watch your speed. Jesus’ death on the cross was an act of mercy and forgiveness for those who accept it, not a license to live lawlessly. What is the breaking of God’s law called? “Whosoever committeth sin transgresseth also the law: for sin is the transgression of the law.” —1 John 3:4 “Therefore by the deeds of the law there shall no flesh be justified in his sight: for by the law is the knowledge of sin.” —Romans 3:20 What does sin do? “Behold, the LORD’S hand is not shortened, that it cannot save; neither his ear heavy, that it cannot hear: But your iniquities have separated between you and your God, and your sins have hid his face from you, that he will not hear.” —Isaiah 59:1-2 “For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.” —Romans 6:23 Sin cannot exist in the presence of a holy God because at the root of sin is selfishness, which is abhorent to God’s character of love. As a result, sin creates separation between me and God, the Giver of life, and leads to eternal death if left untreated. What is the motivation for keeping His law? “If ye love me, keep my commandments.” —John 14:15 “For this is the love of God, that we keep his commandments: and his commandments are not grievous.” —1 John 5:3 “Then one of them, which was a lawyer, asked him a question, tempting him, and saying, Master, which is the great commandment in the law? Jesus said unto him, Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind. This is the first and great commandment. And the second is like unto it, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself. On these two commandments hang all the law and the prophets.” —Matthew 22:35-40 “Love worketh no ill to his neighbour: therefore love is the fulfilling of the law.” —Romans 13:10 Since selfishness is at the root of sin, and sin is the breaking of His law, then the law is really a law of love, dealing with my relationship with God (the first four commandments) and my neighbor (the last six). That’s why Jesus said that the entire law hangs on loving God and loving my neighbor. When there is genuine love present in a relationship then pleasing that person ceases to become a burden; in fact, without love for Jesus it’s not possible to keep His law. Can the law be fulfilled in my life? “For what the law could not do, in that it was weak through the flesh, God sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh, and for sin, condemned sin in the flesh: that the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit.” —Romans 8:3-4 If my heart is motivated by love for Jesus and filled with the Holy Spirit, then the law can be fulfilled in my life in Christ by faith. When I ask Him in faith, believing that He can and will accomplish it, He makes it a reality. Apart from His abiding presence in me (John 15:14-15), the law will never be fulfilled in my life, no matter how hard I try. Christ works in me when I surrender fully to Him—when I choose daily to die to self and pray, “Not my will, but Yours be done” (Matthew 26:39). What is one of the purposes of the law? “He who says, “I know Him,” and does not keep His commandments, is a liar, and the truth is not in him. But whoever keeps His word, truly the love of God is perfected in him. By this we know that we are in Him.” —1 John 2:4-5, NKJV “Not every one that saith unto me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of heaven; but he that doeth the will of my Father which is in heaven. Many will say to me in that day, Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied in thy name? and in thy name have cast out devils? and in thy name done many wonderful works? And then will I profess unto them, I never knew you: depart from me, ye that work iniquity.” —Matthew 7:21-23 “The heart is deceitful above all things, and desperately wicked: who can know it? I the LORD search the heart, I try the reins, even to give every man according to his ways, and according to the fruit of his doings.” —Jeremiah 17:9-10 “O LORD, thou hast searched me, and known me. Thou knowest my downsitting and mine uprising, thou understandest my thought afar off. Thou compassest my path and my lying down, and art acquainted with all my ways. For there is not a word in my tongue, but, lo, O LORD, thou knowest it altogether.” —Psalm 139:1-4 God knows me better than I know myself, and He knows if I truly love Him. The Ten Commandments are really a mirror that shows my genuine condition; they provide evidence letting me know if I truly love Him because it can be easy to deceive myself. Jesus says there will be people who served Him and thought they loved Him, but their lawlessness will say otherwise. What promise does God give me? “For this is the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel after those days, saith the Lord; I will put my laws into their mind, and write them in their hearts: and I will be to them a God, and they shall be to me a people.” —Hebrews 8:10 “Then will I sprinkle clean water upon you, and ye shall be clean: from all your filthiness, and from all your idols, will I cleanse you. A new heart also will I give you, and a new spirit will I put within you: and I will take away the stony heart out of your flesh, and I will give you an heart of flesh. And I will put my spirit within you, and cause you to walk in my statutes, and ye shall keep my judgments, and do them.” —Ezekiel 36:25-27 “Hitherto have ye asked nothing in my name: ask, and ye shall receive, that your joy may be full.” —John 16:34 “I delight to do thy will, O my God: yea, thy law is within my heart.” —Psalm 40:8 God promises to help me keep His commandments because He knows that I cannot overcome sin myself. But He does not force Himself on anyone, so I must ask, and the promise is He will write His law in my heart and mind, enabling me to walk in His commandments through the power of the Holy Spirit dwelling in me! The only one who can create a new heart in me is the One who created the world in Eden. If I take Him at His word, believing that He will keep this promise, He will do it according to my faith (Matthew 9:29), making it a delight for me to do His will (Psalm 40:8)! What are the Ten Commandments? “[First:] I am the LORD thy God, which have brought thee out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage. Thou shalt have no other gods before me.” —Exodus 20:2-3 “[Second:] Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image, or any likeness of any thing that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath, or that is in the water under the earth: Thou shalt not bow down thyself to them, nor serve them: for I the LORD thy God am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth generation of them that hate me; and shewing mercy unto thousands of them that love me, and keep my commandments.” —Exodus 20:4-6 “[Third:] Thou shalt not take the name of the LORD thy God in vain; for the LORD will not hold him guiltless that taketh his name in vain.” —Exodus 20:7 “[Fourth:] Remember the sabbath day, to keep it holy. Six days shalt thou labour, and do all thy work: but the seventh day is the sabbath of the LORD thy God: in it thou shalt not do any work, thou, nor thy son, nor thy daughter, thy manservant, nor thy maidservant, nor thy cattle, nor thy stranger that is within thy gates: For in six days the LORD made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that in them is, and rested the seventh day: wherefore the LORD blessed the sabbath day, and hallowed it.” —Exodus 20:8-11 “[Fifth:] Honour thy father and thy mother: that thy days may be long upon the land which the LORD thy God giveth thee.” —Exodus 20:12 “[Sixth:] Thou shalt not kill.” —Exodus 20:13 “[Seventh:] Thou shalt not commit adultery.” —Exodus 20:14 “[Eight:] Thou shalt not steal.” —Exodus 20:15 “[Ninth:] Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbour.” —Exodus 20:16 “[Tenth:] Thou shalt not covet thy neighbour’s house, thou shalt not covet thy neighbour’s wife, nor his manservant, nor his maidservant, nor his ox, nor his ass, nor any thing that is thy neighbour’s.” —Exodus 20:17 Did they change in the New Testament? “[First:] Then saith Jesus unto him, Get thee hence, Satan: for it is written, Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and him only shalt thou serve.” —Matthew 4:10 “[Second:] Little children, keep yourselves from idols.” —1 John 5:21 “[Third:] Let as many servants as are under the yoke count their own masters worthy of all honour, that the name of God and his doctrine be not blasphemed.” —1 Timothy 6:1 “[Fourth:] For he spake in a certain place of the seventh day on this wise, And God did rest the seventh day from all his works. … There remaineth therefore a rest to the people of God. For he that is entered into his rest, he also hath ceased from his own works, as God did from his.” —Hebrews 4:4, 9-10 “[Fifth:] Honour thy father and thy mother.” —Matthew 19:19 “[Sixth:] Thou shalt not kill.” —Romans 13:9 “[Seventh:] Thou shalt not commit adultery.” —Romans 13:9 “[Eight:] Thou shalt not steal.” —Romans 13:9 “[Ninth:] Thou shalt not bear false witness.” —Romans 13:9 “[Tenth:] Thou shalt not covet.” —Romans 7:7 Is it possible for the law to change? “Jesus Christ the same yesterday, and to day, and for ever.” —Hebrews 13:8 “And it is easier for heaven and earth to pass, than one tittle of the law to fail.” —Luke 16:17 “My covenant will I not break, nor alter the thing that is gone out of my lips.” —Psalm 89:34 The fact that Jesus had to die on the cross to pay for the penalty of lawlessness for us is the biggest evidence that the law of God is unchangeable. What is God’s law a reflection of? “[God is good:] And Jesus said unto him, Why callest thou me good? none is good, save one, that is, God.” —Luke 18:19 “[Law is good:] But we know that the law is good, if a man use it lawfully.” —1 Timothy 1:8 “[God is holy:] But the LORD of hosts shall be exalted in judgment, and God that is holy shall be sanctified in righteousness.” —Isaiah 5:16 “[Law is holy:] Wherefore the law is holy, and the commandment holy, and just, and good.” —Romans 7:12 “[God is perfect:] Be ye therefore perfect, even as your Father which is in heaven is perfect.” —Matthew 5:48 “[Law is perfect:] The law of the LORD is perfect, converting the soul: the testimony of the LORD is sure, making wise the simple.” —Psalms 19:7 “[God is pure:] And every man that hath this hope in him purifieth himself, even as he [Christ] is pure.” —1 John 3:3 “[Law is pure:] The commandment of the LORD is pure, enlightening the eyes.” —Psalms 19:8 “[God is just:] He is the Rock, his work is perfect: for all his ways are judgment: a God of truth and without iniquity, just and right is he.” —Deuteronomy 32:4 “[Law is just:] Wherefore the law is holy, and the commandment holy, and just, and good.” —Romans 7:12 “[God is true:] He that hath received his testimony hath set to his seal that God is true.” —John 3:33 “[Law is true:] The judgments of the LORD are true and righteous altogether.” —Psalms 19:9 “[God is spiritual:] For they drank of that spiritual Rock that followed them: and that Rock was Christ.” —1 Corinthians 10:4 “[Law is spiritual:] For we know that the law is spiritual: but I am carnal, sold under sin.” —Romans 7:14 “[God is righteousness:] In his days Judah shall be saved, and Israel shall dwell safely: and this is his name whereby he shall be called, THE LORD OUR RIGHTEOUSNESS.” —Jeremiah 23:6 “[Law is righteousness:] My tongue shall speak of thy word: for all thy commandments are righteousness.” —Psalms 119:172 “[God is faithful:] God is faithful, by whom ye were called unto the fellowship of his Son Jesus Christ our Lord.” —1 Corinthians 1:9 “[Law is faithful:] All thy commandments are faithful.” —Psalms 119:86 “[God is love:] He that loveth not knoweth not God; for God is love.” —1 John 4:8 “[Law is love:] Love worketh no ill to his neighbour: therefore love is the fulfilling of the law.” —Romans 13:10 “[God is unchangeable:] Every good gift and every perfect gift is from above, and cometh down from the Father of lights, with whom is no variableness, neither shadow of turning.” —James 1:17 “[Law is unchangeable:] For verily I say unto you, Till heaven and earth pass, one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law, till all be fulfilled.” —Matthew 5:18 “[God is everlasting:] And Abraham planted a grove in Beersheba, and called there on the name of the LORD, the everlasting God.” —Genesis 21:33 “[Law is everlasting:] The works of his hands are verity and judgment; all his commandments are sure. They stand fast for ever and ever, and are done in truth and uprightness.” —Psalms 111:7-8 The Ten Commandments are a reflection of God’s character in written form, and Jesus demonstrated what it looks like in human form. Through the law and Jesus’ life we may better comprehend God’s character. Because God cannot change, neither can His law. How does the devil feel about keeping God’s law? “And the dragon was wroth with the woman, and went to make war with the remnant of her seed, which keep the commandments of God, and have the testimony of Jesus Christ.” —Revelation 12:17 “Jesus replied, “And why do you break the command of God for the sake of your tradition? … Thus you nullify the word of God for the sake of your tradition. You hypocrites! Isaiah prophesied correctly about you: ‘These people honor Me with their lips, but their hearts are far from Me. They worship Me in vain; they teach as doctrine the precepts of men.’” —Matthew 15:3, 6-9 “It is time for thee, LORD, to work: for they have made void thy law.” —Psalm 119:126 The devil’s war against God and His law started in the courts of heaven and has been raging ever since here on Earth. Is it any surprise that the devil would try to persuade people that God’s law is no longer binding and even go as far as persecuting those who keep it? What does Revelation say about the saints? “Here is the patience of the saints: here are they that keep the commandments of God, and the faith of Jesus.” —Revelation 14:12 “Blessed are they that do his commandments, that they may have right to the tree of life, and may enter in through the gates into the city.” —Revelation 22:14 Those who are saved will be keeping the commandments of God, not because they are saved by doing so, but because of their love for Jesus.\"},\"21\":{\"title\":\"How Can I Be Saved?\",\"url\":\"/gospel/salvation/\",\"category\":\"Gospel\",\"description\":\"Because all have sinned, all are sitting on death row, whether we realize it or not.

In this was manifested the love of God toward us, because that God sent his only begotten Son into the world, that we might live through him.” —1 John 4:8-9 What did God desire for Adam and Eve? “So God created man in his own image, in the image of God created he him; male and female created he them. And God blessed them, and God said unto them, Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it: and have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth. And God said, Behold, I have given you every herb bearing seed, which is upon the face of all the earth, and every tree, in the which is the fruit of a tree yielding seed; to you it shall be for meat. And to every beast of the earth, and to every fowl of the air, and to every thing that creepeth upon the earth, wherein there is life, I have given every green herb for meat: and it was so. And God saw every thing that he had made, and, behold, it was very good. And the evening and the morning were the sixth day.” —Genesis 1:27-31 God did all He could to give Adam and Eve the very best start. Everything He made was very good and designed to bless and make their life in the garden a joyful and invigorating experience. What changed once they sinned? “And they heard the voice of the LORD God walking in the garden in the cool of the day: and Adam and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the LORD God amongst the trees of the garden.” —Genesis 3:8 Sin introduced feelings of shame and guilt into Adam and Eve’s life, which created a separation between them and God and caused them to hide from Him presence, the Giver of life. What does sin lead to? “For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.” —Romans 6:23 “Whosoever committeth sin transgresseth also the law: for sin is the transgression of the law.” —1 John 3:4 Sin started the process of decay and death on the earth that would affect not just Adam and Eve, but every other living thing on it. Death was now a part of life becase they were separated from the Giver of life. Furthermore, the Bible defines sin as the transgression of God’s law, and the penalty for breaking it is death. How many have sinned? “For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God.” —Romans 3:23 All have succumbed to sin because once Adam and Eve sinned, it weakend their human nature and made it harder for them, and every succeeding generation, to resist it. Is there a solution to our predicament? “Therefore as by the offence of one, judgment came upon all men to condemnation; even so by the righteousness of one the free gift came upon all men unto justification of life. For as by one man’s disobedience many were made sinners, so by the obedience of one many shall be made righteous.” —Romans 5:18-19 God did not leave us in our sin, but promised us a path back to life and reconciliation with Him by offering His Son, Jesus Christ, as a substitute for us so we could be justified and made righteous by His perfect life. Are there multiple solutions to the sin problem? “Neither is there salvation in any other: for there is none other name under heaven given among men, whereby we must be saved.” —Acts 4:12 “Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.” —John 14:6 There is only one road that leads to salvation from sin, and that road is Jesus. Any other way—and there are many—cannot save us. Many have wondered how Jesus can make such an exclusive claim, considering the number of religions in the world, but it’s simple: Jesus is the only one who humbled Himself, came down from the glory of heaven, took on human nature, lived among His creation, and then died for their sins! No other religion has a god like that. How did Jesus redeem us from the condemnation of the law? “Christ hath redeemed us from the curse of the law, being made a curse for us: for it is written, Cursed is every one that hangeth on a tree.” —Galatians 3:13 “For he hath made him to be sin for us, who knew no sin; that we might be made the righteousness of God in him.” —2 Corinthians 5:21 Christ took our sins upon Himself and suffered their penalty on our behalf. What did this curse involve? “Thou hast put all things in subjection under his feet. For in that he put all in subjection under him, he left nothing that is not put under him. But now we see not yet all things put under him. But we see Jesus, who was made a little lower than the angels for the suffering of death, crowned with glory and honour; that he by the grace of God should taste death for every man.” —Hebrews 2:8-9 The penalty for sin is death, and Christ’s death on the cross paid that penalty for every single person. How can I receive forgiveness of my sins? “Repent ye therefore, and be converted, that your sins may be blotted out, when the times of refreshing shall come from the presence of the Lord.” —Acts 3:19 “Let the wicked forsake his way, and the unrighteous man his thoughts: and let him return unto the LORD, and he will have mercy upon him; and to our God, for he will abundantly pardon.” —Isaiah 55:7 Forsaking my way implies turning around and going in the opposite direction—from running away from God toward sin to running away from sin toward God. If I repent and have a desire to leave sin behind, the promise is I will receive forgiveness. Is any sin too great for God? “If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.” —1 John 1:9 How exactly am I saved? “For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God. Not of works, lest any man should boast.” —Ephesians 2:8-9 “Therefore we conclude that a man is justified by faith without the deeds of the law.” —Romans 3:28 “Therefore being justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ: by whom also we have access by faith into this grace wherein we stand, and rejoice in hope of the glory of God.” —Romans 5:1-2 “But that no man is justified by the law in the sight of God, it is evident: for, The just shall live by faith.” —Galatians 3:11 There is nothing I can do to earn salvation; it is a free gift that I receive by grace through faith in His love, His forgiveness, and His victory on the cross. The Protestant Reformation brought this marvelous truth to light after centuries of a counterfeit method of salvation focused on works. Sadly, however, Protestantism has begun to drift away from its original position. In 1999, the Catholic and Lutheran churches issued a Joint Declaration on the Doctrine of Justification, which includes this key statement: “By grace alone, in faith in Christ’s saving work and not because of any merit on our part, we are accepted by God …” Note that “by grace alone” is not the same as “by faith alone.” While it is true that we are saved by grace, that grace is appropriated by faith—without faith, there can be no grace. The joint statement elevates grace over faith, while the Bible emphasizes faith. This difference may not seem significant at first, but it becomes critical when viewed through the lens of Catholic teaching, which holds that the Church is the dispenser of grace from the treasury of merit, which includes not only Christ’s good works but also those of Mary and the saints. Am I saved by Christ’s saving work? “And almost all things are by the law purged with blood; and without shedding of blood is no remission.” —Hebrews 9:22 “In whom we have redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of sins, according to the riches of his grace.” —Ephesians 1:7 “Whom God hath set forth to be a propitiation through faith in his blood, to declare his righteousness for the remission of sins that are past, through the forbearance of God.” —Romans 3:25 The Bible is clear that it is not Christ’s works that save me, but His shed blood. In the Joint Declaration, the phrase “faith in Christ’s saving work” refers to the treasury of merit, which the Church dispenses to atone for sin; however, the Bible teaches that without the shedding of blood there is no remission of sin. The truth is Christ died for each person individually (Galatians 2:20). His death paid the penalty for my sins—the penalty that I was supposed to pay—while His righteous life satisfies the claims of the law upon me, namely, perfect righteousness, which my life could never meet (Romans 5:9-10). What happens once I accept God’s free gift? “There is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit.” —Romans 8:1 Once I turn away from my sins and accept Jesus as my Lord and Saviour, I’m no longer condemned because I’m covered by His perfect life and forgiven. What privilege do those who have received Christ have? “But as many as received him, to them gave he power to become the sons of God, even to them that believe on his name.” —John 1:12 Christ’s death on the cross restored the rift that occured between God and the human race when Adam and Eve sinned, and we can now once again be called sons and daughters of God! Can I know I have eternal life? “And this is the record, that God hath given to us eternal life, and this life is in his Son. He that hath the Son hath life; and he that hath not the Son of God hath not life. These things have I written unto you that believe on the name of the Son of God; that ye may know that ye have eternal life, and that ye may believe on the name of the Son of God.” —1 John 5:11-13 What role does choice play in salvation? “And if it seem evil unto you to serve the LORD, choose you this day whom ye will serve; whether the gods which your fathers served that were on the other side of the flood, or the gods of the Amorites, in whose land ye dwell: but as for me and my house, we will serve the LORD.” —Joshua 24:15 “I call heaven and earth to record this day against you, that I have set before you life and death, blessing and cursing: therefore choose life, that both thou and thy seed may live.” —Deuteronomy 30:19 “Behold, I stand at the door, and knock: if any man hear my voice, and open the door, I will come in to him, and will sup with him, and he with me.” —Revelation 3:20 God’s way of salvation has always been about respecting freedom of choice. He gave Satan the option to rebel, and He did not immediately destroy him when he did. God permitted Adam and Eve to rebel too. Likewise, I am free to choose whether I want to serve Him or not. Jesus wants to save every person (1 Timothy 2:3-4)—He wants me to choose Him—but He will not force Himself on anyone. In fact, this is a daily choice; I can choose, anytime, to leave Christ and go in another direction, which is why it’s imperative to reaffirm my decision and recommit myself to Him on a daily basis (Luke 9:23). Every single day is a gift from my Creator, and it’s my privilege to give it back to Him. What does it mean to accept Jesus as Savior and Lord? “But grow in grace, and in the knowledge of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ. To him be glory both now and for ever. Amen.” —2 Peter 3:18 Both are a fundamental aspect of salvation, but there is a difference between the two. Accepting Jesus as Savior means being saved from the penalty of sin (death) because He offers forgiveness for every sin that I’ve genuinely confessed and decided to forsake. Once forgiven, He credits me with His own righteousness so that my imperfect life is covered by His perfect life. Accepting Jesus as Lord, on the other hand, means surrendering my will to Him, thereby making Him the ruler of my life. This is a decision that takes place daily (Luke 9:23) because our natural desire is to do and live as we please, but the Bible calls this way of life sin (Isaiah 53:6) because our human nature, by default, is contrary to the law of God (Romans 8:7). The truth is God knows what is best for us better than we know ourselves, and He wants us to trust Him enough to allow Him to rule our lives, which, in turn, gives Him permission to mold us into Him image (Ephesians 4:13). This surrender is crucial, because without it He does not have the right to transform our characters to reflect the beauty of His character. What is God’s desire for me? “For this is good and acceptable in the sight of God our Savior, who desires all men to be saved and to come to the knowledge of the truth.” —1 Timothy 2:3-4, NKJV “For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.” —John 3:16\",\"series\":\"Experiencing Salvation\"},\"22\":{\"title\":\"The Gospel in the Sanctuary\",\"url\":\"/gospel/sanctuary/\",\"category\":\"Gospel\",\"description\":\"First introduced to Moses on Mount Sinai, the sanctuary offers deep insights into God’s plan of salvation.\",\"body\":\"Why did God tell Moses to build a sanctuary? “And let them make me a sanctuary; that I may dwell among them.” —Exodus 25:8 The sanctuary was built so that God could dwell among His people. When Adam and Eve sinned, they lost the closeness they had with their Creator because sin separates us from Him (Isaiah 59:1-2). Our Creator God is holy, and He cannot dwell in the presence of sin because His holiness is a consuming fire to sin and anyone who cherishes it (Deuteronomy 4:24). In order to remove this barrier created by sin, God told Moses to build a sanctuary so He could again live with His people. His permanent presence in the sanctuary would be a source of comfort to the Israelites as He guided, protected, and provided for them in their journey through life. What did the sanctuary reveal? “Thy way, O God, is in the sanctuary: who is so great a God as our God?” —Psalm 77:13 The sanctuary reveals God’s way of dealing with sin and its consequences; it’s His marvelous plan of salvation, the good news, outlined in detail through a variety of symbols and ceremonies. What was the central concept taught by the sanctuary? “And almost all things are by the law purged with blood; and without shedding of blood is no remission.” —Hebrews 9:22 “For the life of the flesh is in the blood: and I have given it to you upon the altar to make an atonement for your souls: for it is the blood that maketh an atonement for the soul.” —Leviticus 17:11 The sanctuary service revolved around the sacrifice of animals, and this taught that blood, a symbol of life, had to be shed to obtain forgiveness of sin. But it wasn’t the blood of the sacrificed animals that provided forgiveness: theirs was merely a symbol that pointed to the only blood that could—the blood, and life, of the One who was sinned against. Jesus, the Creator of heaven and earth, is the Lamb of God slain from the foundation of the world (Revelation 13:8) who takes away my sins (John 1:29). The sanctuary thus provides a vivid portrayal of the high price of sin. It may seem insignificant to us, but sin ended up costing the very life Jesus, and if it wasn’t for His death on our behalf, it would’ve cost us our lives. Satan makes it look attractive, perhaps even life-giving at times, but the truth is sin always takes life away, while bringing pain, suffering, and, ultimately, death (Romans 6:23). Where did Moses get the sanctuary blueprint? “According to all that I shew thee, after the pattern of the tabernacle, and the pattern of all the instruments thereof, even so shall ye make it.” —Exodus 25:9 The blueprint for the sanctuary came from God Himself because, through it, He wanted to teach important lessons about the plan of salvation. Originally it was a portable, tent-like structure made of acacia wood, goat hair, animal skins, silver, and gold, consisting of three areas: the courtyard, the Holy Place, and the Most Holy Place. The courtyard, the area around the sanctuary, was 75 feet by 150 feet (Exodus 27:18) and fenced with linen cloth attached to 60 evenly spaced pillars of brass (Exodus 27:9-16). This perimiter had only one opening through which the sinner would enter the courtyard. Upon entry, the sinner would walk toward the altar of burnt offering (Exodus 40:6), where his or her animal sacrifice would be consumed by fire. Past the altar, but before the sanctuary entrance, was a laver (basin) for the priests to wash their hands and feet. The sanctuary itself was made up of two rooms, the Holy Place and the Most Holy Place, and the two were separated by a thick veil (curtain). The sanctuary walls were made of wooden boards overlaid in gold and set in silver sockets (Exodus 26:15-19, 29), while the roof consisted of four coverings: linen, goat hair, ram skin, and badger skin (Exodus 26:1, 7-14). Upon entry into the sanctuary, the first room was the Holy Place, containing a seven-branched candlestick that was kept burning at all times (Exodus 25:31-40), an altar of incense that was also kept consistently burning (Exodus 30:7-8), and a table of showbread with loaves of bread on it (Exodus 25:30; Leviticus 24:5-9). Past the thick veil was the Most Holy Place, the room where the presence of God resided. It contained the Ark of the Covenant (Exodus 40:3), which had the mercy seat on top of it and two angels, made of pure gold, on top of the mercy seat (Exodus 25:17-22). Inside the ark were the Ten Commandments written with the finger of God (Deuteronomy 10:4-5). Of what was the sanctuary a copy? “Now this is the main point of the things we are saying: We have such a High Priest, who is seated at the right hand of the throne of the Majesty in the heavens, a Minister of the sanctuary and of the true tabernacle which the Lord erected, and not man. For every high priest is appointed to offer both gifts and sacrifices. Therefore it is necessary that this One also have something to offer. For if He were on earth, He would not be a priest, since there are priests who offer the gifts according to the law; who serve the copy and shadow of the heavenly things, as Moses was divinely instructed when he was about to make the tabernacle. For He said, “See that you make all things according to the pattern shown you on the mountain.”” —Hebrews 8:1-5 The Hebrew sanctuary was a copy, a “shadow,” of the sanctuary in heaven of which Jesus is the High Priest, offering forgiveness of sins to the repenting sinner. In other words, God’s true sanctuary is the heavenly one, not the earthly one. How did a sinner receive forgiveness of sins? “And he shall lay his hand upon the head of the sin offering, and slay it for a sin offering in the place where they kill the burnt offering.” —Leviticus 4:33 A sinner would walk into the courtyard with a sacrificial lamb and approach the altar of burnt offering. Then he would confess his sins onto the lamb by placing his hand on its head (Leviticus 4:29; 5:5), symbolically transferring his sins to the lamb. Because the lamb was now symbolically guilty, it had to pay the penalty of sin—death, and the sinner would then slay the lamb with his own hand. Obviously, this was not an easy process, but it was intended to show the seriousness of sin. Afterward, the priest either ate part of the animal sacrifice (Leviticus 6:26) or sprinkled some of its blood inside the sanctuary (Leviticus 4:16-17), depending on the sacrifice offered. This meant the sin was then transferred from the lamb to the priest and then into the sanctuary, and the sinner walked away free from the penalty of sin. How do I receive forgiveness of sins? “The next day John seeth Jesus coming unto him, and saith, Behold the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the world.” —John 1:29 The animal sacrifices pointed to the Lamb of God sacrificed in the “courtyard” of this earth on the “altar” of a hill called Calvary. While the Hebrews were forgiven by looking forward, in faith, to the future sacrifice of Jesus, I am forgiven by looking backward, in faith, to what is now a completed sacrifice on the cross on my behalf. When Jesus died, the veil separating the Holy Place from the Most Holy Place in the earthly sanctuary was torn from top to bottom (Matthew 27:51), a divine indication that its services were obsolete from that moment on because the One true and great sacrifice they were all pointing to had been accomplished (Daniel 9:27). Any talk of building a new temple in Jerusalem to reinstitute those services is a denial of Jesus’ sacrificial death on behalf of and for all. What did the sanctuary furniture represent? Every piece of furniture points to Jesus and represents an aspect of His work on my behalf to save me from sin: - The altar of burnt offering represents the cross, while the animal represents Jesus, the ultimate sacrifice (John 1:29). - The laver points to Jesus as the Living Water cleansing me from sin and giving me a new birth through the Holy Spirit (John 4:10; Titus 3:5)—of which baptism is a symbol (Romans 6:3-7). - The candlestick points to Jesus as the Light of the world (John 1:9; 9:5), while its oil represents the Holy Spirit (Zechariah 4:1-6; Revelation 4:5), with whom I am invited to be filled (Luke 11:13). - The showbread is a symbol of Jesus being the Bread of Life (John 6:48, 51), which I an invited to internalize by reading His Word—the Bible (Matthew 4:4). - The altar of incense represents the righteousness of Jesus mixed with the prayers of God’s people (Revelation 5:8; 8:3). - The ark of the covenant represents God’s throne in heaven (Psalm 80:1), but there is more to it. Because God’s Ten Commandments were inside the ark, it shows how His law of love, which is a reflection of His character, is the foundation of His government. But since the mercy seat was over the Ten Commandments, it also represents His mercy being extended, through the blood that was sprinkled on the seat by the priest (Leviticus 16:15-16), to those who confess and forsake sin after breaking His law. It’s beautiful! And of course, the sprinkled blood was a symbol of Jesus’ blood shed on behalf of all people (Matthew 26:28). Do I have a High Priest today? “But Christ being come an high priest of good things to come, by a greater and more perfect tabernacle, not made with hands, that is to say, not of this building; neither by the blood of goats and calves, but by his own blood he entered in once into the holy place, having obtained eternal redemption for us.” —Hebrews 9:11-12 “For there is one God, and one mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus.” —1 Timothy 2:15 The sprinkling of blood by the priest foreshadowed Jesus’ current ministry in the heavenly sanctuary that He started after rising from the dead and returning to heaven. He is now my High Priest, presenting His own blood for my sins so they can be forgiven when I confess them in His name (1 John 1:9). In other words, the salvation process did not end at the cross but continues to this day in the heavenly sanctuary. Just like the priest was the mediator between God and sinners in the earthly sanctuary, Jesus is now our Mediator, the link between our human weakness and God’s divine power, reconciling us to God. What does this reconciliation entail? “Seeing then that we have a great high priest, that is passed into the heavens, Jesus the Son of God, let us hold fast our profession.” —Hebrews 4:14 “Wherefore he is able also to save them to the uttermost that come unto God by him, seeing he ever liveth to make intercession for them.” —Hebrews 7:25 “Being justified freely by his grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus: whom God hath set forth to be a propitiation through faith in his blood, to declare his righteousness for the remission of sins that are past, through the forbearance of God.” —Romans 3:24-25 “Who gave himself for us, that he might redeem us from all iniquity, and purify unto himself a peculiar people, zealous of good works.” —Titus 2:14 “For it is God which worketh in you both to will and to do of his good pleasure.” —Philippians 2:13 As my High Priest, Jesus accomplishes two amazing miracles when I genuinely confess my sins against Him and fully surrender my heart to Him: His perfect life is first imputed to me (I receive credit for it), allowing Him to wipe my sinful record clean, then its imparted to me (becomes a part of me) through a new birth, enabling me to live a life of victory in the present (John 3:3-6)! These two miracles make me righteous before God, which is something I can never accomplish through my own efforts (Acts 4:12). This is righteousness by faith—trusting my Savior to do for me and in me what I can never do for and in myself. What promises does God give regarding righteousness? There are several promises God gives me: - If I confess my sins, He will forgive them by ascribing Jesus’ sinless life and atoning death to me, thereby removing the death sentence from me and counting me as guiltless (1 John 1:9; Isaiah 1:18; 44:22; 2 Corinthians 5:21). - He promises to restore His image in me that was lost in Eden by giving me a new heart (Romans 8:29; Genesis 1:26-27; Ezekiel 36:25-27). - He promises to give me the desire and the power to live righteously (Philippians 2:13; Hebrews 13:20-21). - He will remain faithful to His work of restoring His image in me until I stand before His throne in heaven (Philippians 1:6; Jude 1:24). Do I have a role to play in this? “Not every one that saith unto me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of heaven; but he that doeth the will of my Father which is in heaven.” —Matthew 7:21 The promises mentioned above can become a reality only if I give Jesus the permission to perform them by making Him the Ruler of my life, and this commitment needs to be renewed every day (1 Corinthians 15:31; Luke 9:23) because He can continue His work in me only if I continue to cooperate with and remain fully surrendered to Him. This involves choosing to die to self daily because my carnal, selfish nature is naturally in enmity against God (Romans 8:5-9), but Jesus’ life was one of selflessness, so He calls me to follow Him (John 12:26; 1 Peter 2:21) even though the natural desire is to go my own way (Isaiah 53:6). He compares the surrender of self to getting an eye plucked out or a hand cut off (Matthew 5:29-30) because sin is addictive and selfishness is natural, but it can and will be overcome, by God’s power (Mark 10:26-27), in the lives of those whom Jesus calls His own. In another place, He compares His life of self denial to a narrow path (Matthew 7:13-14), so clearly this is not the path chosen by the majority. This is why a mere profession of faith in a life of conscious rebellion against His law is, ultimately, a shallow profession (1 John 2:3-6). Jesus shares heaven with those who share His selfless character, and this is a miracle only He can perform, but only if I give Him full control of my life (Matthew 19:27). What was the Day of Atonement? “Also on the tenth day of this seventh month there shall be a day of atonement: it shall be an holy convocation unto you; and ye shall afflict your souls, and offer an offering made by fire unto the LORD.” —Leviticus 23:27 The Day of Atonement (Yom Kippur) was a yearly occurance and the only time the High Priest entered the Most Holy Place. It was a solemn day of judgment, introspection, and repentance to ensure there was no unconfessed sin in one’s life. Anyone who refused to separate from sin was cut off from the camp of Israel (Leviticus 23:29). During this day the sanctuary was cleansed from the sins that had been trasferred there throughout the year because as the people offered sacrifices for sin, their sin was then symbolically transferred to the lamb, from the lamb to the priest, and, finally, from the priest to the sanctuary itself. How was the sanctuary cleansed? “And he shall take the two goats, and present them before the LORD at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation. And Aaron shall cast lots upon the two goats; one lot for the LORD, and the other lot for the scapegoat. And Aaron shall bring the goat upon which the LORD’S lot fell, and offer him for a sin offering. But the goat, on which the lot fell to be the scapegoat, shall be presented alive before the LORD, to make an atonement with him, and to let him go for a scapegoat into the wilderness.” —Leviticus 16:7-10 “And this shall be a statute for ever unto you: that in the seventh month, on the tenth day of the month, ye shall afflict your souls, and do no work at all, whether it be one of your own country, or a stranger that sojourneth among you: For on that day shall the priest make an atonement for you, to cleanse you, that ye may be clean from all your sins before the LORD.” —Leviticus 16:29-30 Once a year, on the Day of Atonement, two goats were selected. The Lord’s goat was killed as a sacrifice for the sins of God’s people (Leviticus 16:9), and the blood was taken by the high priest into the Most Holy Place and sprinkled upon and before the mercy seat (Leviticus 16:14). This represented the blood of Jesus and the mercy of God available to anyone who chooses to confess and forsake sin. God accepted the sprinkled blood, and the confessed sins of the people were then transferred from the sanctuary to the high priest, who then transferred them to the second goat—the scapegoat, which represented Satan (Leviticus 16:8). In this manner the sanctuary was cleansed from the sins of the people transferred there throughout the year (Leviticus 16:30). The scapegoat was then led into the wilderness (Leviticus 16:21-22) where it died, representing Satan’s punishment for the sins of the world because after Jesus’ Second Coming, Satan will be confined to the uninhabited, desolate wilderness of earth for 1,000 years (Revelation 20:1-3), and at the end of this period, he will perish in the lake of fire (Revelation 20:10). What did the Day of Atonement foreshadow? “It was therefore necessary that the patterns of things in the heavens should be purified with these; but the heavenly things themselves with better sacrifices than these.” —Hebrews 9:23 Since the earthly sanctuary and it’s services were a foreshadow of the heavenly sanctuary, the Day of Atonement was pointing to the cleansing of the heavenly sanctuary by the real High Priest, Jesus Christ, the real Mediator between God and man (1 Timothy 2:5) who offers forgiveness and cleansing from sin to anyone who exercises faith in His substitutionary sacrifice. In the broadest aspect, the Day of Atonement lead to sin being eradicated from the camp of Israel, which pointed to a future time when sin would be eradicated from the universe forever. Then and only then will the atonement be completed and the universe restored to its pre-sin state. The story of the sanctuary, therefore, is far reaching and all-encompassing, covering the entire history of the human race, from the fall of Adam and Eve in Eden to the restoration of the fallen race in the new heavenly Eden! What makes Jesus the perfect High Priest? “Therefore, in all things He had to be made like His brethren, that He might be a merciful and faithful High Priest in things pertaining to God, to make propitiation for the sins of the people. For in that He Himself has suffered, being tempted, He is able to aid those who are tempted.” —Hebrews 2:17-18, NKJV “For we do not have a High Priest who cannot sympathize with our weaknesses, but was in all points tempted as we are, yet without sin. Let us therefore come boldly to the throne of grace, that we may obtain mercy and find grace to help in time of need.” —Hebrews 4:15-16 Because Jesus was born in human flesh, He experienced all of the temptations that we experience, and because He knows what it feels like to wrestle with sin, He is full of mercy and compassion toward anyone who comes to Him in confession and repentence. Because He successfully resisted temptation (1 John 3:5) and gained victory over sin, He is ever ready to help me overcome sin in my own life. He wants me to experience an abundant life (John 10:10) that is free from the power of sin (John 8:31-31). The pain, misery, and suffering of sin was never a part of His plan for us. The human race brought it into the world, and the sanctuary shows that God takes it very seriously. His justice cannot excuse it, but, in His mercy, He also takes the burden of providing a way out of it entirely upon Himself, and He gives the remedy—freely—to anyone willing to take it. He is our merciful High Priest who shed His own blood so our record of sin could be blotted out. The only question is have you accepted His offer of mercy? Have your sins been covered by the blood of the Lamb?\"},\"23\":{\"title\":\"Surrendering the Fight\",\"url\":\"/gospel/surrender/\",\"category\":\"Gospel\",\"description\":\"Knowingly or unknowingly, every person on earth is waging a losing war, and surrender is the only way out.\",\"body\":\"What is the war of all wars? “To wit, that God was in Christ, reconciling the world unto himself, not imputing their trespasses unto them; and hath committed unto us the word of reconciliation.” —2 Corinthians 5:19 “Stand therefore, having your loins girt about with truth, and having on the breastplate of righteousness; and your feet shod with the preparation of the gospel of peace.” —Ephesians 6:14-15 Ever since Lucifer chose to exercise his freedom of choice to exalt self above God, the dissonant note of selfishness has marred the perfect harmony of God’s government. When Lucifer succeeded in infecting Adam and Eve with this virus of self-exaltation, a war began to rage in the heart of every human being between self and God. The way God has handled this rebellion against Himself and His legitimate authority, by risking everything in order to reconcile the human race back to Himself through the sacrifice of His only Son, Jesus Christ, has shone new light on the justice of His governemnt and the mercy of His character. After His ascension, Jesus committed this work of reconciliation, the proclamation of the gospel of peace, to His followers so that every human being would have the opportunity to be reconciled to God, because the truth is every person is at war with his or her Creator, knowingly or unknowingly, until the decision is made to surrender the fight. How do I know whom I serve? “Know ye not, that to whom ye yield yourselves servants to obey, his servants ye are to whom ye obey; whether of sin unto death, or of obedience unto righteousness?” —Romans 6:16 The Bible presents only two sides for us to choose from: God or Satan, good or evil, righteousness or sin, selflessness or selfishness, life or death. The side we yield, or surrender, to is the side we choose to serve. Our loving Father, Creator, and Reedemer invites us to surrender our will to Him moment by moment because His will for our lives is better, higher, and grander than our own (Isaiah 55:8-9). Did Jesus demonstrate this concept in His life? “And he went a little further, and fell on his face, and prayed, saying, O my Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me: nevertheless not as I will, but as thou wilt.” —Matthew 26:39 Just before His betrayal by Judas, Jesus went through the darkest time of His earthly life while He contemplated the events He had to soon pass through, but even though His humanity shrank from the suffering, humiliation, and the weight of sin He had to bear for every human being, He chose to follow the will of His Father rather than His own. In doing so, He opened the door of blessing, reconciliation, and salvation to every member of the human family. How does Paul describe our human condition? “For I know that in me (that is, in my flesh,) dwelleth no good thing: for to will is present with me; but how to perform that which is good I find not. For the good that I would I do not: but the evil which I would not, that I do.” —Romans 7:18-19 Our fallen human nature makes it natural for us to live for self rather than for God. We may have the desire to live for God but fall short in our ability to do it. Is there a solution? “But thanks be to God, which giveth us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ.” —1 Corinthians 15:57 “For we ourselves also were sometimes foolish, disobedient, deceived, serving divers lusts and pleasures, living in malice and envy, hateful, and hating one another. But after that the kindness and love of God our Saviour toward man appeared, not by works of righteousness which we have done, but according to his mercy he saved us, by the washing of regeneration, and renewing of the Holy Ghost; which he shed on us abundantly through Jesus Christ our Saviour; that being justified by his grace, we should be made heirs according to the hope of eternal life.” —Titus 3:3-7 “For if ye live after the flesh, ye shall die: but if ye through the Spirit do mortify the deeds of the body, ye shall live.” —Romans 8:13 The good news is Jesus Christ, through the regenerating, renewing power of the Holy Spirit, gives us the ability to experience victory in the battle against self, allowing us to live in harmony with the will of God! What does this look like in practice? “There is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit.” —Romans 8:1 “This I say then, Walk in the Spirit, and ye shall not fulfil the lust of the flesh. For the flesh lusteth against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh: and these are contrary the one to the other: so that ye cannot do the things that ye would. But if ye be led of the Spirit, ye are not under the law.” —Galatians 5:16-18 Every day we make a choice whether we are guided by our own desires and inclinations (the flesh) or by the Spirit of God. We receive freedom from the slavery of selfishness and sinfulness only when we choose to walk in the Spirit, being guided by it moment by moment. When this happens, we give God permission to carry out His will in our lives. What metaphor did Paul use to describe this? “I am crucified with Christ: nevertheless I live; yet not I, but Christ liveth in me: and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God, who loved me, and gave himself for me.” —Galatians 2:20 “But God forbid that I should glory, save in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom the world is crucified unto me, and I unto the world.” —Galatians 6:14 “And they that are Christ’s have crucified the flesh with the affections and lusts.” —Galatians 5:24 We begin walking in the Spirit when we choose to surrender to God, which Paul describes as a crucifixion of, or death to, self. Putting away self, which is in conflict with the Spirit, allows Christ to live His life in us by faith, and we then become a new creation in Jesus (2 Corinthians 5:17)! What is a symbol of this death? “Know ye not, that so many of us as were baptized into Jesus Christ were baptized into his death? Therefore we are buried with him by baptism into death: that like as Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the Father, even so we also should walk in newness of life. For if we have been planted together in the likeness of his death, we shall be also in the likeness of his resurrection: knowing this, that our old man is crucified with him, that the body of sin might be destroyed, that henceforth we should not serve sin. For he that is dead is freed from sin.” —Romans 6:3-7 The decision to give our life over to Jesus is synonymous we the decision to die to self because that is the only way He can reign on the throne of our heart. Baptism is a beautiful symbol of this burial of self, along with the old life of sin, demonstrated by the submersion into water, and of the resurrection from that burial to a new life in Jesus, demonstrated by the coming out of water. Is death to self a one-time occurance? “And he said to them all, If any man will come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross daily, and follow me.” —Luke 9:23 “I protest by your rejoicing which I have in Christ Jesus our Lord, I die daily.” —1 Corinthians 15:31 Jesus says that those who desire to follow Him will make a daily decision to deny self. Paul echoes this when he says that death to self is a daily occurance for him, not a one-time experience, because it is the consistent connection with Christ that recreates His character in His people. What is the process of growth compared to? “For the earth bringeth forth fruit of herself; first the blade, then the ear, after that the full corn in the ear.” —Mark 4:28 Growing in Christ is the work of a lifetime, and it’s truly His work, made possible by a daily surrender to Him. As long as we continue to cooperate with God, He will continue to grow us in grace, leading us into a deeper relationship with Him as He molds our characters to more accurately reflect His own. Receiving the righteous, loving character of Jesus is the greatest privilege and honor of every human being. What is God’s reaction when I fall short? “For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God.” —Romans 3:23 “For a just man falleth seven times, and riseth up again: but the wicked shall fall into mischief.” —Proverbs 24:16 “My little children, these things write I unto you, that ye sin not. And if any man sin, we have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous: and he is the propitiation for our sins: and not for ours only, but also for the sins of the whole world.” —1 John 2:1-2 God is gracious and merciful; He does not give up on us when we make mistakes! He is always willing to forgive the repentant person, and Jesus Christ, our Advocate in heaven, is ready to cover our shortcomings with His own righteousness, pleading His own blood on our behalf, when we genuinely repent of our sins. When learning to walk it’s not unusual for a child to fall down, but problems arise when the child stops getting up. Such a state of discouragement is Satan’s ultimate goal. But God is a patient, loving parent, who stoops down to meet us where we are, always ready to lift us back up if we stretch out our hand to Him (Micah 7:7-8). Of course, we don’t want to abuse His grace and become presumptuous by choosing to cling to sin, because the wages of sin is death (Romans 3:23). Sin is so serious that the Father had to give up His own Son to a death on the cross because of it. The repentant sinner who truly loves Jesus and appreciates His sacrifice will develop a hatred of sin. What takes place in a fully surrendered life? “For it is God which worketh in you both to will and to do of his good pleasure.” —Philippians 2:13 “Know ye not, that to whom ye yield yourselves servants to obey, his servants ye are to whom ye obey; whether of sin unto death, or of obedience unto righteousness?” —Romans 6:16 When we yield ourselves to Christ, He starts living and working in us, giving us both the willingness and the ability to do His will. This is the gospel, the good news of forgiveness, cleansing, and restoration that Jesus has made freely available to anyone who asks for it! If Jesus could restore the demoniac (Mark 5:1-15), He can restore anybody from the most hopeless circumstances. How does Jesus live in us? “And I will pray the Father, and he shall give you another Comforter, that he may abide with you for ever; even the Spirit of truth; whom the world cannot receive, because it seeth him not, neither knoweth him: but ye know him; for he dwelleth with you, and shall be in you. I will not leave you comfortless: I will come to you.” —John 14:16-18 “Finally, my brethren, be strong in the Lord, and in the power of his might. Put on the whole armour of God, that ye may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil.” —Ephesians 6:10-11 When Jesus talked about His Father sending the Holy Spirit, He equated the Spirit with His own presence because He said “I will come to you.” We’ve already learned that we have victory over self through Jesus Christ, and now we know He dwells in us through the gift of the Holy Spirit. So it is His power and His armor, not our own, that makes us strong, enabling us to live a life that’s pleasing to Him. How can I receive the gift of the Holy Spirit? “Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and ye shall find; knock, and it shall be opened unto you.” —Matthew 7:7 “If ye then, being evil, know how to give good gifts unto your children: how much more shall your heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to them that ask him?” —Luke 11:13 God is with us, not against us; He wants us to succeed in our Christian walk. His great desire is to give His Spirit to all who recognize their need of Divine help. We just have to ask! What is God after? “And be not conformed to this world: but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind, that ye may prove what is that good, and acceptable, and perfect, will of God.” —Romans 12:2 “Then will I sprinkle clean water upon you, and ye shall be clean: from all your filthiness, and from all your idols, will I cleanse you. A new heart also will I give you, and a new spirit will I put within you: and I will take away the stony heart out of your flesh, and I will give you an heart of flesh. And I will put my spirit within you, and cause you to walk in my statutes, and ye shall keep my judgments, and do them.” —Ezekiel 36:25-27 The transformation of character—the renewal of mind and the purifying of heart—is what God is after. He cannot do this without our cooperation, without a total surrender of our will to Him, but to those who ask Him to take their life as they cling to His promise and power to transform, Jesus gives the same assurance He gave to the suffering woman, “be of good comfort: thy faith hath made thee whole” (Luke 8:48). What other promises do we have? “Being confident of this very thing, that he which hath begun a good work in you will perform it until the day of Jesus Christ.” —Philippians 1:6 “Now unto him that is able to keep you from falling, and to present you faultless before the presence of his glory with exceeding joy, to the only wise God our Saviour, be glory and majesty, dominion and power, both now and ever. Amen.” —Jude 1:24-25 “And the very God of peace sanctify you wholly; and I pray God your whole spirit and soul and body be preserved blameless unto the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ. Faithful is he that calleth you, who also will do it.” —1 Thessalonians 5:23-24 As long as we continue to choose Christ daily, we are complete in Him (Colossians 2:10), who gives us help and power, who has promised to perform the work He has begun in our hearts, and to present us faultless before His glory! What is the plan of salvation really about? “And they shall see his face; and his name shall be in their foreheads.” —Revelation 22:4 “And the LORD descended in the cloud, and stood with him there, and proclaimed the name of the LORD. And the LORD passed by before him, and proclaimed, The LORD, The LORD God, merciful and gracious, longsuffering, and abundant in goodness and truth, keeping mercy for thousands, forgiving iniquity and transgression and sin, and that will by no means clear the guilty; visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children, and upon the children’s children, unto the third and to the fourth generation.” —Exodus 34:5-7 “Let this mind be in you, which was also in Christ Jesus.” —Philippians 2:5 Salvation goes beyond justification by faith in Jesus and includes sanctification, also by faith (1 Corinthians 6:9-11). Yes, it’s about the gift of eternal life (John 3:16), but it’s also about total freedom from the degrading power of sin, total restoration of the image of God in fallen humanity. Following Christ goes beyond the knowledge of, and belief in, truth as revealed in His Word. Christianity is the complete, total surrender to the will of God, so that He can write His name—the attributes of His character—on our foreheads, a symbol for our mind. Fallen humanity redeemed to reflect the beauty of God’s character is the great aim of the plan of redemption (2 Peter 1:4). What an honor!\",\"series\":\"Experiencing Salvation\"},\"24\":{\"title\":\"Victory Over Sin\",\"url\":\"/gospel/victory/\",\"category\":\"Gospel\",\"description\":\"Is it possible to have victory over the power of sin, or is forgiveness of sin all there is to salvation?\",\"body\":\"What is God’s will regarding sin? “But your iniquities have separated between you and your God, and your sins have hid his face from you, that he will not hear.” —Isaiah 59:2 “And she shall bring forth a son, and thou shalt call his name JESUS: for he shall save his people from their sins.” —Matthew 1:21 “If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.” —1 John 1:9 “Who his own self bare our sins in his own body on the tree, that we, being dead to sins, should live unto righteousness: by whose stripes ye were healed.” —1 Peter 2:24 Before sin entered the world, Adam and Eve communicated with God face to face. Once they allowed sin to enter their hearts, it separated them from their Creator because sin cannot exist in the presence of a holy God—His presence is a consuming fire to those who cherish sin (Deuteronomy 4:24). The Father then sent His Son not only to pay the penalty for sin on our behalf, but also to save us from our sins. He wants to forgive and cleanse us from any and all unrighteousness so that we may be dead to sin and alive to righteousness! What is the first step to victory over sin? “And if it seem evil unto you to serve the LORD, choose you this day whom ye will serve; whether the gods which your fathers served that were on the other side of the flood, or the gods of the Amorites, in whose land ye dwell: but as for me and my house, we will serve the LORD.” —Joshua 24:15 Sin is a choice, an act of the will because the devil cannot force anyone to sin. I get to choose whom I will serve every single day. Now it’s true that will power without God is my own power, but an act of the will is the first step on the road to victory. Sin can be defeated only if I cooperate with God; He will do for me what I cannot do for myself, but I need to do my part by making a firm choice to serve Him. Jesus raised Lazarus from the dead, but He didn’t roll away the stone because people were capable of doing that themselves. There is also a huge difference between desiring to overcome and choosing to overcome. God is powerless to help me until I make that choice, so whenever temptation comes, my first response can be “No, I choose to serve Christ.” What is the second step? “But thanks be to God, which giveth us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ.” —1 Corinthians 15:57 “And Jesus answering saith unto them, Have faith in God. For verily I say unto you, That whosoever shall say unto this mountain, Be thou removed, and be thou cast into the sea; and shall not doubt in his heart, but shall believe that those things which he saith shall come to pass; he shall have whatsoever he saith. Therefore I say unto you, What things soever ye desire, when ye pray, believe that ye receive them, and ye shall have them.” —Mark 11:22-24 “And this is the confidence that we have in him, that, if we ask any thing according to his will, he heareth us. And if we know that he hear us, whatsoever we ask, we know that we have the petitions that we desired of him.” —1 John 5:14-15 The Bible is clear that it’s God will for me to have victory over sin. The Bible also says anything that I ask in faith according to His will He will do, and Paul even encourages me to thank God for the victory He gives me through Jesus. Just like the Israelites gave a loud shout of victory before the walls of Jericho came down (Joshua 6:16), I can claim that victory by faith and thank God for it. Faith in the power of God is crucial; it is the difference between merely asking for victory and believing it. The victory is a gift that needs to be received and accepted. So after saying “No, I choose to serve Christ,” my second response to temptation can be “Thank you God for the victory that is mine through Jesus.” What is the third step? “Likewise reckon ye also yourselves to be dead indeed unto sin, but alive unto God through Jesus Christ our Lord. Let not sin therefore reign in your mortal body, that ye should obey it in the lusts thereof. Neither yield ye your members as instruments of unrighteousness unto sin: but yield yourselves unto God, as those that are alive from the dead, and your members as instruments of righteousness unto God. For sin shall not have dominion over you.” —Romans 6:11-14 Through the righteousness of Jesus and the power of the Holy Spirit in me I can be dead to sin. Temptation has no power over a corpse, and I can be just as dead to it. After thanking God for the victory, I can follow it up with “I am dead to this sin.” And remember, dying to sin is not divorcing a best friend, but an evil enemy. It is a cause for joy and celebration! So do not crawl, but run from it like Joseph did (Genesis 39:12). Is it smart to dwell on the temptation? “Blessed is the man that endureth temptation: for when he is tried, he shall receive the crown of life, which the Lord hath promised to them that love him. Let no man say when he is tempted, I am tempted of God: for God cannot be tempted with evil, neither tempteth he any man: but every man is tempted, when he is drawn away of his own lust, and enticed. Then when lust hath conceived, it bringeth forth sin: and sin, when it is finished, bringeth forth death.” —James 1:12-15 “Wherefore gird up the loins of your mind, be sober, and hope to the end for the grace that is to be brought unto you at the revelation of Jesus Christ.” —1 Peter 1:13 “Casting down imaginations, and every high thing that exalteth itself against the knowledge of God, and bringing into captivity every thought to the obedience of Christ.” —2 Corinthians 10:5 “For as he thinks in his heart, so is he.” —Proverns 23:7 Sin occurs when the door of the mind is opened, and it’s then let inside and entertained. Temptation becomes sin when it’s cherished in the mind and, in the words of James, allowed to conceive sin. Peter calls us to bind the mind, like a soldier binds his belt in preparation for action, so the mind is ready to deal with temptation. Paul tells us to bring every thought into captivity to Christ since a sinful thought immediately rejected does not have strength. The faster I turn to God the safer I am, and the more I do it the easier it gets. How did Jesus meet temptation? “And when the tempter came to him, he said, If thou be the Son of God, command that these stones be made bread. But he answered and said, It is written, Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God.” —Matthew 4:3-4 “For the word of God is living and powerful, and sharper than any two-edged sword, piercing even to the division of soul and spirit, and of joints and marrow, and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart.” —Hebrews 4:12, NKJV “Your word I have hidden in my heart, that I might not sin against You.” —Psalm 119:11 “But we all, with open face beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord, are changed into the same image from glory to glory, even as by the Spirit of the Lord.” —2 Corinthians 3:18 Jesus met temptation by quoting Scripture. Hebrews tells us the Bible is alive, powerful, and sharper than any sword. When I store His word in my mind by reading it daily and memorizing favorite passages, I am “girding” up my mind. Furthermore, I become what I behold, so by beholding the character of Christ as revealed in His word, my character will be transformed to reflect His character through the work of the Holy Spirit. The next time temptation comes, let’s follow the example of our Redeemer and turn to the Bible to give us victory! How can I reduce temptation? “But put ye on the Lord Jesus Christ, and make not provision for the flesh, to fulfil the lusts thereof.” —Romans 13:14 “This I say then, Walk in the Spirit, and ye shall not fulfil the lust of the flesh.” —Galatians 5:16 “Commit thy works unto the LORD, and thy thoughts shall be established.” —Proverbs 16:3 “And if thy right hand offend thee, cut it off, and cast it from thee: for it is profitable for thee that one of thy members should perish, and not that thy whole body should be cast into hell.” —Matthew 5:30 The Bible invites me to “put on Christ” and “walk in the Spirit.” I do this by beginning every day sitting at His feet, like Mary did (Luke 10:39), reading His Word and asking Him to convert my heart and mind. Then I commit my will to Him for that day. And then I “make no provision for the flesh” by removing myself from temptation and doing all that I can to create an environment that is free from it. When I leave room for temptation I am telling myself I will fail, so throw it out, pour it out, delete the app, cancel the subscription, cut the cable. What is God’s promise? “There hath no temptation taken you but such as is common to man: but God is faithful, who will not suffer you to be tempted above that ye are able; but will with the temptation also make a way to escape, that ye may be able to bear it.” —1 Corinthians 10:13 We saw in James 1:12 that God does not tempt anyone, but now we have a promise that He will not allow us to be tested beyond what we are able to bear! He provides a way of escape for every temptation the devil throws at us! What if I’ve struggled with the same sin for years? “For the weapons of our warfare are not carnal, but mighty through God to the pulling down of strong holds.” —2 Corinthians 10:4 “I can do all things through Christ which strengtheneth me.” —Philippians 4:13 “For a righteous person falls seven times and rises again, but the wicked stumble in time of disaster.” —Proverbs 24:16 “And he arose, and came to his father. But when he was yet a great way off, his father saw him, and had compassion, and ran, and fell on his neck, and kissed him. And the son said unto him, Father, I have sinned against heaven, and in thy sight, and am no more worthy to be called thy son. But the father said to his servants, Bring forth the best robe, and put it on him; and put a ring on his hand, and shoes on his feet: and bring hither the fatted calf, and kill it; and let us eat, and be merry: for this my son was dead, and is alive again; he was lost, and is found. And they began to be merry.” —Luke 15:20-24 The walls of Jericho seemed insurmountable, and they were, as far as human strength was concerned (Numbers 13:28), but then the God of the universe got involved, and they crumbled like sand. The walls of sin in our lives are the same until we ask God to get involved and intervene on our behalf, and the promise is that Jesus Christ is mighty to pull them down! It’s not about how many times I’ve fallen, but whether I got up and went to the Father who is waiting for me with outstretched arms. I can never think of yourself as a hopeless case; it’s not from God. My past history is not my legacy or destiny. It’s not “I’d like to be an overcomer,” or “I hope to be.” Through the grace and power of Christ in my life I am an overcomer! What is the most powerful motivation for overcoming sin? “For the preaching of the cross is to them that perish foolishness; but unto us which are saved it is the power of God.” —1 Corinthians 1:18 “That Christ may dwell in your hearts by faith; that ye, being rooted and grounded in love, may be able to comprehend with all saints what is the breadth, and length, and depth, and height; and to know the love of Christ, which passeth knowledge, that ye might be filled with all the fulness of God.” —Ephesians 3:17-19 “We love him, because he first loved us.” —1 John 4:19 The more time I spend thinking about what Jesus did for me on the cross, the more my love for Him will grow and my abhorence for sin will increase. Sin is so evil that it required the Son of God to leave the courts of heaven, take on human nature, live a perfect life while assailed by the devil on every side, and die the death of the worse criminal on the cross because the Creator God was the only One who could pay the penalty for my sins. Let’s get grounded in the love of Christ as revealed on the cross, so it becomes the driving motivation for victory over sin. The more I love Him the more I’ll hate those things that separate me from Him and are repulsive to His character. What does Revelation say about those who overcome? “And they overcame him by the blood of the Lamb, and by the word of their testimony; and they loved not their lives unto the death.” —Revelation 12:11 “To him that overcometh will I grant to sit with me on my throne, even as I also overcame, and am set down with my Father on his throne.” —Revelation 3:21 “The four and twenty elders fall down before him that sat on the throne, and worship him that liveth for ever and ever, and cast their crowns before the throne, saying, Thou art worthy, O Lord, to receive glory and honour and power: for thou hast created all things, and for thy pleasure they are and were created.” —Revelation 4:10-11 There is power in what Jesus did on the cross because Revelation says the saints overcame Satan by the blood of Jesus Christ. He gives them the victory, and then He grants them to sit on His throne! This is an echo of how the Father treated His prodigal son. Such treatment is completely undeserved, but He does it anyway out of His immeasurable love for His children. No wonder the saints in heaven will cast their crowns before His throne in worship and adoration saying that He is worthy to receive glory, honor, and power.

And four great beasts came up from the sea, diverse one from another.” —Daniel 7:1-3 What is a beast in Bible prophecy? “Thus he said, The fourth beast shall be the fourth kingdom upon earth, which shall be diverse from all kingdoms, and shall devour the whole earth, and shall tread it down, and break it in pieces.” —Daniel 7:23 Beasts in Bible prophecy represent earthly kingdoms, and they are a fitting symbol because throughout history, these kingdoms have been distinguished by cruelty, force, and oppression. In contrast, Revelation portrays king Jesus as a Lamb (Revelation 5:13; 12:11; 17:14) because He is guided by love and gentleness. Instead of imposing His will by force, He stands at the door of the heart and knocks (Revelation 3:20), waiting to be let inside.

In Daniel 2, the first kingdom represented by the head of gold was also Babylon. The Bible operates on the principle of repetition where previously covered subjects are repeated and new details added, and so Daniel 7 covers the same kingdoms as Daniel 2, but adds more details to each. What was the second beast? “And behold another beast, a second, like to a bear, and it raised up itself on one side, and it had three ribs in the mouth of it between the teeth of it: and they said thus unto it, Arise, devour much flesh.” —Daniel 7:5 Babylon was eventually conquered by Medo-Persia, which is symbolized by a bear raised up on one side because this second empire was made up of two groups of people—the Medes, who came up first, and the Persians, who eventually became stronger. The three ribs in the mouth of the bear represent the three main powers conquered by Medo-Persia: Lydia, Babylon, and Egypt. By the way, in Daniel 8:3 Medo-Persia is symbolized by a ram with two-horns, but one of them was higher than the other and came up last; then in Daniel 8:20 this empire is called by name. What was the third beast? “After this I beheld, and lo another, like a leopard, which had upon the back of it four wings of a fowl; the beast had also four heads; and dominion was given to it.” —Daniel 7:6 The Medo-Persian empire was then conquered by Greece, which is symbolized by a leopard with four wings and four heads. Wings in the Bible represent speed (Jeremiah 4:11-13), and the four wings are a fitting representation for the speed with which Alexander the Great conquered. The four heads represent the four kingdoms into which the empire was divided when Alexanded died. What was the fourth beast? “After this I saw in the night visions, and behold a fourth beast, dreadful and terrible, and strong exceedingly; and it had great iron teeth: it devoured and brake in pieces, and stamped the residue with the feet of it: and it was diverse from all the beasts that were before it; and it had ten horns.” —Daniel 7:7 “And the ten horns out of this kingdom are ten kings that shall arise: and another shall rise after them; and he shall be diverse from the first, and he shall subdue three kings.” —Daniel 7:24 Greece was eventually conquered by the Roman Empire, which is symbolized by the fourth beast with 10 horns. The 10 horns represent the 10 kingdoms into which Rome was eventually split by the barbarian tribes: Visigoths (Spain), Anglo-Saxons (England), Franks (France), Alemani (Germany), Burgundians (Switzerland), Lombards (Italy), Suevi (Portugal), Heruli, Ostrogoths, and Vandals. These are the same kingdoms that were represented by the ten toes of the image in Daniel 2:41-44. What happens next? “I considered the horns, and, behold, there came up among them another little horn, before whom there were three of the first horns plucked up by the roots: and, behold, in this horn were eyes like the eyes of man, and a mouth speaking great things.” —Daniel 7:8 Another power appears symbolized by a little horn. We will see that all of the characteristics that the Bible gives it clearly identify it as the antichrist, which is defined in one of two ways: opposition to Christ or acting in place of Christ. What characteristics does this little horn power have? “After this I saw in the night visions, and behold a fourth beast, dreadful and terrible, and strong exceedingly; and it had great iron teeth: it devoured and brake in pieces, and stamped the residue with the feet of it: and it was diverse from all the beasts that were before it; and it had ten horns. I considered the horns, and, behold, there came up among them another little horn, before whom there were three of the first horns plucked up by the roots: and, behold, in this horn were eyes like the eyes of man, and a mouth speaking great things.” —Daniel 7:7-8 “I beheld, and the same horn made war with the saints, and prevailed against them.” —Daniel 7:21 “And the ten horns out of this kingdom are ten kings that shall arise: and another shall rise after them; and he shall be diverse from the first, and he shall subdue three kings. And he shall speak great words against the most High, and shall wear out the saints of the most High, and think to change times and laws: and they shall be given into his hand until a time and times and the dividing of time.” —Daniel 7:24-25 The Bible gives nine clear characteristics to identify the antichrist: 1. the little horn would come up somewhere amomg the 10 kingdoms of Western Europe (Daniel 7:8), 1. It would have a man at its head speaking for it (Daniel 7:8), 1. It would uproot three kingdoms (Daniel 7:8), 1. It would emerge from the fourth kingdom—the pagan Roman Empire (Daniel 7:7-8), 1. It would make war with the saints (Daniel 7:21), 1. It would be different from the 10 other kingdoms (Daniel 7:24), 1. It would persecute the saints for “a time and times and the dividing of time” (Daniel 7:25), 1. It would “speak great words against” (blaspheme) God (Daniel 7:25), 1. It would attempt “to change times and laws” (Daniel 7:25). What power fits these characteristics? Historians would be able to quickly identify the power being described because there is only one that fits them all—the papacy. Now it is important to emphasize that this is not a condemnation of Roman Catholics; rather, the Bible is pointing out a system—Catholicism. In other places the Bible also points out the faults of the Jewish and Protestant faiths. Moreover, God has devoted Christians in all churches, including the Roman Catholic church. It is also true that the papacy has done many good deeds for the poor and the needy, but she has also committed serious errors that the Bible clearly points out in Daniel and in Revelation. God must sometimes chasten and rebuke because He wants us to be aware of error and compromise, and people who are truly loyal to Him will heed His warnings, no matter the faith. With this in mind, let’s examine each of the nine characteristics: 1. It came up among the 10 kingdoms of Western Europe. The papal power is in the heart of Western Europe in Rome, Italy. 1. It would have a man at its head speaking for it. The papacy has the pope at its head who speaks for it. 1. It would uproot three kingdoms. Most of the 10 kingdoms of Western Europe supported the papacy, but three of them did not: the Heruli, the Ostrogoths, and the Vandals. These had to be destroyed before the papacy could rise to power. The Heruli were eradicated in 493, the Vandals in 534, and the power of the Ostrogoths was curtailed in 538. 1. It would emerge from the fourth kingdom—the pagan Roman Empire. The papacy is a continuation of the pagan Roman Empire, and historians attest to this. “The mighty Catholic Church was little more than the Roman Empire baptized. … The very capital of the old Roman Empire became the capital of the Christian empire. The office of Pontifex Maximus was continued in that of the pope.” “Whatever Roman elements the barbarians and Arians left … [came] under the protection of the Bishop of Rome, who was the chief person there after the emperor’s disappearance. … The Roman church … pushed itself into the place of the Roman World-Empire, of which it is the actual continuation.” 1. It would make war with the saints. It is no secret that the Roman Catholic church killed millions of people whose religious convictions differed from hers, especially during the Dark Ages. “That the Church of Rome has shed more innocent blood than any other institution that has ever existed among mankind, will be questioned by no Protestant who has a competent knowledge of history.” 1. It would be different from the 10 other kingdoms. The papacy is different from the other secular powers in Europe in that it rose to power as a religious power. 1. It would persecute the saints for “a time and times and the dividing of time.” In the Bible a time is a year, times is two years, and half a time is half of a year, so this is a total of three and a half years. The Amplified Bible actually translates it as “three and one-half years.” This same period is also mentioned as 42 months in Revelation 11:2; 13:5, as well as 1,260 days in Revelation 11:3; 12:6, 14 (the Jewish calendar is 30 days). In the Bible one prophetic day equals one literal year (Ezekiel 4:6; Numbers 14:34), so the little horn would have power to persecute the saints for 1,260 years. The papacy gained this power in 538 when the Ostrogoths, the last of the opposing kingdoms, were uprooted, and it ruled until 1798 when Napoleon’s general, Berthier, took the pope captive. Thus, its 1,260 year rule from 538 to 1798 is a direct fulfillment of this prophecy. Matthew 24:21-22 mentions this period of persecution against the saints, saying no soul would have survived it if God did not shorten it, but He did shorten it, and the persecution ended well before 1798. 1. It would “speak great words against” (blaspheme) God. Daniel 7:25 (“speak great words against the most High”) is echoed by Revelation 13:5 (“speaking great things and blasphemies”), so speaking great words is equivalent to blasphemy, which has two definitions in the Bible: claiming to forgive sins (Luke 5:21), and claiming to be God (John 10:33). The papacy claims both of these things. “Does the Priest truly forgive the sins, or does he only declare that they are remitted? The Priest does really and truly forgive the sins in virtue of the power given to him by Christ.” “We [the popes] hold upon this earth the place of God Almighty.” “The pope is not only the representative of Jesus Christ, but he is Jesus Christ, Himself, hidden under the veil of flesh.” 1. It would attempt “to change times and laws.” This is a reference to the law of God, and there is only one commandment that is both a time and a law: the fourth commandment about keeping the seventh day Sabbath holy. Furthermore, there is also only one Lawgiver (James 4:12), the Creator of heaven and earth, and no one can actually change the law of God (Luke 16:17), but the papacy has thought to transfer the Sabbath from Saturday to Sunday, the first day of the week. In its catechisms, it has also removed the second commandment against the veneration of images, shortened the fourth commandment, and divided the tenth commandment into two. In other words, there are now two apparent lawgivers, with two different days of worship, but only one of them is legitimate—the seventh-day Sabbath of the Almighty God. There is no other organization but the papacy that fits all nine of the characteristics of the little horn power of Daniel 7. And this is not a new idea either because every Protestant reformer believed the papacy was the antichrist. Alexander Clarence Flick, The Rise of the Medieval Church, 148, 149.

Aren’t there many antichrists? “Little children, it is the last time: and as ye have heard that antichrist shall come, even now are there many antichrists; whereby we know that it is the last time. They went out from us, but they were not of us; for if they had been of us, they would no doubt have continued with us: but they went out, that they might be made manifest that they were not all of us. But ye have an unction from the Holy One, and ye know all things. I have not written unto you because ye know not the truth, but because ye know it, and that no lie is of the truth. Who is a liar but he that denieth that Jesus is the Christ? He is antichrist, that denieth the Father and the Son.” —1 John 2:18-22 It’s true that through out history many antichrists have worked against God, but there is only one entity, the papacy, that fulfills the traits of the little horn power, which makes the following claim, “we declare, we proclaim, we define that it is absolutely necessary for salvation that every human creature be subject to the Roman Pontiff,” despite the fact that salvation is a gift, by grace through faith (Ephesians 2:8-9). Some may expect the antichrist to openly oppose God, but the word “antichrist” has two meanings: opposition to Christ or acting in place of Christ. Ultimately, both actions seek to supplant God’s position and authority, which is a continuation of Satan’s original aim in heaven. Satan’s work of deception in the last days is much more effective when the antichrist appears spiritual and holy, but God, in His love, gave the prophecies of Daniel and Revelation to expose these deceptions so that people are not mislead. Many will follow antichrist (Revelation 13:3) thinking they are following Jesus, but those who test every teaching by the Bible (Isaiah 8:20) will follow the Lamb (Revelation 14:4). Unam Sanctum: Pope Boniface VIII: 1302 What should I do when encountering new teachings? “These were more noble than those in Thessalonica, in that they received the word with all readiness of mind, and searched the scriptures daily, whether those things were so.” —Acts 17:11 “To the law and to the testimony: if they speak not according to this word, it is because there is no light in them.” —Isaiah 8:20 When encountering a new teaching it’s crucial not to take someone else’s word, but to study the topic for myself to see if it’s in harmony with the Bible. What promise does Revelation give? “And they overcame him by the blood of the Lamb, and by the word of their testimony; and they loved not their lives unto the death.” —Revelation 12:11 “Abide in me, and I in you. As the branch cannot bear fruit of itself, except it abide in the vine; no more can ye, except ye abide in me. I am the vine, ye are the branches: He that abideth in me, and I in him, the same bringeth forth much fruit: for without me ye can do nothing.” —John 15:4-5 “Then spake Jesus again unto them, saying, I am the light of the world: he that followeth me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life.” —John 15:4-5 The good news is Satan is a defeated foe. Jesus has already won the battle between good and evil on the cross, and those who overcome Satan in the last days will do it only by the grace and power of Jesus in their lives. Jesus is the Light, and it is my privilege to know and follow Him by daily reading His love letter to me—the Bible; it will illuminate my path and expose darkness because Jesus does not want anyone to be deceived.\",\"series\":\"The Antichrist’s Mark\"},\"26\":{\"title\":\"Are You Part of Babylon?\",\"url\":\"/prophecy/babylon/\",\"category\":\"Prophecy\",\"description\":\"Revelation warns about it, and the plagues are poured out on it. What does Babylon represent?\",\"body\":\"What is the origin of Babylon? “And they said, Go to, let us build us a city and a tower, whose top may reach unto heaven; and let us make us a name, lest we be scattered abroad upon the face of the whole earth. And the LORD came down to see the city and the tower, which the children of men builded. And the LORD said, Behold, the people is one, and they have all one language; and this they begin to do: and now nothing will be restrained from them, which they have imagined to do. Go to, let us go down, and there confound their language, that they may not understand one another’s speech. So the LORD scattered them abroad from thence upon the face of all the earth: and they left off to build the city. Therefore is the name of it called Babel; because the LORD did there confound the language of all the earth: and from thence did the LORD scatter them abroad upon the face of all the earth.” —Genesis 11:4-9 “The king spake, and said, Is not this great Babylon, that I have built for the house of the kingdom by the might of my power, and for the honour of my majesty?” —Daniel 4:30 The word “Babylon” originated at the Tower of Babel because it was the place where God confounded language, leading to confusion and bringing construction to a halt. “Babylon” and “Babel” both mean “confusion.” Later on in the 600s BC, the pagan kingdom of Babylon arose and developed into an economic and religious center of the world. Its religion was characterized by idolatry, ancestor worship, and sun worship, and it became an enemy of God’s people, Israel (Jeremiah 39:6-7; 50:29-34; 51:34). Babylon was also marked by a boastful and prideful spirit, as seen in the Babylonian king’s boastful remark in Daniel 4:30. In fact, in Isaiah 14:4-22, God uses Babylon as a symbol of Satan due to its pride and wickedness. What kind of legacy did ancient Babylon leave behind? “Babylon hath been a golden cup in the LORD’s hand, that made all the earth drunken: the nations have drunken of her wine; therefore the nations are mad. Babylon is suddenly fallen and destroyed: howl for her; take balm for her pain, if so be she may be healed.” —Jeremiah 51:7-8 “Then they brought the golden vessels that were taken out of the temple of the house of God which was at Jerusalem; and the king, and his princes, his wives, and his concubines, drank in them. They drank wine, and praised the gods of gold, and of silver, of brass, of iron, of wood, and of stone.” —Daniel 5:3-4 Because of its power and influence in the world, Babylon made drunk, or confused, the nations of the world with its false pagan teachings, and due to its refusal to turn from its wickedness, idolatry, and persecution of God’s people, God allowed it to be destroyed (Daniel 4:30; Jeremiah 51:24, 47) by the Medo-Persians. On the night of its fall, the king of Babylon threw a party, during which he desecrated the holy vessels stolen from the temple of God in Jerusalem by drinking wine out of them and using them for the unholy worship of false gods. He ended up perishing that very night (Daniel 5:30). The Bible makes it clear in Isaiah 13:19-20 that ancient Babylon would never be rebuilt or inhabited again, so the Babylon of the book of Revelation is not a literal Babylon, but a spiritual one. How does Revelation describe Babylon? “And there came one of the seven angels which had the seven vials, and talked with me, saying unto me, Come hither; I will shew unto thee the judgment of the great whore that sitteth upon many waters: With whom the kings of the earth have committed fornication, and the inhabitants of the earth have been made drunk with the wine of her fornication. So he carried me away in the spirit into the wilderness: and I saw a woman sit upon a scarlet coloured beast, full of names of blasphemy, having seven heads and ten horns. And the woman was arrayed in purple and scarlet colour, and decked with gold and precious stones and pearls, having a golden cup in her hand full of abominations and filthiness of her fornication: And upon her forehead was a name written, MYSTERY, BABYLON THE GREAT, THE MOTHER OF HARLOTS AND ABOMINATIONS OF THE EARTH. And I saw the woman drunken with the blood of the saints, and with the blood of the martyrs of Jesus: and when I saw her, I wondered with great admiration.” —Revelation 17:1-6 “And the woman which thou sawest is that great city, which reigneth over the kings of the earth.” —Revelation 17:18 The Bible gives seven characteristics to describe Babylon: 1. She is called the “Mother of Harlots” (Revelation 17:5), 2. She persecutes the saints (Revelation 17:6), 3. She is dressed in purple and scarlet and decked with jewelry (Revelation 17:4), 4. She is sitting on a beast (Revelation 17:3), 5. She has worldwide influence (Revelation 17:1, 18), 6. The beast she’s sitting on has seven heads and ten horns (Revelation 17:3), 7. The beast is guilty of blasphemy (Revelation 17:3). What does a woman represent? “I have likened the daughter of Zion to a comely and delicate woman.” —Jeremiah 6:2 “And I have put my words in thy mouth, and I have covered thee in the shadow of mine hand, that I may plant the heavens, and lay the foundations of the earth, and say unto Zion, Thou art my people.” —Isaiah 51:16 “For this cause shall a man leave his father and mother, and shall be joined unto his wife, and they two shall be one flesh. This is a great mystery: but I speak concerning Christ and the church. Nevertheless let every one of you in particular so love his wife even as himself; and the wife see that she reverence her husband.” —Ephesians 5:31-33 “Let us be glad and rejoice, and give honour to him: for the marriage of the Lamb is come, and his wife hath made herself ready. And to her was granted that she should be arrayed in fine linen, clean and white: for the fine linen is the righteousness of saints.” —Revelation 19:7-8 “Son of man, cause Jerusalem to know her abominations … But thou didst trust in thine own beauty, and playedst the harlot because of thy renown, and pouredst out thy fornications on every one that passed by; his it was.” —Ezekiel 16:2, 15 In the Bible a woman represents the church. A pure woman is a pure church that is faithful to Jesus, while an impure woman, or a harlot, is an unfaithful, or fallen, church. In Revelation 19:7-8 the true church is portrayed as Christ’s bride, and her members are covered by and reflect the righteousness of Jesus. Who does the harlot represent? The Bible gives seven characteristics to identify the harlot of Revelation 17 as the papacy. Now it’s important to emphasize that this is not a condemnation of Roman Catholics; rather, the Bible is pointing out a system—Catholicism. In other places the Bible also points out the faults of the Jewish and Protestant faiths. Moreover, God has devoted Christians in all churches, including the Roman Catholic church. It is also true that the papacy has done many good deeds for the poor and the needy, but she has also committed serious errors that the Bible clearly points out in Daniel and in Revelation. God must sometimes chasten and rebuke because He wants us to be aware of error and compromise, and people who are truly loyal to Him will heed His warnings, no matter the faith. With this in mind, let’s examine each of the seven characteristics. 1. She is called the “Mother of Harlots.” There is only one church that calls itself the mother church—the Roman Catholic Church. A prominent Catholic priest has made the following point: “They [non-Catholics] have continued the custom [of Sunday-keeping], even though it rests upon the authority of the Catholic Church and not upon an explicit text in the Bible. That observance [Sunday-keeping] remains as a reminder of the Mother Church from which the non-Catholic sects broke away—like a boy running away from home but still carrying in his pocket a picture of his mother or a lock of her hair.” 1. She persecutes the saints. The papacy persecuted and killed millions of people during the Dark Ages for following their conscience. 1. She is dressed in purple and scarlet and decked with jewelry. The colors listed match those of papal vestments. Red is the robe color worn by Catholic cardinals, and purple is the color of royalty, often worn by the pope at significant events since he is considered to be Christ’s representative on earth. Revelation 18:7 confirms this when it says that Babylon considers herself a queen. She is also decked with gold, precious stones, and pearls, all of which point to great wealth, which can be seen in her ornate and extravagant cathedrals. The golden cup in her hand looks impressive on the outside, but the inside is full of abominations—or false teachings based on human tradition, which is elevated above the Bible. 1. She is sitting on a beast. A beast represents a kingdom or nation (Daniel 7:23), so the fact that she is sitting on the beast represents not just the union of church and state (though they remain separate entities), but power over the state and its policies. This was fulfilled in the Dark Ages when the papacy united with, and exercised power over, the state to implement her policies and persecute people who disagreed with her teachings. This will be repeated again in the last days. 1. She has worldwide influence. Her influence is not limited to just one civil government. Her sitting on many waters (Revelation 17:1, 15), which represent people and nations, shows her influence and power over them, and Revelation 17:18 confirms this again by saying that she reigns “over the kings of the earth.” The papacy fulfills this point too. According to historian Alexander Flick, by the 13th century the pope was “at least in theory … the ruler of the whole world in temporal and spiritual affairs.” 1. The beast she’s sitting on has seven heads and ten horns. The seven heads are seven mountains (Revelation 17:9), and Rome, the headquarters of the papacy, is known, and has been referred to by classical writers, as the City of Seven Hills. The ten horns represent the ten barbarian tribes that arose after the fall of the Roman Empire. 1. The beast is guilty of blasphemy. Blasphemy has two definitions in the Bible: claiming to forgive sins (Luke 5:21), and claiming to be God (John 10:33). The papacy is a continuation of the pagan Roman Empire, and just like the Roman emperors claimed to be gods, the popes claim to be the Vicars of Christ. There is no other earthly power that fulfills all of these characteristics. Many leaders of the Reformation, including Huss, Wycliffe, Luther, Calvin, Zwingli, Melanchthon, Cranmer, Tyndale, Latimer, and Ridley, also agreed that the power described here is the papacy.

George Eldon Ladd, The Blessed Hope (Grand Rapids, MI: William B. Eerdman’s Publishing Co., 1956), pp. 32-34. Who are the harlot daughters? “And upon her forehead was a name written, MYSTERY, BABYLON THE GREAT, THE MOTHER OF HARLOTS AND ABOMINATIONS OF THE EARTH.” —Revelation 17:5 “Ye therefore, beloved, seeing ye know these things before, beware lest ye also, being led away with the error of the wicked, fall from your own stedfastness. But grow in grace, and in the knowledge of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ. To him be glory both now and for ever.” —2 Peter 3:17-18 “Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.” —John 14:6 Just as the harlot represents a fallen church, her daughters also represent fallen churches. Since the mother, just like ancient Babylon, has confused the world with her teachings, these daughter churches follow and teach the same key errors as the mother church. No woman, however, is born a harlot. These harlot daughters were originally undefiled and separate from the mother when during the great Protestant Reformation they protested her unbiblical teachings, but slowly, over time, they began to come back to her in acknowledgment of her authority and in agreement with her key teachings. This has led to them becoming fallen themselves and a part of spiritual Babylon. Peter uses the word “fallen” as another term to describe a turning away from truth and choosing to be led by error instead. He contrasts this with growing in grace and the knowledge of Jesus, which means that, ultimately, a fallen church turns her back on Jesus Himself because He is the truth. What is Babylon guilty of? “With whom the kings of the earth have committed fornication, and the inhabitants of the earth have been made drunk with the wine of her fornication.” —Revelation 17:2 “Ye adulterers and adulteresses, know ye not that the friendship of the world is enmity with God? whosoever therefore will be a friend of the world is the enemy of God.” —James 4:4 James describes spiritual adultery as a union with the world, and Revelation clearly shows that spiritual Babylon develops partnerships with earthly kings and uses the ways of the world (coercion) to win people to her side. We’ve already seen how the papacy united with the state in the Dark Ages to persecute, torture, and kill millions of people. God prohibits such a union because He never uses coercive measures to draw people to Himself; instead, He respectfully knocks at the door of the heart (Revelation 3:20) because He respects freedom of choice and wants people to follow Him out of love. He does not need the state to help bring people into His church; His love alone is powerful enough! The true church is loyal to Jesus only, but the papacy has turned away from her husband, Jesus, and formed illicit relationships with the state instead. What does this union lead to? “And an host was given him against the daily sacrifice by reason of transgression, and it cast down the truth to the ground; and it practised, and prospered.” —Daniel 8:12 “And the woman was arrayed in purple and scarlet colour, and decked with gold and precious stones and pearls, having a golden cup in her hand full of abominations and filthiness of her fornication.” —Revelation 17:4 “For all nations have drunk of the wine of the wrath of her fornication, and the kings of the earth have committed fornication with her, and the merchants of the earth are waxed rich through the abundance of her delicacies. … And they cast dust on their heads, and cried, weeping and wailing, saying, Alas, alas, that great city, wherein were made rich all that had ships in the sea by reason of her costliness! for in one hour is she made desolate.” —Revelation 18:3, 19 Whenever a church unites with the world, it results in a turning away from Bible truth. In Daniel 8:9-12 the little horn of Daniel 7:8, representing the papacy, is mentioned again, and the text says it casts truth to the ground and prospers. As the papacy replaced Bible truth with its own tradition and pagan teachings, it opened up the way to practices, like the selling of indulgences, that allowed it to acquire incredible wealth. In Revelation 18:11-13 this is confirmed when she’s mentioned as trafficking in the “souls of men” or, in other words, treating people as merchandise. No wonder she is decked with all kinds of expensive jewelry and holds a golden cup in Revelation 17:4. The next chapter then talks about ships in the sea and merchants being made rich because of her—a reference to economic advantages that lead to prosperity through some form of a partnership or alliance with her. Could this apply to large, global corporations, for example? What other powers are part of Babylon? “And I saw three unclean spirits like frogs come out of the mouth of the dragon, and out of the mouth of the beast, and out of the mouth of the false prophet. For they are the spirits of devils, working miracles, which go forth unto the kings of the earth and of the whole world, to gather them to the battle of that great day of God Almighty.” —Revelation 16:13-14 “And after these things I saw another angel come down from heaven, having great power; and the earth was lightened with his glory. And he cried mightily with a strong voice, saying, Babylon the great is fallen, is fallen, and is become the habitation of devils, and the hold of every foul spirit, and a cage of every unclean and hateful bird. For all nations have drunk of the wine of the wrath of her fornication, and the kings of the earth have committed fornication with her, and the merchants of the earth are waxed rich through the abundance of her delicacies.” —Revelation 18:1-3 There are three powers that come together: the dragon, the beast, and the false prophet. Revelation 12:9 tells us the dragon represents Satan working through pagan Rome when it tried to destroy Jesus at His birth (Revelation 12:4). Satan is also called the prince of this world in John 12:31, and his influence expands beyond pagan Rome. He has used ancient Egypt, Assyria, and Babylon to persecute God’s people, and we’ve learned he will use the U.S.A. and the papacy in the future. Because Revelation 13:8 says all the world will worship the beast in the last days, other world governments will be used too, as well as non-Christian religions, such as Islam, Buddhism, Hinduism, the New Age, etc. The second power, the beast, represents the papacy and the false prophet represents the apostate Protestantism of America. And so world governments and non-Christian religions, Roman Catholicism, and apostate Protestantism will form an alliance, called “Babylon the great” in Revelation 18:2, in the final battle against God, His followers, and His law. Note how the three powers of Revelation 16:13 are associated with unclean spirits, and Babylon is said to be the “hold of every foul spirit” in Revelation 18:2. What will unite these powers? “And I saw three unclean spirits like frogs come out of the mouth of the dragon, and out of the mouth of the beast, and out of the mouth of the false prophet. For they are the spirits of devils, working miracles, which go forth unto the kings of the earth and of the whole world, to gather them to the battle of that great day of God Almighty.” —Revelation 16:13-14 “And the light of a candle shall shine no more at all in thee; and the voice of the bridegroom and of the bride shall be heard no more at all in thee: for thy merchants were the great men of the earth; for by thy sorceries were all nations deceived.” —Revelation 18:23 “For there shall arise false Christs, and false prophets, and shall shew great signs and wonders; insomuch that, if it were possible, they shall deceive the very elect.” —Matthew 24:24 “Now the Spirit speaketh expressly, that in the latter times some shall depart from the faith, giving heed to seducing spirits, and doctrines of devils; speaking lies in hypocrisy; having their conscience seared with a hot iron.” —1 Timothy 4:1-2 “For such are false apostles, deceitful workers, transforming themselves into the apostles of Christ. And no marvel; for Satan himself is transformed into an angel of light.” —2 Corinthians 11:13-14 What the three powers of Revelation 16:13 have in common are the unclean spirits that come out of their mouths, and according to Revelation 16:14, these are spirits of devils working through miracles and sorcery. This is an echo of Christ’s warning about false Christs and false prophets working miracles, which means we can expect a counterfeit religious revival, supported by miracles, sorcery, and spiritism, just before Christ’s coming. Spiritism, a doctrine of Satan first introduced in Eden when he told Eve she would “not surely die” (Genesis 3:4), is the belief that the dead are alive and can contact the living. Incidentally, Catholicism prays to Mary and other dead saints; apostate Protestantism also believes the dead are not really dead but alive in heaven or hell; and non-Christian religions have a door open to spiritism through practices like “channeling” and spirit worship. And so when Satan and his angels pose as dead loves ones, prophets of old, angels of heaven, or even Christ Himself, while quoting a twisted version of the Scriptures, the deception will be overwhelming to anyone whose faith is not based on the Bible. What did ancient Babylon believe about death? “Then he brought me to the door of the gate of the LORD’S house which was toward the north; and, behold, there sat women weeping for Tammuz.” —Ezekiel 8:14 Tamuz was the god of food and vegetation worshiped by the Babylonians, who believed that he died each year when winter arrived but would be resurrected in the spring (immortality of the soul), and so every year his death was mourned. But it wasn’t just Tamuz; they also believed that people went on to exist in another form after death, which led the Babylonians to worship the dead. This teaching, that people continue to live or be conscious after death, has survived and been adopted by spiritual Babylon, and her influence has made it spread to many Christian churches even though the Bible preaches the exact opposite (Ecclesiastes 9:5; Psalm 115:17). What else did ancient Babylon believe? “Therefore, behold, the days come, that I will do judgment upon the graven images of Babylon: and her whole land shall be confounded, and all her slain shall fall in the midst of her.” —Jeremiah 51:47 “And he brought me into the inner court of the LORD’S house, and, behold, at the door of the temple of the LORD, between the porch and the altar, were about five and twenty men, with their backs toward the temple of the LORD, and their faces toward the east; and they worshipped the sun toward the east.” —Ezekiel 8:16 The worship of graven images was also a practice of ancient Babylonians that has been adopted by spiritual Babylon even though God clearly forbids it in the second commandment (Exodus 20:4-6). Ancient Babylonians practiced sun worship too, and it managed to corrupt some of God’s very own people. The practice has been adopted by spiritual Babylon through the keeping of Sunday—the day of the sun—as the day of worship instead of the seventh-day Sabbath as outlined in the fourth commandment (Exodus 20:8-11). Many are unaware of the pagan origin of Sunday-keeping, which is why God has a message for the last days calling people to worship Him according to His commandments. Incidentally, the false teaching that the law of God has been changed or repealed is also propogated by spiritual Babylon even though the Bible clearly teaches the law cannot be changed (Luke 16:17). One other particularly destructive pagan teaching that has caused many people to turn away from God is the belief that sinners burn eternally in hell—an echo of Satan’s original “you shall not surely die” lie in Eden and a contradiction of God’s Word (Genesis 2:17; 3:4). What is God’s message to people in Babylon? “Flee out of the midst of Babylon, and deliver every man his soul: be not cut off in her iniquity; for this is the time of the LORD’S vengeance; he will render unto her a recompence.” —Jeremiah 51:6 “And after these things I saw another angel come down from heaven, having great power; and the earth was lightened with his glory. And he cried mightily with a strong voice, saying, Babylon the great is fallen, is fallen, and is become the habitation of devils, and the hold of every foul spirit, and a cage of every unclean and hateful bird. For all nations have drunk of the wine of the wrath of her fornication, and the kings of the earth have committed fornication with her, and the merchants of the earth are waxed rich through the abundance of her delicacies. And I heard another voice from heaven, saying, Come out of her, my people, that ye be not partakers of her sins, and that ye receive not of her plagues. For her sins have reached unto heaven, and God hath remembered her iniquities.” —Revelation 18:1-5 “And other sheep I have, which are not of this fold: them also I must bring, and they shall hear my voice; and there shall be one fold, and one shepherd.” —John 10:16 The false teachings previously mentioned are some of the key doctrines, the wine, through which spiritual Babylon makes all nations of the world drunk (Revelation 17:2; 18:3). This wine disorients, confuses, and leads to spiritual drunkenness. And it’s based on lies, which are a type of abomination in the Bible (Proverbs 12:22). Just like God called Israel out of ancient Babylon, He is calling His people out of spiritual Babylon before it’s destroyed because He knows He has sincere Christians there who have not heard this warning yet. When they hear His call, Jesus says they will heed His voice and follow Him. How did Jesus unmask Satan’s lies in the wilderness? “But he answered and said, It is written, Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God. … Jesus said unto him, It is written again, Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God. … Then saith Jesus unto him, Get thee hence, Satan: for it is written, Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and him only shalt thou serve.” —Matthew 4:4, 7, 10 “To the law and to the testimony: if they speak not according to this word, it is because there is no light in them.” —Isaiah 8:20 Jesus’ answer to every deception Satan threw at Him was to quote the Bible. (Note that Satan quoted the Bible too, but he twisted it for his own purposes.) Studying and memorizing Scripture is the only effective strategy to resist Satan’s deceptions in these last days, because he will twist the Bible again. After all, his persuasive logic managed to deceieve a third of the angels in heaven (Revelation 12:4) and almost the entire population (minus eight people) at the time of the Flood. How will God unmask Satan’s deceptions in the last days? “And after these things I saw another angel come down from heaven, having great power; and the earth was lightened with his glory.” —Revelation 18:1 “And this gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a witness unto all nations; and then shall the end come.” —Matthew 24:14 In the Bible, angels symbolize messengers or messages. Because God wants everyone to come to the knowledge of the truth so that they can be saved (1 Timothy 2:3-4), He will have a remnant people, portrayed in the three angels’ messages of Revelation 14:6-14, who will stand for Bible truth and expose the false gospel of Babylon (Galatians 1:8-12), calling people to worship and obey Him, not only in spirit but also in truth. God’s message of truth will be so powerful that it will illuminate the whole world with His glory, so that every person, instead of being deceived, will be well-informed when making a decision regarding who to worship. Am I lost if I’m currently in Babylon? “And the times of this ignorance God winked at; but now commandeth all men every where to repent.” —Acts 17:30 Absolutely not. This is made clear in God’s call to “Come out of her, my people,” meaning there are sincere people in Babylon whom God calls His children. Not knowing certain Bible teachings does not mean a person is lost or not a child of God as He does not hold me accountable for truths I don’t know, but once I know the truth, God calls me out of error to stand on the Bible alone. Can I stay in Babylon in order to reform her? “And I heard another voice from heaven, saying, Come out of her, my people, that ye be not partakers of her sins, and that ye receive not of her plagues. … Therefore shall her plagues come in one day, death, and mourning, and famine; and she shall be utterly burned with fire: for strong is the Lord God who judgeth her.” —Revelation 18:4, 8 “Whosoever committeth sin transgresseth also the law: for sin is the transgression of the law.” —1 John 3:4 Babylon has become hopelessly drunk with her false doctrines and traditions, which have resulted in her sinning against God (breaking His law), and Jesus says she’s going to be destroyed, not reformed. There may be pressure from other people to stay in Babylon, but remaining in a system that teaches errors is spiritually dangerous; ultimately, it’s Jesus’ opinion that matters most. When Paul was under immense pressure from religious leaders to compromise with error, He answered, “We ought to obey God rather than men” (Acts 5:29). Though it may seem difficult, it’s the right thing to do. If this is you, ask God for guidance as you seek His will and search the Scriptures (Acts 17:11). Promise Him that you will follow wherever He leads, and His promise to you is He will lead you to the truth (John 7:17), which will set you free (John 17:17). When Jesus has your heart, He will give all the grace you need to follow Him (Philippians 4:13).\",\"series\":\"Coming Out of Babylon\"},\"27\":{\"title\":\"How to Identify a Cult?\",\"url\":\"/prophecy/cult/\",\"category\":\"Prophecy\",\"description\":\"Is it possible to be part of a cult and not know it? Discover it’s identifying marks to avoid being fooled.\",\"body\":\"Who is the source of truth? “Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.” —John 14:6 “Sanctify them through thy truth: thy word is truth.” —John 17:17 “And ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free.” —John 8:32 “Through thy precepts I get understanding: therefore I hate every false way. Thy word is a lamp unto my feet, and a light unto my path.” —Psalm 119:104-105 Jesus is truth, and His Word to us, the Bible, is truth. It’s the Light that illuminates the path of life, that exposes the various lies of the world, and any message that is contrary to it is not from God. The truth of Jesus has the power to sanctify and set me free from deception and sin, but this also means that lies have the power to corrupt and bring me into bondage. What warning did Jesus give about rejecting truth? “And with all deceivableness of unrighteousness in them that perish; because they received not the love of the truth, that they might be saved. And for this cause God shall send them strong delusion, that they should believe a lie, that they all might be damned who believed not the truth, but had pleasure in unrighteousness.” —2 Thessalonians 2:10-12 The rejection of truth opens oneself up to deception, delusion, and the accepting of lies. Does God have a people who believe the truth? “But if I tarry long, that thou mayest know how thou oughtest to behave thyself in the house of God, which is the church of the living God, the pillar and ground of the truth.” —1 Timothy 3:15 Jesus began His work with His disciples; they were the beginning of His church. After He ascended to heaven, His disciples went about preaching the good news of the gospel with power, expanding His church in all directions. Ever since, Jesus has always had a people, His church, who have believed the truth as it was taught by Him. What is the history of God’s church? “And I saw when the Lamb opened one of the seals, and I heard, as it were the noise of thunder, one of the four beasts saying, Come and see. And I saw, and behold a white horse: and he that sat on him had a bow; and a crown was given unto him: and he went forth conquering, and to conquer. And when he had opened the second seal, I heard the second beast say, Come and see. And there went out another horse that was red: and power was given to him that sat thereon to take peace from the earth, and that they should kill one another: and there was given unto him a great sword. ““And when he had opened the third seal, I heard the third beast say, Come and see. And I beheld, and lo a black horse; and he that sat on him had a pair of balances in his hand. And I heard a voice in the midst of the four beasts say, A measure of wheat for a penny, and three measures of barley for a penny; and see thou hurt not the oil and the wine. And when he had opened the fourth seal, I heard the voice of the fourth beast say, Come and see. And I looked, and behold a pale horse: and his name that sat on him was Death, and Hell followed with him. And power was given unto them over the fourth part of the earth, to kill with sword, and with hunger, and with death, and with the beasts of the earth.” —Revelation 6:1-8 Revelation 6 outlines the history of God’s church with four symbolic horses. In Zechariah 6:1-8 there is a similar vision with four chariots of two horses, and when Zechariah asks the angel what they represent he is told they are essentially messengers that go out. The number four, on the other hand, represents the four corners of the earth (Revelation 7:1; Matthew 24:31), so the four horses in Revelation 6 refer to the spread of the church, and more specifically, the phases that God’s church goes through as it spreads Jesus’ gospel message to the whole world. - White horse: The church began with the white horse, which is a symbol of purity (Psalm 51:7; Isaiah 1:18). This period began with the ascension of Jesus in A.D. 31 and lasted until the death of the last apostle in A.D. 100. The conquering of this horse refers to spiritual conquest, conquering falsehood with the arrows of truth (symbolized by the rider’s bow), and this the church did very well because after the Holy Spirit was poured out during Pentecost (Acts 2:1-4), the gospel message went out to the entire then-known world (Colossians 1:23). - Red horse: The second horse is red, a symbol of blood (2 Kings 3:22), and in this context it represents persecution, which lasted from A.D. 100 to A.D. 313. The success of the apostolic church did not go unnoticed, so Satan used the Roman Empire to start persecuting God’s people (symbolized by the rider’s great sword); nevertheless, the church continued to grow during this time (Romans 8:35-39). - Black horse: The third horse is black, and since it’s the opposite of white (purity), it represents corruption. This period lasted from A.D. 313 to A.D. 538. It was a time when Christianity was accepted by the state, which led to the introduction of various false, pagan doctrines and practices that ended up corrupting the church. The pair of scales in the rider’s hand represent judgment (Daniel 5:24-28). - Pale horse: The fourth and final horse is pale (near death), and the rider is called Death. This can only point to the period of the Dark Ages when Satan tried to extinguish the truths taught by Jesus and recorded in His Word (Acts 20:28-30; 2 Thessalonians 2:1-10). This phase spans from A.D. 538 to 1517—the start of the Reformation. What else does the Bible say about this last period? “And an host was given him against the daily sacrifice by reason of transgression, and it cast down the truth to the ground; and it practised, and prospered.” —Daniel 8:12 “Let no man deceive you by any means: for that day shall not come, except there come a falling away first, and that man of sin be revealed, the son of perdition; who opposeth and exalteth himself above all that is called God, or that is worshipped; so that he as God sitteth in the temple of God, shewing himself that he is God.” —2 Thessalonians 2:3-7 “Beloved, when I gave all diligence to write unto you of the common salvation, it was needful for me to write unto you, and exhort you that ye should earnestly contend for the faith which was once delivered unto the saints. For there are certain men crept in unawares, who were before of old ordained to this condemnation, ungodly men, turning the grace of our God into lasciviousness, and denying the only Lord God, and our Lord Jesus Christ.” —Jude 1:3-4 Daniel predicted a time when truth would be cast down, and Paul wrote about a falling away that would occur before the second coming of Christ, marked by a religious system rising up that would oppose and exalt itself above God Himself. This was also echoed by Jude, who encouraged his readers to contend earnestly for the unadulterated faith of the apostolic church. God used the Reformation movement to restore a lot of the truths that were cast to the ground, but this warfare against biblical truth has not ceased. The words of Paul and Jude are as relevant today as they were during the Dark Ages. What did Jesus warn about in the last days? “For there shall arise false Christs, and false prophets, and shall shew great signs and wonders<; insomuch that, if it were possible, they shall deceive the very elect.” —Matthew 24:24 “Put not your trust in princes, nor in the son of man, in whom there is no help.” —Psalm 146:3 “Look unto me, and be ye saved, all the ends of the earth: for I am God, and there is none else.” —Isaiah 45:22 Jesus warned about false prophets arising in the last days whose aim would be to deceive people, which brings us to the first identifying characteristic of a cult: it has one powerful human leader. This is dangerous because Jesus never taught His disciples to establish a hierarchy; on the contrary, He taught about humility and self-sacrifice in service to others (Matthew 20:25-28), and so the apostles saw themselves as fellow workers with others (Philemon 1:24). The Bible is very clear that we are not to put our trust in fallible human leaders, but to look to God, who alone can save us. What is another identifying mark of a cult? “Howbeit in vain do they worship me, teaching for doctrines the commandments of men.” —Mark 7:7 The second characteristic of a cult is the leader’s teachings cannot be questioned; they essentially become absolute truth even if they go against the teachings of the Bible, thus elevating them, and their leader, above the Bible. Jesus knew this would happen and clearly warned against it. What is the third identifier? “For do I now persuade men, or God? or do I seek to please men? for if I yet pleased men, I should not be the servant of Christ.” —Galatians 1:10 “You shall not follow the crowd in doing evil, nor shall you testify in a dispute so as to join together with a crowd in order to pervert justice.” —Exodus 23:2, NASB Cults will often pressure their members in order to coerce them into submission. This was the tactic the religious leaders used to coerce Pilate to crucify our Lord (Matthew 27:24) even though he was convinced Jesus was innocent. When there is a conflict between the demands of human beings and the will of Jesus as revealed in His Word, loyalty to Christ always takes precedence. What is the fourth identifying mark? “Beloved, when I gave all diligence to write unto you of the common salvation, it was needful for me to write unto you, and exhort you that ye should earnestly contend for the faith which was once delivered unto the saints. For there are certain men crept in unawares, who were before of old ordained to this condemnation, ungodly men, turning the grace of our God into lasciviousness, and denying the only Lord God, and our Lord Jesus Christ.” —Colossians 2:8-9 “Beware lest any man spoil you through philosophy and vain deceit, after the tradition of men, after the rudiments of the world, and not after Christ. For in him dwelleth all the fulness of the Godhead bodily.” —Colossians 2:8-9 The fourth identifier of cults is their denial that Jesus is the divine Son of God—a central truth of the plan of salvation. The Bible plainly teaches that salvation is a gift from God (Ephesians 2:8) since God the Father gave His Son (John 3:16), and God the Son gave Himself, of His own free will (John 10:17-18), on the cross for humanity. Incidentally, this denial of Christ’s divinity is almost a necessity as it opens the way for a human being to become the cult’s Messiah-like leader. What is the final identifier? “And the woman which hath an husband that believeth not, and if he be pleased to dwell with her, let her not leave him. For the unbelieving husband is sanctified by the wife, and the unbelieving wife is sanctified by the husband: else were your children unclean; but now are they holy.” —1 Corinthians 7:13-14 Cults will often pressure their followers to leave their families because such separation makes it possible to have more control over their followers. The Bible does not teach this. Paul says that, if possible, a believing wife should not separate from an unbelieving husband. Jesus, too, after healing the demoniac, told him to go home to his friends to share what He had done for him even though the man wanted to follow Jesus (Mark 5:18-20). Instead of leaving his family and friends, Jesus wanted him to first reach them with the good news of the gospel! What counsel did Jesus give about the light of His truth? “Then Jesus said unto them, Yet a little while is the light with you. Walk while ye have the light, lest darkness come upon you: for he that walketh in darkness knoweth not whither he goeth. While ye have light, believe in the light, that ye may be the children of light.” —John 12:35-36 “To the law and to the testimony: if they speak not according to this word, it is because there is no light in them.” —Isaiah 8:20 The Bible is the great Light (Psalm 119:105), which we have the privilege of following while walking through life, and those who do this become the children of light. The Light prevents us from being deceived by lies that can only lead to darkness and bondage. Isaiah invites us to test every teaching with God’s Word. Is it in harmony with the Bible? If not, it is not from God. Will there be people loyal to God in the last days? “And the dragon was wroth with the woman, and went to make war with the remnant of her seed, which keep the commandments of God, and have the testimony of Jesus Christ.” —Revelation 12:17 “Here is the patience of the saints: here are they that keep the commandments of God, and the faith of Jesus.” —Revelation 14:12 God has always had a people who cling to biblical truth, refusing to compromise with man-made traditions, and this will be the case in the last days too, when God will have loyal followers who keep the faith and the testimony of Jesus, including His Ten Commandments. Will the truth ever be conquered by darkness? “And this gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a witness unto all nations; and then shall the end come.” —Matthew 24:14 “And I saw another angel fly in the midst of heaven, having the everlasting gospel to preach unto them that dwell on the earth, and to every nation, and kindred, and tongue, and people, saying with a loud voice, Fear God, and give glory to him; for the hour of his judgment is come: and worship him that made heaven, and earth, and the sea, and the fountains of waters.” —Revelation 14:6-7 God still had a people during the Dark Ages, like the Waldenses, Albigenses, and Huguenots, who faithfully preserved and followed the truth of His Word, which earned them only a life of relentless persecution, but this did not move them (Acts 20:23-24) because they counted the truth of God’s Word more precious than life itself. When the Reformation began, the truth was unshackled and made even more accessible to the masses. Now with modern technologies like the radio, television, and the internet, the gospel is being, and will continue to be, preached all over the world until everyone has heard the good news of Jesus Christ’s love!\",\"series\":\"Coming Out of Babylon\"},\"28\":{\"title\":\"Europe’s Future Revealed\",\"url\":\"/prophecy/europe/\",\"category\":\"Prophecy\",\"description\":\"Delve into a remarkable prophecy about the rise and fall of kingdoms. What does the future hold for Europe?\",\"body\":\"How does the story start? “And in the second year of the reign of Nebuchadnezzar Nebuchadnezzar dreamed dreams, wherewith his spirit was troubled, and his sleep brake from him. Then the king commanded to call the magicians, and the astrologers, and the sorcerers, and the Chaldeans, for to shew the king his dreams. So they came and stood before the king. And the king said unto them, I have dreamed a dream, and my spirit was troubled to know the dream. Then spake the Chaldeans to the king in Syriack, O king, live for ever: tell thy servants the dream, and we will shew the interpretation. ““The king answered and said to the Chaldeans, The thing is gone from me: if ye will not make known unto me the dream, with the interpretation thereof, ye shall be cut in pieces, and your houses shall be made a dunghill. But if ye shew the dream, and the interpretation thereof, ye shall receive of me gifts and rewards and great honour: therefore shew me the dream, and the interpretation thereof. They answered again and said, Let the king tell his servants the dream, and we will shew the interpretation of it. ““The king answered and said, I know of certainty that ye would gain the time, because ye see the thing is gone from me. But if ye will not make known unto me the dream, there is but one decree for you: for ye have prepared lying and corrupt words to speak before me, till the time be changed: therefore tell me the dream, and I shall know that ye can shew me the interpretation thereof. ““The Chaldeans answered before the king, and said, There is not a man upon the earth that can shew the king’s matter: therefore there is no king, lord, nor ruler, that asked such things at any magician, or astrologer, or Chaldean. And it is a rare thing that the king requireth, and there is none other that can shew it before the king, except the gods, whose dwelling is not with flesh. ““For this cause the king was angry and very furious, and commanded to destroy all the wise men of Babylon.” —Daniel 2:1-13 Who then appeared before the king? “And the decree went forth that the wise men should be slain; and they sought Daniel and his fellows to be slain. … Then Daniel went in, and desired of the king that he would give him time, and that he would shew the king the interpretation.” —Daniel 2:13, 16 Daniel and his friends were also under the death sentence that the king had pronounced on the wise men, so when he heard about it, he quickly went to the king to ask for more time. What did Daniel do next? “Then Daniel went to his house, and made the thing known to Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah, his companions: that they would desire mercies of the God of heaven concerning this secret; that Daniel and his fellows should not perish with the rest of the wise men of Babylon. Then was the secret revealed unto Daniel in a night vision.” —Daniel 2:17-19 Daniel asked his friends to join him in prayer, seeking God to reveal the dream, and their request was granted when God revealed it to Daniel. This underscores the important role that prayer plays in the life of a Christian. Who did Daniel give credit to? “Daniel answered and said, Blessed be the name of God for ever and ever: for wisdom and might are his: and he changeth the times and the seasons: he removeth kings, and setteth up kings: he giveth wisdom unto the wise, and knowledge to them that know understanding: He revealeth the deep and secret things: he knoweth what is in the darkness, and the light dwelleth with him. I thank thee, and praise thee, O thou God of my fathers, who hast given me wisdom and might, and hast made known unto me now what we desired of thee: for thou hast now made known unto us the king’s matter.” —Daniel 2:20-23 God saved their lives by revealing the king’s dream and its interpretation, and Daniel gave God all the credit. What was the dream’s purpose? “But there is a God in heaven that revealeth secrets, and maketh known to the king Nebuchadnezzar what shall be in the latter days.” —Daniel 2:28 “As for thee, O king, thy thoughts came into thy mind upon thy bed, what should come to pass hereafter: and he that revealeth secrets maketh known to thee what shall come to pass. But as for me, this secret is not revealed to me for any wisdom that I have more than any living, but for their sakes that shall make known the interpretation to the king, and that thou mightest know the thoughts of thy heart.” —Daniel 2:29-30 The dream was God’s answer to the king’s wondering about what the future would hold for his kingdom. What did the king see? “Thou, O king, sawest, and behold a great image. This great image, whose brightness was excellent, stood before thee; and the form thereof was terrible. This image’s head was of fine gold, his breast and his arms of silver, his belly and his thighs of brass, his legs of iron, his feet part of iron and part of clay.” —Daniel 2:31-33 What happened to it? “Thou sawest till that a stone was cut out without hands, which smote the image upon his feet that were of iron and clay, and brake them to pieces. Then was the iron, the clay, the brass, the silver, and the gold, broken to pieces together, and became like the chaff of the summer threshing floors; and the wind carried them away, that no place was found for them: and the stone that smote the image became a great mountain, and filled the whole earth.” —Daniel 2:34-35 Who did the head of gold represent? “This is the dream; and we will tell the interpretation thereof before the king. Thou, O king, art a king of kings: for the God of heaven hath given thee a kingdom, power, and strength, and glory. And wheresoever the children of men dwell, the beasts of the field and the fowls of the heaven hath he given into thine hand, and hath made thee ruler over them all. Thou art this head of gold.” —Daniel 2:36-38 Aptly symbolized by a head of gold, Babylon was one of the most extravagant kingdoms of antiquity. It ruled supreme from 612 BC onward, after conquering the Assyrian capital of Nineveh. The city’s walls were nearly 200 feet high and wide enough for two chariots to ride side by side, while the Hanging Gardens were one of the Seven Wonders of the World. Would his kingdom last? “And after thee shall arise another kingdom inferior to thee, and another third kingdom of brass, which shall bear rule over all the earth.” —Daniel 2:39 Who did the chest of silver represent? “PERES: Thy kingdom is divided, and given to the Medes and Persians.” —Daniel 5:28 “In that night was Belshazzar the king of the Chaldeans slain. And Darius the Median took the kingdom, being about threescore and two years old.” —Daniel 5:30-31 Babylon was conquered by Cyrus in 539 BC, making the Medo-Persian Empire the next dominant power. Under its reign, all taxes were required to be paid in silver. Did the Bible predict Babylon’s fall? “That saith to the deep, Be dry, and I will dry up thy rivers: that saith of Cyrus, He is my shepherd, and shall perform all my pleasure: even saying to Jerusalem, Thou shalt be built; and to the temple, Thy foundation shall be laid.” —Isaiah 44:27-28 “Thus saith the LORD to his anointed, to Cyrus, whose right hand I have holden, to subdue nations before him; and I will loose the loins of kings, to open before him the two leaved gates; and the gates shall not be shut.” —Isaiah 45:1 In one of the most astoundingly detailed prophecies, God not only explicitly named Cyrus through His prophet Isaiah but also predicted the manner in which he would conquer Babylon—more than 150 years before it happened! According to the ancient historian Herodotus, when Cyrus surrounded Babylon, his armies diverted the Euphrates River that flowed through the city, allowing them to pass under the city’s walls by walking on the riverbed. Babylon also had street gates that controlled access to the river, but that night, the gates were left open! What would come next? “And after thee shall arise another kingdom inferior to thee, and another third kingdom of brass, which shall bear rule over all the earth.” —Daniel 2:39 After the silver kingdom symbolizing Medo-Persia, a third kingdom—represented by bronze—would arise. Notably, each succeeding metal in the statue is less valuable but more enduring than the one before it. What kingdom was this? “The ram which thou sawest having two horns are the kings of Media and Persia. And the rough goat is the king of Grecia: and the great horn that is between his eyes is the first king.” —Daniel 8:20-21 Daniel 8 is a parallel prophecy that repeats and expands on the one in Daniel 2, and it identifies Greece as the empire that would succeed Medo-Persia. After a series of campaigns, Alexander the Great delivered a decisive blow to the Persian Empire at the Battle of Arbela in 331 BC, making the kingdom of Greece the next dominant world power. Notably, the armor of Greek soldiers was made entirely of bronze. What is the fourth kingdom like? “And the fourth kingdom shall be strong as iron: forasmuch as iron breaketh in pieces and subdueth all things: and as iron that breaketh all these, shall it break in pieces and bruise.” —Daniel 2:40 The iron monarchy of Rome conquered the Greeks in 168 BC and was the world power when Jesus was born. The legs of iron are a fitting symbol, as Rome’s long reign—lasting over 600 years—brought great persecution to God’s people. What do the iron and clay feet represent? “And whereas thou sawest the feet and toes, part of potters’ clay, and part of iron, the kingdom shall be divided; but there shall be in it of the strength of the iron, forasmuch as thou sawest the iron mixed with miry clay. And as the toes of the feet were part of iron, and part of clay, so the kingdom shall be partly strong, and partly broken.” —Daniel 2:41-42 “O house of Israel, cannot I do with you as this potter? saith the LORD. Behold, as the clay is in the potter’s hand, so are ye in mine hand, O house of Israel.” —Jeremiah 18:6 Unlike the head, chest, thighs, and legs—each made of a single metal—the feet and toes are composed of a mixture of iron and clay. This indicates that the kingdom they represent will be fundamentally different from the ones before it. The iron is described as strong, while the clay—the only non-metal element in the statue—is called “broken” (fragile). Because clay is not a metal, it cannot represent a civil power like the metals that came before it. Jeremiah 18:6 tells us that clay represents God’s people—His church—because of its apparent fragility, especially when contrasted with the strength of civil power, which holds the authority to enforce law and order. When the Christian church started apostatizing, it sought to regain the power of the apostolic church by uniting with civil government to enforce its laws against heretics. The Edict of Milan in AD 313 opened the door for the union of church and state that, in God’s eyes, cannot be legitimately joined (Daniel 2:43). Because this union is unlawful, it will disintegrate at Christ’s second coming, symbolized by the stone cut without hands that crushes the image to powder (Daniel 2:34). The only legitimate union of God’s church is with Jesus Christ, who is described as her Husband (Ephesians 5:25) and the Rock upon which she is built (Ephesians 2:19-22; Matthew 7:24-25). With such a sure Foundation, she has no need for protection or support from civil power to ensure her survival. The mingling of church and state that began in the Roman Empire in AD 313 brought ruin upon the empire in the following century through the invasions of barbarian tribes. This church-state union was then reestablished under the papacy’s ecclesiastical empire in Europe, which lasted from AD 538 until 1798, when Napoleon Bonaparte’s general took Pope Pius VI captive. Although God’s judgment took longer to manifest than it did in the Roman Empire, it still came. A third and final installment of this union will occur just prior to Christ’s Second Coming—this time in the United States—and will then be imitated by the rest of the world. National and global ruin will once again be the inevitable result (Daniel 2:34). What else is significant about the feet? The iron-clay mixture in the feet forms the foundation upon which the entire image stands. This suggests that the union of apostate Christianity with civil power is the culmination toward which history has been trending. Under the Babylonian, Medo-Persian, Grecian, and Roman empires, religion was deeply intertwined with the state, so much so that it became a civic duty rather than merely a personal matter. What is notable about the iron-clay mixture in the feet is that it represents a power claiming to be God’s church—one that ought to know better, especially since Jesus Himself said that His kingdom is not of this world (John 18:36), and that a clear separation between one’s duties to God and to the state must always be maintained (Luke 20:25). In the pagan empires of Babylon, Persia, Greece, and Rome, the state was supreme over religion, using religion to support its authority. However, under the papal government symbolized by the feet, this pattern was reversed: religion was elevated above the state, using the state for its support. Thus, the mingling of religion and government in the pagan empires served as a precursor to the ultimate form of this union under the papacy. Although Constantine began blending church and state in AD 313 with the Edict of Milan, the church did not gain total supremacy over the state until AD 538, when the last barbarian tribe opposing the papacy—the Ostrogoths—was overthrown. With this achieved, Justinian’s decree of 533 AD, which elevated the pope to headship over all churches and appointed him the corrector of all heresies, could be fully enforced. It is remarkable that, instead of clean break between the metals, the iron found in the legs continues into the feet and toes, extending all the way to the end of time. When the Roman Empire crumbled, a new power rose in its place, led by the pope, who claimed the title Pontifex Maximus adopted by the Caesars. Consequently, the Roman element, symbolized by iron, shifted from the civil authority of the Roman Empire to that of the Roman Catholic Church, which claimed this right, in part, based on the forged Donation of Constantine. Pagan Rome had become papal Rome. Under this new arrangement, the pope not only assumed the imperial title of the Caesars but also claimed the religious title Vicar of Christ, asserting himself as the successor of Peter and the head of all churches. Thus, the Roman Catholic Church is a union of church and state, symbolized by the iron and clay, with the state subservient to the church—a complete reversal of the pattern seen in the previous empires. The United States was the first nation to break this trend because of its Constitution; however, even this would prove to be only temporary, as prophecy predicts a future union of church and state in the United States prior to the Second Coming of Christ. This will not be the first occurrence either, as the Supreme Court’s landmark 1892 decision in Church of the Holy Trinity v. United States declared the United States a Christian nation. Moreover, that same year, Congress passed legislation to close the World’s Columbian Exposition on Sundays in honor of Sunday observance, which was also approved by President Benjamin Harrison. As a result, only 101 years after the ratification of the First Amendment, which established the separation of church and state, all three branches of the United States government had repudiated it. Why must this separation be maintained? Because the state has no right to dictate anything in the realm of worship, which belongs exclusively to God and in which the individual’s right of conscience reigns supreme. This principle was understood early on—more than a millennium before it was enshrined in the U.S. Constitution—as seen in the following excerpt from a letter sent in AD 524 by Theodoric the Great, king of Italy, to the Byzantine emperor Justin I: “To pretend to a dominion over the conscience, is to usurp the prerogative of God. By the nature of things, the power of sovereigns is confined to political government. They have no right of punishment but over those who disturb the public peace. The most dangerous heresy is that of a sovereign who separates himself from part of his subjects, because they believe not according to his belief.” —Quoted in A. T. Jones, The Two Republics, 537 (1891). The Edict of Milan ordered that church property confiscated under the edicts of Diocletian be restored to Christians, which sparked controversy over which groups of believers qualified as Christians. A year after the Edict of Milan, Constantine convened the Council of Arles to address the issue, and the council affirmed the Catholic Church as the representative of orthodox Christianity. What is represented by the toes? “And the ten horns out of this kingdom are ten kings that shall arise: and another shall rise after them; and he shall be diverse from the first, and he shall subdue three kings.” —Daniel 7:24 The prophecy of Daniel 2 is expanded in Daniel 7: just as the image in Daniel 2 has ten toes, so the fourth beast in Daniel 7 has ten horns. Eighteen distinct tribes played a role in the destruction of the Western Roman Empire, but exactly ten—no more, no less—remained when the Empire finally collapsed in AD 476, just as the Bible had predicted by the ten toes. Three of the ten were destroyed, but the seven remaining would give rise to the modern nations of Europe: Visigoths (Spain), Franks (France), Alemanni (Germany), Suevi (Portugal), Anglo-Saxons (England), Burgundians (Switzerland), Lombards (Italy), Heruli (destroyed in 493 AD), Vandals (destroyed in 534 AD), and Ostrogoths (destroyed in 538 AD). The eighteen tribes were the Alemanni, Alans, Angles, Burgundians, Franks, Gepids, Heruli, Huns, Jutes, Lombards, Ostrogoths, Rugians, Saxons, Sciri, Suevi, Thuringians, Vandals, and Visigoths. Will national divisions be abolished? Since the toes are the final portion of the image, the national divisions they symbolize will remain until the second coming of Christ, despite numerous attempts throughout history to abolish them. Leaders such as Charlemagne, Napoleon, Kaiser Wilhelm II, and Hitler all tried and failed to restore a fully unified empire. Even modern efforts, like the European Union, will not succeed. No power will ever rise again to unite all nations under a single empire, as Babylon, Medo-Persia, Greece, and Rome once did. Revelation predicts that just before Christ’s return, all the nations of the world will unite to destroy God’s people, but God will intervene before their plans are carried out. What happens next? “And in the days of these kings shall the God of heaven set up a kingdom, which shall never be destroyed: and the kingdom shall not be left to other people, but it shall break in pieces and consume all these kingdoms, and it shall stand for ever. Forasmuch as thou sawest that the stone was cut out of the mountain without hands, and that it brake in pieces the iron, the brass, the clay, the silver, and the gold; the great God hath made known to the king what shall come to pass hereafter: and the dream is certain, and the interpretation thereof sure.” —Daniel 2:44-45 The stone cut without hands represents Christ’s eternal kingdom, which will replace all earthly kingdoms at His return. Some have misapplied the symbolism of the stone to represent an earthly millennial kingdom established by His Church, but this cannot be the case, as the Bible teaches that the earth will be completely destroyed at His Second Coming and that the saved will be caught up to heaven. The stone, by the way, strikes the image at its feet, which indicates that Jesus will return during the time of the divided nations. Any other Bible references to Christ’s kingdom? “Ask of Me, and I will give You the nations for Your inheritance, and the ends of the earth for Your possession. You shall break them with a rod of iron; You shall dash them to pieces like a potter’s vessel.” —Psalm 2:8-9, NKJV “Jesus saith unto them, Did ye never read in the scriptures, The stone which the builders rejected, the same is become the head of the corner: this is the Lord’s doing, and it is marvellous in our eyes? Therefore say I unto you, The kingdom of God shall be taken from you, and given to a nation bringing forth the fruits thereof. And whosoever shall fall on this stone shall be broken: but on whomsoever it shall fall, it will grind him to powder.” —Matthew 21:42-44 In Psalm 2, David, under divine inspiration, foreshadowed the prophecy of Daniel 2:34—centuries before it was revealed. Jesus also compared Himself to the Stone that would grind to powder those upon whom it falls—a reference to those who reject His mercy. In contrast, those who fall on the Stone of their own accord will be broken; that is, when they encounter the reality of His love, they are humbled and choose to surrender their pride and self-righteousness to Him (Matthew 5:5). What hope does the Bible give? “For the grace of God that bringeth salvation hath appeared to all men, teaching us that, denying ungodliness and worldly lusts, we should live soberly, righteously, and godly, in this present world; looking for that blessed hope, and the glorious appearing of the great God and our Saviour Jesus Christ.” —Titus 2:11-13 “Nevertheless we, according to his promise, look for new heavens and a new earth, wherein dwelleth righteousness.” —2 Peter 3:13 “And I saw a new heaven and a new earth: for the first heaven and the first earth were passed away; and there was no more sea. And I John saw the holy city, new Jerusalem, coming down from God out of heaven, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband. And I heard a great voice out of heaven saying, Behold, the tabernacle of God is with men, and he will dwell with them, and they shall be his people, and God himself shall be with them, and be their God. And God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes; and there shall be no more death, neither sorrow, nor crying, neither shall there be any more pain: for the former things are passed away.” —Revelation 21:1-4 Daniel 2 teaches that God knows the end from the beginning and is Sovereign over all of history (Isaiah 46:9-10; Proverbs 21:1; Daniel 2:21). He has granted every empire ample time and opportunity to come to know Him, but when His mercies are resisted and His truth rejected, the guilty empire falls, and another rises in its place ( Acts 17:26-27). This pattern is evident in the rise and fall of Babylon, Medo-Persia, Greece, and Rome, and it will continue until history reaches its climactic point: the return of Christ in the clouds to establish His eternal kingdom, free from sin and all the sorrow it brings. The Bible assures us that this present world of pain, suffering, and evil will not endure forever. Soon, it will be replaced by Christ’s glorious new kingdom, where righteousness dwells.\"},\"29\":{\"title\":\"The 2,300 Day Prophecy\",\"url\":\"/prophecy/investigative/\",\"category\":\"Prophecy\",\"description\":\"A prophecy that stretches into the 19th century with implications for people living today. Are you aware of it?\",\"body\":\"What does Daniel see in chapter eight? “Then I lifted up mine eyes, and saw, and, behold, there stood before the river a ram which had two horns: and the two horns were high; but one was higher than the other, and the higher came up last. I saw the ram pushing westward, and northward, and southward; so that no beasts might stand before him, neither was there any that could deliver out of his hand; but he did according to his will, and became great.” —Daniel 8:3-4 “The ram which thou sawest having two horns are the kings of Media and Persia.” —Daniel 8:20 Daniel sees a two-horned lamb, which we later learn represents the kingdom of Medo-Persia. This same kingdom was represented by a bear in Daniel 7:5 since the Bible operates on the principle of “repeat and expand” where the prophecy is repeated and more detail is added. What does he see next? “And as I was considering, behold, an he goat came from the west on the face of the whole earth, and touched not the ground: and the goat had a notable horn between his eyes. And he came to the ram that had two horns, which I had seen standing before the river, and ran unto him in the fury of his power. And I saw him come close unto the ram, and he was moved with choler against him, and smote the ram, and brake his two horns: and there was no power in the ram to stand before him, but he cast him down to the ground, and stamped upon him: and there was none that could deliver the ram out of his hand. Therefore the he goat waxed very great: and when he was strong, the great horn was broken; and for it came up four notable ones toward the four winds of heaven.” —Daniel 8:5-8 “And the rough goat is the king of Grecia: and the great horn that is between his eyes is the first king. Now that being broken, whereas four stood up for it, four kingdoms shall stand up out of the nation, but not in his power.” —Daniel 8:21-22 Daniel then sees a goat with a large horn moving so swiftly that its feet never touch the ground. The goat attacks the ram, conquers it, and the goat’s horn is then broken off and replaced with four other horns. We later learn this goat represents the kingdom of Greece. The great horn is none other than Alexander the Great, while the four horns it’s replaced by represent the four kingdoms into which his empire was divided. In Daniel 7:6 this same kingdom is represented by a leopard with four heads. What does Daniel see next? “And out of one of them came forth a little horn, which waxed exceeding great, toward the south, and toward the east, and toward the pleasant land. And it waxed great, even to the host of heaven; and it cast down some of the host and of the stars to the ground, and stamped upon them. Yea, he magnified himself even to the prince of the host, and by him the daily sacrifice was taken away, and the place of his sanctuary was cast down. And an host was given him against the daily sacrifice by reason of transgression, and it cast down the truth to the ground; and it practised, and prospered.” —Daniel 8:9-12 Next, Daniel sees a little horn emerge. Using the principle of “repeat and expand” this can be none other than Rome in both its pagan and papal forms because Daniel chapter 2 and chapter 7 both point to Rome as the next kingdom after Greece. Later, this little horn is “broken without hand” (Daniel 8:25), meaning destroyed supernaturally by the coming of Christ, which is an echo of Daniel 2:34 where a stone “cut out without hands” puts an end to human civilization. This also fits with Daniel 7:24-27 where it says that papal Rome will be overcome by the kingdom of Christ. Daniel 8:9 gives another clue when it describes the direction of little horn’s expansion, which fits the expansion of Rome perfectly: toward the south (Egypt), toward the east (Macedonia), and the “pleasant land” (Palestine). Furthermore, Daniel 8:4 describes Medo-Persia as becoming “great,” Greece becomes “very great” (Daniel 8:8), and the little horn becomes “exceeding great.” Rome is the only power following Greece that became “exceeding great.” The little horn also “magnified himself even to the prince of the host” (Daniel 8:11), and verse 25 says it will “stand up against the Prince of princes” (Daniel 8:25). These are clear references to Jesus Christ, and once again, pagan Rome, being the power that crucified Him, fits these points. Papal Rome, on the other hand, effectively tries to replace Jesus’ ministry, as our High Priest in the heavenly sanctuary (Hebrews 8:1-2), with an earthly priesthood claiming to forgive sins even though the Bible teaches Jesus is our only Mediator (1 Timothy 2:5), and only God can forgive sins (Luke 5:21). This casts the truth of the heavenly sanctuary to the ground (Daniel 8:11), trampling it underfoot (Daniel 8:13), thereby fulfilling those points as well. How long would the sanctuary be trampled underfoot? “Then I heard one saint speaking, and another saint said unto that certain saint which spake, How long shall be the vision concerning the daily sacrifice, and the transgression of desolation, to give both the sanctuary and the host to be trodden under foot? And he said unto me, Unto two thousand and three hundred days; then shall the sanctuary be cleansed.” —Daniel 8:13-14 The reply was that the sanctuary would be cleansed after 2,300 days, which is 2,300 literal years in Bible prophecy (Ezekiel 4:6; Numbers 14:34). We’ve already learned that in the time of ancient Israel the earthly sanctuary was cleansed on the Day of Atonement. This was a day when the camp of Israel was cleansed from sin because God’s true followers were identified and their sins removed, while those who clung to sin were separated from the camp. In the same manner, Daniel is shown here that sin and the little horn power would not control and oppress the world forever; instead, God would intervene after 2,300 years with the heavenly Day of Atonement during which the process of removing sin would begin. To what time does this prophecy apply? “So he came near where I stood: and when he came, I was afraid, and fell upon my face: but he said unto me, Understand, O son of man: for at the time of the end shall be the vision.” —Daniel 8:17 “And the vision of the evening and the morning which was told is true: wherefore shut thou up the vision; for it shall be for many days.” —Daniel 8:26 The angel made it clear that this prophecy dealt with end time events, which means it’s particularly relevant for us. Daniel was perplexed by the vision and actually fell ill after receiving it (Daniel 8:27), but in the next chapter God sent the angel Gabriel to explain the vision to him (Daniel 9:21-23). How much time was alloted to Daniel’s people? “Seventy weeks are determined upon thy people and upon thy holy city, to finish the transgression, and to make an end of sins, and to make reconciliation for iniquity, and to bring in everlasting righteousness, and to seal up the vision and prophecy, and to anoint the most Holy.” —Daniel 9:24 The angel says that seventy weeks were alloted to the Jewish people, which would equal 490 days (70 7), which represent 490 years in Bible prophecy. At the time of the vision God’s people were in captivity in Medo-Persia, but soon they were to return home, and God was giving them 490 years out of the 2,300 as another opportunity to repent from their sins and be reconciled to Him. What was the starting point for the prophecy? “Know therefore and understand, that from the going forth of the command to restore and build Jerusalem until Messiah the Prince, there shall be seven weeks and sixty-two weeks; the street shall be built again, and the wall, even in troublesome times.” —Daniel 9:25, NKJV “And there went up some of the children of Israel, and of the priests, and the Levites, and the singers, and the porters, and the Nethinims, unto Jerusalem, in the seventh year of Artaxerxes the king.” —Ezra 7:7 The starting point was a decree authorizing God’s people to rebuild Jerusalem. The decree, recorded in Ezra 7:11-26, was issued by King Artaxerxes Longimanus in 457 B.C., in the seventh year of his reign, and implemented in the autumn of that year. This was the third in a series of three decrees: originated by Cyrus, re-affirmed by Darius, and completed by Artaxerxes. “And the elders of the Jews builded, and they prospered through the prophesying of Haggai the prophet and Zechariah the son of Iddo. And they builded, and finished it, according to the commandment of the God of Israel, and according to the commandment of Cyrus, and Darius, and Artaxerxes king of Persia.” —Ezra 6:14 The first two decrees dealt primarily with the rebuilding of the temple, but it was the third that established judges and counselors, in direct fulfillment of Isaiah’s prophecy, written before the Babylonian destruction of Jerusalem: “And I will restore thy judges as at the first, and thy counselors as at the beginning: afterward thou shalt be called, The city of righteousness, the faithful city. Zion shall be redeemed with judgment, and her converts with righteousness.” —Isaiah 1:26-27 Its fulfillment is found in the decree itself: “And thou, Ezra, after the wisdom of thy God, that is in thine hand, set magistrates and judges, which may judge all the people that are beyond the river, all such as know the laws of thy God; and teach ye them that know them not.” —Ezra 7:25 The rebuilding of the temple—authorized by the first two decrees—was not enough. The prophecy of Daniel 9:24, to “restore and rebuild Jerusalem,” could not be fulfilled until the Israelites regained the authority to appoint magistrates and judges to teach and restore the law of God, as had been the case before their Babylonian captivity. Following the restoration of judges, Isaiah 1:26-27 promised, “afterward thou shalt be called, The city of righteousness, the faithful city,” which was fulfilled in the Messiah, who would “bring in everlasting righteousness” (Daniel 9:24) through a perfectly righteous life, made available to all who receive Him by faith! How many weeks were there until the Messiah? “Know therefore and understand, that from the going forth of the command to restore and build Jerusalem until Messiah the Prince, there shall be seven weeks and sixty-two weeks; the street shall be built again, and the wall, even in troublesome times.” —Daniel 9:25, NKJV The angel said that from 457 B.C. there would be 69 weeks or 483 days (69 7), which represent 483 literal years. So starting with -457 and adding 483 gives us 26, but since there is no year 0, we add one year, which brings us to the year A.D. 27, the baptism of Jesus (Luke 3:21-22). The word “Messiah” means “anointed,” and it was during His baptism that He was anointed with the Holy Spirit (Acts 10:38). The baptism year is confirmed in Luke 3:1 as the fifteenth year of Tiberius Caesar’s reign (A.D. 27), which is remarkable considering the prophecy was made over 500 years before! After His baptism Jesus began to preach that “the time is fulfilled” (Mark 1:14-15), a clear reference to the 2,300 year prophecy and an indication of its importance. The prophecy, therefore, not only makes it plain that Jesus is the Messiah, but it also testifies that the Bible is divinely inspired! When was the Messiah to be “cut off”? “And after the sixty-two weeks Messiah shall be cut off, but not for Himself; and the people of the prince who is to come shall destroy the city and the sanctuary. The end of it shall be with a flood, and till the end of the war desolations are determined. Then He shall confirm a covenant with many for one week; but in the middle of the week He shall bring an end to sacrifice and offering. And on the wing of abominations shall be one who makes desolate, even until the consummation, which is determined, is poured out on the desolate.” —Daniel 9:26-27, NKJV “But He was wounded for our transgressions, He was bruised for our iniquities: the chastisement of our peace was upon Him; and with His stripes we are healed.” —Isaiah 53:5 Since there are 69 weeks from 457 B.C. to A.D. 27, there is one week left (7 days, that is, 7 years) in the 490 year prophecy. In the middle of that last week in A.D. 31, three and a half years after His baptism, Jesus was “cut off” (crucified) not for Himself, since He was sinless (1 Peter 2:22), but for us, thereby bringing an end to the system of animal sacrifices, which was confirmed by the veil in the temple being miraculously torn from top to bottom (Matthew 27:50-51). The One to whom all the sacrifices pointed gave Himself, as the great and true sacrifice, for the remission of our sins (Romans 3:25; 1 Corinthians 15:3), to heal us from the wound of sin! By the way, the Passover lamb was sacrificed every year on the 14th day of the Hebrew month of Nisan, and Jesus, our Passover Lamb, died exactly on that day! The priests were getting ready to sacrifice the Passover lamb as the true Lamb was hanging on the cross, about to be sacrificed for the sins of the world (1 Corinthians 5:7). And all of this was predicted before it even happened by a God who sees the end from the beginning (Isaiah 46:10)! What significant event occured next? “Then He shall confirm a covenant with many for one week; but in the middle of the week He shall bring an end to sacrifice and offering. And on the wing of abominations shall be one who makes desolate, even until the consummation, which is determined, is poured out on the desolate.” —Daniel 9:27, NKJV “How shall we escape, if we neglect so great salvation; which at the first began to be spoken by the Lord, and was confirmed unto us by them that heard him.” —Hebrews 2:3 Once Jesus died and ascended to heaven, His earthly ministry ended, but He confirmed the covenant, to save His people from their sins (Hebrews 10:16-17), through His disciples, whom He sent to preach to the Jewish nation first (Matthew 10:5-6) because they still had three and a half years remaining as part of their 490-year opportunity to repent from their sins. This period came to an end in A.D. 34, three and a half years after Jesus’ death, when the testimony of Stephen was rejected by the Jewish religious leaders, and he ended up being stoned to death (Acts 7:54-60). This final, collective rejection of God’s plan to save them meant that the Jews could no longer be His exclusive people, and from A.D. 34, the disciples started preaching the gospel to all the nations of the world (Matthew 21:43; Acts 8:4; 13:46). Who are God’s chosen people now? “For as many of you as have been baptized into Christ have put on Christ. There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither bond nor free, there is neither male nor female: for ye are all one in Christ Jesus. And if ye be Christ’s, then are ye Abraham’s seed, and heirs according to the promise.” —Galatians 3:27-29 “For the scripture saith, Whosoever believeth on him shall not be ashamed. For there is no difference between the Jew and the Greek: for the same Lord over all is rich unto all that call upon him. For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.” —Romans 10:11-13 “For he is not a Jew, which is one outwardly; neither is that circumcision, which is outward in the flesh: But he is a Jew, which is one inwardly; and circumcision is that of the heart, in the spirit, and not in the letter; whose praise is not of men, but of God.” —Romans 2:28-29 God’s people are now those of any nation who choose to accept and serve Him, becoming spiritual Jews—spiritual descendants of Abraham, fulfilling the promise God gave to Abraham that in him all the families of the earth would be blessed (Genesis 12:1-3). But, of course, spiritual Jews also include any Jewish person who individually accepts Jesus as Lord and Savior. What happens at the end of the 2,300 year prophecy? “And he said unto me, Unto two thousand and three hundred days; then shall the sanctuary be cleansed.” —Daniel 8:14 “It was therefore necessary that the patterns of things in the heavens should be purified with these; but the heavenly things themselves with better sacrifices than these.” —Hebrews 9:23 “And I saw another angel fly in the midst of heaven, having the everlasting gospel to preach unto them that dwell on the earth, and to every nation, and kindred, and tongue, and people, saying with a loud voice, Fear God, and give glory to him; for the hour of his judgment is come: and worship him that made heaven, and earth, and the sea, and the fountains of waters.” —Revelation 14:6-7 After the 490 year prophecy ended in A.D. 34, there were 1,810 years remaining in the 2,300 year one (2,300 minus 490), which means it ended in 1844. According to Daniel, this was the year when the cleansing of the sanctuary began. We’ve already learned that when the system of animal sacrifices was made obsolete by the death of Jesus, the veil of the temple was torn by the divine hand of God. Shortly after, the temple itself was destroyed by the Romans in A.D. 70 and never rebuilt, so the sanctuary that is cleansed can only be the heavenly one, of which the earthly one was a symbol. The cleansing of the earthly sanctuary always occured on the Day of Atonement (to “atone” means to be “at one” with God), which was a time of judgment during which God’s people examined their souls to make sure all of their sins were confessed, forsaken, and symbolically “blotted out” from the sanctuary; likewise, the heavenly judgment began in 1844 and the sins of God’s people began to be removed from the books of heaven (Daniel 7:10). In other words, prior to 1844, confessed and forsaken sins were forgiven by God because of Jesus’ substitutionary sacrifice on the sinners behalf, but they remained on the books. After 1844, when the heavenly judgment began, God started to blot out even the very record of those confessed sins (Acts 3:19)! Who is being judged first? “For the time is come that judgment must begin at the house of God: and if it first begin at us, what shall the end be of them that obey not the gospel of God?” —1 Peter 4:17 “And to the others he said in mine hearing, Go ye after him through the city, and smite: let not your eye spare, neither have ye pity: slay utterly old and young, both maids, and little children, and women: but come not near any man upon whom is the mark; and begin at my sanctuary. Then they began at the ancient men which were before the house.” —Ezekiel 9:5-6 In the Bible judgment always begins with God’s people. The heavenly judgment that began in 1844 is the “pre-advent judgment,” the first phase, since it occurs before the second coming of Christ. Jesus returns with His reward (Revelation 22:11-12), which means those who are saved have been identified and their reward determined. Just like in the earthly Day of Atonement judgment there was a separation of the unrepentant from the camp of Israel before sin was removed from the sanctuary (Leviticus 23:29), so in the heavenly sanctuary there is an identification of who is saved and who is lost during the pre-advent judgment. This is why Peter says the judgment begins with the “house of God,” meaning the people of God. Anyone who has claimed to be a Christian, alive or dead, will be examined during this judgment. And it’s already in session (Revelation 14:7), which is why we are called to put away our sins and be “at one” with God. We are the temple of God now that there is no longer an earthly sanctuary. It’s us that God wants to cleanse from sin because His desire is to abide in us through His Holy Spirit (1 Corinthians 6:19-20). When is the second phase of the judgment? “Do ye not know that the saints shall judge the world? and if the world shall be judged by you, are ye unworthy to judge the smallest matters? Know ye not that we shall judge angels? how much more things that pertain to this life?” —1 Corinthians 6:3 “And I saw thrones, and they sat upon them, and judgment was given unto them: and I saw the souls of them that were beheaded for the witness of Jesus, and for the word of God, and which had not worshipped the beast, neither his image, neither had received his mark upon their foreheads, or in their hands; and they lived and reigned with Christ a thousand years.” —Revelation 20:4 After Jesus takes the saved to heaven, they will participate in the second phase of the judgment, during which the life of every lost person, including Satan and his angels, will be examined and all questions will be answered. Ultimately, the saved will agree that Jesus’ judgments were not arbitrary, but just and true (Revelation 15:3). They will see that Jesus only confirms the decision that has already been made in a person’s heart to either serve Him or another (Revelation 22:11-12). When is the third phase? “And I saw a great white throne, and him that sat on it, from whose face the earth and the heaven fled away; and there was found no place for them. And I saw the dead, small and great, stand before God; and the books were opened: and another book was opened, which is the book of life: and the dead were judged out of those things which were written in the books, according to their works.” —Revelation 20:11-12 “For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ; that every one may receive the things done in his body, according to that he hath done, whether it be good or bad.” —2 Corinthians 5:10 “But why dost thou judge thy brother? or why dost thou set at nought thy brother? for we shall all stand before the judgment seat of Christ. For it is written, As I live, saith the Lord, every knee shall bow to me, and every tongue shall confess to God. So then every one of us shall give account of himself to God.” —Romans 14:10-12 The third phase of the judgment is for the lost of all ages, and it takes place after the 1,000 years. Every lost soul will look back on his or her life and remember God’s patient calls to repentance—the numerous convictions of the Holy Spirit that were repeatedly refused. The books will be opened and God’s attempts to save every person will be made plain. The lost will understand that God did everything He could to save them, and every person will fall on their knees, including Satan and his angels, in confession that God has been just and fair in His dealing with every soul (Philippians 2:10-11; Romans 14:11). The lost will realize they can only blame their own resistance to God’s pleadings of mercy (Hosea 13:9), and they acknowledge His love, mercy, and justice, clearing Him of all false accusations. What happens next? “And they went up on the breadth of the earth, and compassed the camp of the saints about, and the beloved city: and fire came down from God out of heaven, and devoured them. And the devil that deceived them was cast into the lake of fire and brimstone, where the beast and the false prophet are, and shall be tormented day and night for ever and ever.” —Revelation 20:9-10 In the end, God will honor the choices of Satan, his angels, and all people who joined his rebellion and rejected His mercy (Revelation 22:11-12). In order to cleanse the universe from sin, and because life cannot exist apart from the Life-Giver, the lives of those who chose to cling to sin, despite receiving numerous opportunities to be cleansed from it, will come to an end in the fire that will fall from heaven. Ultimately, this is an act of mercy because sin only leads to pain, suffering, and sorrow; nevertheless, the act will bring immeasurable anguish to the heart of God (Ezekiel 33:11) because these are people whom He loved so much that He sent His only Son to die for them (John 3:16). No doubt Jesus will weep over those whom He wanted to save. Guardian angels will likely weep over the ones they served to protect. It will be a time of immense sorrow for the saved as well because it’s likely many will have a loved one in the fire. The good news is the fire does not burn forever. The pain and suffering will come to an end, and God will create a new earth on which He will dwell with His people (Revelation 21:1-5). The harmony that existed between Adam, Eve, and their Creator will be restored, and sin will never rise up again (Nahum 1:9)! What good news do we have? “There is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit.” —Romans 8:1 “If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.” —1 John 1:9 The judgment has been in session since 1844, and even though it may seem like a dreadful thing to many, it’s actually full of good news: - The central purpose of the judgment is to vindicate God’s character and government before the universe, because Lucifer, in his rebellion, suggested that, if given the chance, he would establish a better form of government than God, but in the end, every human and angel, including Satan, will bow in confession that God’s ways are love, mercy, and justice (Philippians 2:10-11; Revelation 15:3). - The judgment is declared in favor of God’s people (Daniel 7:21-22) because all of their sins have been confessed, forgiven, and cleansed by Jesus (1 John 1:9); there is no condemnation to those who are in Christ (Romans 8:1). - Those who rejected God’s mercy will not be tortured in hell endlessly (Malachi 4:1). - Jesus presides as Judge (John 5:22); He is also the Advocate and the Witness for the saved (1 John 2:1; Revelation 3:14). With Jesus on my side, I have nothing to fear. - The Father and the Son want every person to be saved (John 3:16; 13:1; 1 Timothy 2:3-4); Satan is our only accusser (Revelation 12:10). The judgment revolves around the atonement, being “at one” or reconciled with God, and Jesus is in the center of it all! He is the only One who can remove sin from our lives (Acts 4:12). If you haven’t done so, now is the time to get right with God and accept Jesus as Lord and Savior (2 Corinthians 6:2). God is still offering forgiveness and mercy to those who come to His throne (Hebrews 4:14-16; 7:25), and Jesus is still knocking (Revelation 3:20).\",\"series\":\"Facing Judgment\"},\"30\":{\"title\":\"Will I Be Judged?\",\"url\":\"/prophecy/judgment/\",\"category\":\"Prophecy\",\"description\":\"Am I my own ruler? Or am I responsible to a higher Authority for the way I live my life?\",\"body\":\"Has the judgment already begun? “And I saw another angel fly in the midst of heaven, having the everlasting gospel to preach unto them that dwell on the earth, and to every nation, and kindred, and tongue, and people, saying with a loud voice, Fear God, and give glory to him; for the hour of his judgment is come: and worship him that made heaven, and earth, and the sea, and the fountains of waters.” —Revelation 14:6-7 “And, behold, I come quickly; and my reward is with me, to give every man according as his work shall be.” —Revelation 22:12 In Acts 24:25 Paul talks about a coming judgment, meaning it had not happened yet. In Revelation 14, on the other hand, there are three angels proclaiming a message to the people of the world in the last days, and the first angel’s message is that the judgment has begun. So the judgment begins in the last days, which we are living in. When Jesus comes back to earth He’s bringing a reward with Him, which means the judgment has already taken place to decide who will be saved and what their reward will be. Who will be judged? “For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ; that every one may receive the things done in his body, according to that he hath done, whether it be good or bad.” —2 Corinthians 5:10 “So then every one of us shall give account of himself to God.” —Romans 14:12 Every person who has ever lived on planet earth will be judged. Furthermore, each person will be responsible for his or her own actions; it will not be possible to hide behind another person’s decisions, actions, or ultimatums. Who else is part of the judgment? “I beheld till the thrones were cast down, and the Ancient of Days did sit, whose garment was white as snow, and the hair of his head like the pure wool: his throne was like the fiery flame, and his wheels as burning fire. A fiery stream issued and came forth from before him: thousand thousands ministered unto him, and ten thousand times ten thousand stood before him: the judgment was set, and the books were opened.” —Daniel 7:9-10 “For the Father judgeth no man, but hath committed all judgment unto the Son.” —John 5:22 “My little children, these things write I unto you, that ye sin not. And if any man sin, we have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous.” —1 John 2:1 “And the great dragon was cast out, that old serpent, called the Devil, and Satan, which deceiveth the whole world: he was cast out into the earth … for the accuser of our brethren is cast down, which accused them before our God day and night.” —Revelation 12:9-10 God the Father, the Ancient of Days, presides over the judgment, while Jesus is the Judge, as well as our Advocate! Satan is our only accusser, declaring that we don’t deserve to be saved any more than he does. Is it possible to hide anything from God? “Let us hear the conclusion of the whole matter: Fear God, and keep his commandments: for this is the whole duty of man. For God shall bring every work into judgment, with every secret thing, whether it be good, or whether it be evil.” —Ecclesiastes 12:13-14 “But I say unto you, That every idle word that men shall speak, they shall give account thereof in the day of judgment.” —Matthew 12:36 “Neither is there any creature that is not manifest in his sight: but all things are naked and opened unto the eyes of him with whom we have to do.” —Hebrews 4:13 “Therefore judge nothing before the time, until the Lord come, who both will bring to light the hidden things of darkness, and will make manifest the counsels of the hearts: and then shall every man have praise of God.” —1 Corinthians 4:5 Does God keep a record of evidence for the judgment? “And I saw the dead, small and great, stand before God; and the books were opened: and another book was opened, which is the book of life: and the dead were judged out of those things which were written in the books, according to their works.” —Revelation 20:12 “And there shall in no wise enter into it any thing that defileth, neither whatsoever worketh abomination, or maketh a lie: but they which are written in the Lamb’s book of life.” —Revelation 21:27 “For though thou wash thee with nitre, and take thee much soap, yet thine iniquity is marked before me, saith the Lord GOD.” —Jeremiah 2:22 “Then those who feared the Lord spoke to one another, and the Lord listened attentively and heard it, and a book of remembrance was written before Him for those who fear the Lord and esteem His name.” —Malachi 3:16, NASB Evidence for the judgment comes from books containing every detail of a person’s life, including every sin. There is also a Book of Remembrance containing every kind word, unselfish act, or sacrifice made by those who follow Jesus as evidence of God’s transforming power in their lives. These people’s names are also written in the Book of Life. What is God’s standard in the judgment? “If ye fulfil the royal law according to the scripture, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself, ye do well: But if ye have respect to persons, ye commit sin, and are convinced of the law as transgressors. For whosoever shall keep the whole law, and yet offend in one point, he is guilty of all. For he that said, Do not commit adultery, said also, Do not kill. Now if thou commit no adultery, yet if thou kill, thou art become a transgressor of the law. So speak ye, and so do, as they that shall be judged by the law of liberty.” —James 2:10-12 “Whosoever committeth sin transgresseth also the law: for sin is the transgression of the law.” —1 John 3:4 If God keeps a record of our sins, and sin is the transgression of the law, then the Ten Commandment law is God’s standard by which we will be judged. Is anyone righteous before the law? “For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God.” —Romans 3:23 “Wherefore, as by one man sin entered into the world, and death by sin; and so death passed upon all men, for that all have sinned.” —Romans 5:12 Because all have sinned, everyone is under condemnation before the law. If nothing is done to remedy the situation, by default, every person sits on “death row” and simply waits for the judgment. How can my record of sin be blotted out? “Repent ye therefore, and be converted, that your sins may be blotted out, when the times of refreshing shall come from the presence of the Lord.” —Acts 3:19 “Seek ye the LORD while he may be found, call ye upon him while he is near: Let the wicked forsake his way, and the unrighteous man his thoughts: and let him return unto the LORD, and he will have mercy upon him; and to our God, for he will abundantly pardon.” —Isaiah 55:6-7 Even though all have sinned, every person has hope of forgiveness! God the Father offers forgiveness to all who come to Him in repentance and forsaking of sin. What role does Jesus play in this? “But this man, because he continueth ever, hath an unchangeable priesthood. Wherefore he is able also to save them to the uttermost that come unto God by him, seeing he ever liveth to make intercession for them.” —Hebrews 7:24-25 “For we have not an high priest which cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities; but was in all points tempted like as we are, yet without sin. Let us therefore come boldly unto the throne of grace, that we may obtain mercy, and find grace to help in time of need.” —Hebrews 4:15-16 “I will bear the indignation of the LORD, because I have sinned against him, until he plead my cause, and execute judgment for me: he will bring me forth to the light, and I shall behold his righteousness.” —Micah 7:9 Because Jesus understands us and can sympathize with our weaknesses, He intercedes on our behalf when we come to the Father through Him, asking for forgiveness. As our Advocate, He pleads the case of every repentant sinner who is accused by Satan, ensuring that we do not face judgment alone. In fact, we are incapable of winning our case without Him. However, not only is Jesus with us in judgment, but He never brings judgment upon us apart from Himself; instead, He first brings it upon Himself, bearing its condemnation on our behalf (2 Corinthians 5:21; 1 Peter 2:24; Galatians 3:13-14). Judgment, therefore, is a revelation of the heart of God and a vindication of His character, for none of the angels—Satan himself included—could have imagined that their Commander would be willing to take on human nature and hang on the cross for His beloved creation. What role does the Holy Spirit play? “Nevertheless I tell you the truth; It is expedient for you that I go away: for if I go not away, the Comforter will not come unto you; but if I depart, I will send him unto you. And when he is come, he will reprove the world of sin, and of righteousness, and of judgment.” —John 16:7-8 “But the Comforter, which is the Holy Ghost, whom the Father will send in my name, he shall teach you all things, and bring all things to your remembrance, whatsoever I have said unto you.” —John 14:26 The Holy Spirit plays a crucial role as well by convicting us of sin and bringing to remembrance sins we have not confessed yet so there isn’t a single unconfessed sin left in our heavenly record for Satan to point to as a witness against us in the judgment. What happens to those whose record of sin has been removed? “There is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit. For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus hath made me free from the law of sin and death. For what the law could not do, in that it was weak through the flesh, God sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh, and for sin, condemned sin in the flesh: that the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit.” —Romans 8:1-4 “He that overcometh, the same shall be clothed in white raiment; and I will not blot out his name out of the book of life, but I will confess his name before my Father, and before his angels.” —Revelation 3:5 “Notwithstanding in this rejoice not, that the spirits are subject unto you; but rather rejoice, because your names are written in heaven.” —Luke 10:20 Those whose record of sin has been blotted out are no longer under condemnation because they have been forgiven through Christ, who paid the penalty for their sin on the cross and who stands before the law on their behalf with His perfect character. The law can now be fulfilled in them through the abiding presence and enabling power of the Spirit, and their names will not be blotted out from the Book of Life! What warning did Jesus give to Christians? “And take heed to yourselves, lest at any time your hearts be overcharged with surfeiting, and drunkenness, and cares of this life, and so that day come upon you unawares.” —Luke 21:34 “For the Son of man is as a man taking a far journey, who left his house, and gave authority to his servants, and to every man his work, and commanded the porter to watch. Watch ye therefore: for ye know not when the master of the house cometh, at even, or at midnight, or at the cockcrowing, or in the morning: Lest coming suddenly he find you sleeping.” —Mark 13:34-36 Jesus warned about four specific things: - Surfeiting: This means “excess,” and it can be anything that disturbs balance and violates the principle of temperance (Galatians 5:22-25), such as overeating, overwork, or even recreation, which is very beneficial when done it moderation. - Drunkenness: This is anything that brings about a spiritual stupor, destroys clear thinking, and removes our desire for heavenly things. Examples include pornography, alcoholism, illicit sex, worldly entertainment, and so on, because they lead to living in a dream world. - Cares of this life: These are perfectly fine activities that are a part of life, but when they take over our lives they take time away from Jesus and shift our focus away from eternal realities, leading to less time spent in prayer, studying His word, and being an active member of His church. - Sleeping: Jesus is referring to spiritually asleep here, and this involves taking the Bible and the truth it reveals about Him for granted. It’s being indifferent about our relationship with Jesus and neglecting the principles of His kingdom (2 Timothy 3:5). In Revelation 3:15-19 it’s described as being lukewarm—being falsely satisfied with one’s own spiritual condition and not being actively involved in the work of Jesus. Perhaps the biggest problem with sleep is being unaware that one is asleep! But the good news is Jesus still patiently knocks at the door of the heart. Have you let Him in? What did Felix do when he was convicted? “And as he reasoned of righteousness, temperance, and judgment to come, Felix trembled, and answered, Go thy way for this time; when I have a convenient season, I will call for thee.” —Acts 24:25 “For he saith, I have heard thee in a time accepted, and in the day of salvation have I succoured thee: behold, now is the accepted time; behold, now is the day of salvation.” —2 Corinthians 6:2 When the Holy Spirit convicts it is not wise to ignore it or put it off to a more convenient time because that time may never come.

The truth may shock you.\",\"body\":\"What did Jesus promise prior to His crucifixion? “Let not your heart be troubled: ye believe in God, believe also in me. In my Father’s house are many mansions: if it were not so, I would have told you. I go to prepare a place for you. And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again, and receive you unto myself; that where I am, there ye may be also.” —John 14:1-3 When Jesus speaks, His word cannot fail; it will be fulfilled. Just as light appeared when He said, “Let there be light,” we can be just as certain that Jesus is coming back for His people to take them to heaven with Him—simply because He said so. How will He come back? “And when he had spoken these things, while they beheld, he was taken up; and a cloud received him out of their sight. And while they looked stedfastly toward heaven as he went up, behold, two men stood by them in white apparel; which also said, Ye men of Galilee, why stand ye gazing up into heaven? this same Jesus, which is taken up from you into heaven, shall so come in like manner as ye have seen him go into heaven.” —Acts 1:9-11 Jesus will return in a visible, bodily, and personal manner, just as He left. In other words, He will come literally—in a body of flesh and bones. Will it be possible to miss His coming? “Behold, he cometh with clouds; and every eye shall see him, and they also which pierced him: and all kindreds of the earth shall wail because of him. Even so, Amen.” —Revelation 1:7 “For as the lightning cometh out of the east, and shineth even unto the west; so shall also the coming of the Son of man be.” —Matthew 24:27 “Our God shall come, and shall not keep silence: a fire shall devour before him, and it shall be very tempestuous round about him.” —Psalm 50:3 “For the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the archangel, and with the trump of God: and the dead in Christ shall rise first.” —1 Thessalonians 4:16 Contrary to the popular but unbiblical teaching of a secret rapture, Christ’s second coming will be anything but silent or secret. It will be, in fact, the most awe-inspiring, thunderous, and radiant event in Earth’s history—utterly impossible to miss. Proponents of the secret rapture theory believe the rapture will be followed by a seven-year tribulation, during which those who were not taken to heaven will have another opportunity to repent and be saved. But offering such a second chance makes God appear arbitrary and unfair, granting one group a new opportunity for salvation while denying it to others. Furthermore, the theory provides false security to those who wish to continue in sin, as they may presume they can repent during the tribulation. How devastating will it be when they realize there is no second chance and that they have squandered the only one they had? Luke 17:34-36 is often cited as biblical evidence of a secret rapture, yet the context shows that Jesus was referring to the judgments in the days of Noah and Lot (Luke 17:26-29). In each case, a few were “taken” to safety while the rest were “left” to be destroyed: Noah and his family escaped safely in the ark, while Lot and his daughters fled the doomed city. Jesus warned that the same pattern will be repeated at His coming (Luke 17:30): the saved will be gathered to meet Him in the air (1 Thessalonians 4:16-17), while the lost will be destroyed by the brightness of His coming (2 Thessalonians 2:8). What else will take place? “For the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the archangel, and with the trump of God: and the dead in Christ shall rise first: then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air: and so shall we ever be with the Lord.” —1 Thessalonians 4:16-17 The Bible teaches that those who have died in Christ will be resurrected, and together with the living who are ready for His return, will be caught up to meet Him in the air to spend a thousand years in heaven. Because He remains in the air and does not touch the earth, His coming will not be an earthly appearance, but one in the sky—an important detail that helps us identify counterfeit christs (Matthew 24:4-5). Put simply, if anyone—even an angel—appears on the earth and claims to be Christ, we can be certain this contradicts Scripture, for Paul plainly states that the redeemed will meet Jesus in the air, meaning He will remain in the clouds above the earth. This is confirmed by the two angels’ declaration at Christ’s ascension: “This same Jesus, which is taken up from you into heaven, shall so come in like manner as ye have seen him go into heaven” (Acts 1:11). In other words, just as He ascended into heaven, He will likewise descend from heaven at His Second Coming. What kind of bodies will the saved have? “Behold, I shew you a mystery; We shall not all sleep, but we shall all be changed, in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trump: for the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed. For this corruptible must put on incorruption, and this mortal must put on immortality. So when this corruptible shall have put on incorruption, and this mortal shall have put on immortality, then shall be brought to pass the saying that is written, Death is swallowed up in victory.” —1 Corinthians 15:51-54 “… we look for the Saviour, the Lord Jesus Christ: Who shall change our vile body, that it may be fashioned like unto his glorious body, according to the working whereby he is able even to subdue all things unto himself.” —Philippians 3:20-21 The redeemed—both the living and the resurrected—will receive new, perfect, glorified, and immortal bodies at Jesus’ coming. How will the saved respond? “And it shall be said in that day, Lo, this is our God; we have waited for him, and he will save us: this is the LORD; we have waited for him, we will be glad and rejoice in his salvation.” —Isaiah 25:9 Christ’s coming will either be the best day of one’s life or the worst. Those who have loved Him enough to surrender their hearts to Him and submit to His will, through the power of the Holy Spirit (1 Corinthians 6:11), will rejoice at His appearing because He has become their best Friend and Lord of their lives. How will the lost respond? “And the heaven departed as a scroll when it is rolled together; and every mountain and island were moved out of their places. And the kings of the earth, and the great men, and the rich men, and the chief captains, and the mighty men, and every bondman, and every free man, hid themselves in the dens and in the rocks of the mountains; and said to the mountains and rocks, Fall on us, and hide us from the face of him that sitteth on the throne, and from the wrath of the Lamb: for the great day of his wrath is come; and who shall be able to stand?” —Revelation 6:14-17 In contrast to those who are saved, the lost—who had a superficial Christianity that never moved beyond mere profession, never surrendering all that they had and were to Him (Matthew 7:21-23)—will experience no peace or joy at Christ’s coming. To them, His coming will be a terrifying experience, so much so that they will seek death rather than face their Creator. Because they have chosen to cling to sin, they will be destroyed by the brightness of His coming, for anyone who holds on to sin cannot live in the presence of a holy God. Sin will be destroyed by Christ one way or another, because it is a manifestation of selfishness, which has no place in His kingdom of love. The only question is: will we be destroyed with it? He can either purge us from our sins now (Malachi 3:3), as we invite Him to take over our lives, or He will purge us along with our sins at His coming. But how can we be washed now? By His Word! When we read the Bible, it begins to read us (Hebrews 4:2), bringing conviction that, if yielded to, will cleanse us from sin (Ephesians 5:26). But if we neglect it, that same conviction will come at His appearing—at which point it will be too late to do anything about it. Now is the time to come to know Christ through His Word and to be transformed by His grace. Why must the lost be kept out of heaven? “He answered and said unto them, He that soweth the good seed is the Son of man; the field is the world; the good seed are the children of the kingdom; but the tares are the children of the wicked one; the enemy that sowed them is the devil; the harvest is the end of the world; and the reapers are the angels. As therefore the tares are gathered and burned in the fire; so shall it be in the end of this world. The Son of man shall send forth his angels, and they shall gather out of his kingdom all things that offend, and them which do iniquity; and shall cast them into a furnace of fire: there shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth. Then shall the righteous shine forth as the sun in the kingdom of their Father. Who hath ears to hear, let him hear.” —Matthew 13:37-43 “Nevertheless we, according to his promise, look for new heavens and a new earth, wherein dwelleth righteousness.” —2 Peter 3:13 “And there shall in no wise enter into it any thing that defileth, neither whatsoever worketh abomination, or maketh a lie: but they which are written in the Lamb’s book of life.” —Revelation 21:27 Because heaven is a place where righteousness dwells, anyone who clings to sin cannot be happy there. Excluding those who have repeatedly resisted God’s wooing grace and chosen to persist in sin is, in fact, an act of mercy toward the unconverted, for heaven would be a place of torment to those who have no longing for righteousness. It also secures the eternal peace and happiness of the citizens of God’s everlasting kingdom, for the removal of sin means the end of the pain, suffering, and misery that it always brings. Will there be a third group of people? “He that is unjust, let him be unjust still: and he which is filthy, let him be filthy still: and he that is righteous, let him be righteous still: and he that is holy, let him be holy still. And, behold, I come quickly; and my reward is with me, to give every man according as his work shall be.” —Revelation 22:11-12 “When the Son of man shall come in his glory, and all the holy angels with him, then shall he sit upon the throne of his glory: and before him shall be gathered all nations: and he shall separate them one from another, as a shepherd divideth his sheep from the goats: and he shall set the sheep on his right hand, but the goats on the left.” —Matthew 25:31-33 When Jesus returns, there will be only two groups of people—the saved and the lost. By then, it will be too late to change sides, for He will return with His reward, showing that judgment has already taken place and every case has been decided. In fact, the citizens of God’s eternal kingdom will have been determined when probation closes, which happens before His Second Coming—just as the door of Noah’s ark was shut seven days before the rain began (Genesis 7:10). How is Jesus portrayed when He returns? “And I saw heaven opened, and behold a white horse; and he that sat upon him was called Faithful and True, and in righteousness he doth judge and make war. His eyes were as a flame of fire, and on his head were many crowns; and he had a name written, that no man knew, but he himself. And he was clothed with a vesture dipped in blood: and his name is called The Word of God. And the armies which were in heaven followed him upon white horses, clothed in fine linen, white and clean. And out of his mouth goeth a sharp sword, that with it he should smite the nations: and he shall rule them with a rod of iron: and he treadeth the winepress of the fierceness and wrath of Almighty God. And he hath on his vesture and on his thigh a name written, KING OF KINGS, AND LORD OF LORDS.” —Revelation 19:11-16 Because He has triumphed over Satan, Jesus will return as the victorious King, accompanied by the innumerable host of His angelic army. What happens to the earth and the lost? “And the seventh angel poured out his vial into the air; and there came a great voice out of the temple of heaven, from the throne, saying, It is done. And there were voices, and thunders, and lightnings; and there was a great earthquake, such as was not since men were upon the earth, so mighty an earthquake, and so great. And the great city was divided into three parts, and the cities of the nations fell: and great Babylon came in remembrance before God, to give unto her the cup of the wine of the fierceness of his wrath. And every island fled away, and the mountains were not found. And there fell upon men a great hail out of heaven, every stone about the weight of a talent: and men blasphemed God because of the plague of the hail; for the plague thereof was exceeding great.” —Revelation 16:17-21 “I beheld the earth, and, lo, it was without form, and void; and the heavens, and they had no light. I beheld the mountains, and, lo, they trembled, and all the hills moved lightly. I beheld, and, lo, there was no man, and all the birds of the heavens were fled. I beheld, and, lo, the fruitful place was a wilderness, and all the cities thereof were broken down at the presence of the LORD, and by his fierce anger. For thus hath the LORD said, The whole land shall be desolate; yet will I not make a full end.” —Jeremiah 4:23-27 “And then shall that Wicked be revealed, whom the Lord shall consume with the spirit of his mouth, and shall destroy with the brightness of his coming: even him, whose coming is after the working of Satan with all power and signs and lying wonders, and with all deceivableness of unrighteousness in them that perish; because they received not the love of the truth, that they might be saved.” —2 Thessalonians 2:8-10 “And the slain of the LORD shall be at that day from one end of the earth even unto the other end of the earth: they shall not be lamented, neither gathered, nor buried; they shall be dung upon the ground.” —Jeremiah 25:33 The Bible teaches that just before Christ’s return, during the outpouring of the seven last plagues described in Revelation 16, the earth will be utterly devastated and rendered uninhabitable. Those of the lost who survive the plagues will be slain by the brightness of His glory, and since Christ will take the redeemed to heaven, the earth will, for the first time since creation week, be completely devoid of all life. This desolation makes the belief in an earthly millennium following Christ’s return an impossibility. Could it be that part of the reason the earth is completely destroyed at Christ’s coming is that it was being worshiped? What invitation does Revelation give us? “And the Spirit and the bride say, Come. And let him that heareth say, Come. And let him that is athirst come. And whosoever will, let him take the water of life freely. … He which testifieth these things saith, Surely I come quickly. Amen. Even so, come, Lord Jesus.” —Revelation 22:17, 20 “Behold, I stand at the door, and knock: if any man hear my voice, and open the door, I will come in to him, and will sup with him, and he with me.” —Revelation 3:20 “But as many as received him, to them gave he power to become the sons of God, even to them that believe on his name.” —John 1:12 “While it is said, Today if ye will hear his voice, harden not your hearts, as in the provocation.” —Hebrews 3:15 One day the door of mercy will close forever; one day the summer will end and the harvest will pass (Jeremiah 8:20). People will then run to and fro seeking salvation, but it will be too late (Amos 8:11-12). There is no reason to end in such a tragedy, yet there is not a moment to lose (Matthew 24:44; Luke 21:34-35).

A microchip perhaps? Discover what the Bible really says about this misunderstood mark.\",\"body\":\"How does the Bible describe the beast? “And I stood upon the sand of the sea, and saw a beast rise up out of the sea, having seven heads and ten horns, and upon his horns ten crowns, and upon his heads the name of blasphemy. And the beast which I saw was like unto a leopard, and his feet were as the feet of a bear, and his mouth as the mouth of a lion: and the dragon gave him his power, and his seat, and great authority. ““And I saw one of his heads as it were wounded to death; and his deadly wound was healed: and all the world wondered after the beast. And they worshipped the dragon which gave power unto the beast: and they worshipped the beast, saying, Who is like unto the beast? who is able to make war with him? And there was given unto him a mouth speaking great things and blasphemies; and power was given unto him to continue forty and two months. And he opened his mouth in blasphemy against God, to blaspheme his name, and his tabernacle, and them that dwell in heaven. ““And it was given unto him to make war with the saints, and to overcome them: and power was given him over all kindreds, and tongues, and nations. And all that dwell upon the earth shall worship him, whose names are not written in the book of life of the Lamb slain from the foundation of the world. If any man have an ear, let him hear. He that leadeth into captivity shall go into captivity: he that killeth with the sword must be killed with the sword. Here is the patience and the faith of the saints.” —Revelation 13:1-10 “Here is wisdom. Let him that hath understanding count the number of the beast: for it is the number of a man; and his number is six hundred threescore and six.” —Revelation 13:18 Before identifying the mark of the beast, we must first identify the beast itself. The Bible gives 11 characteristics: 1. It rises out of the sea (Revelation 13:1), 1. It is the composite of the four beasts of Daniel 7 (Revelation 13:2), 1. The dragon gives it power and authority (Revelation 13:2), 1. It receives a deadly wound (Revelation 13:3), 1. Its deadly wound is healed (Revelation 13:3), 1. It becomes a strong political power (Revelation 13:3, 7), 1. It becomes a strong religious power (Revelation 13:3, 8), 1. It speaks blasphemy against God (Revelation 13:1, 5, 6), 1. It wars against the saints and overcomes them (Revelation 13:7), 1. It rules for 42 months (Revelation 13:5), 1. It has the mysterious number of 666 (Revelation 13:18). What power is represented here? The Bible often operates on the principle of repetition where previously covered subjects are repeated and new details added. If some of these characteristics described in Revelation 13 sound familiar it’s because the beast described here is the same power as the little horn of Daniel 7, which we previously learned represents the papacy. Now it’s worth repeating that this is not a condemnation of Roman Catholics; rather, the Bible is pointing out a system—Catholicism. In other places the Bible also points out the faults of the Jewish and Protestant faiths. Moreover, God has devoted Christians in all churches, including the Roman Catholic church. It’s also true that the papacy has done many good deeds for the poor and the needy, but she has also committed serious errors that the Bible clearly points out in Daniel and in Revelation. God must sometimes chasten and rebuke because He wants us to be aware of error and compromise, and people who are truly loyal to Him will heed His warnings, no matter the faith. With this in mind, let’s examine each of the 11 characteristics: 1. It rises out of the sea. We previously learned that waters represent densely populated areas (Revelation 17:15), and since the papacy arose in Rome, Italy—a peninsula in the heart of Western Europe—it fits this point. 1. It is the composite of the four beasts of Daniel 7. The beast is the composite of these beasts (Daniel 7:4-7) because it incorporates various beliefs and practices from all four empires, and the papacy fits this point too. “In a certain respect, she [the papacy] has copied her organization from that of the Roman Empire, has preserved and made fruitful the philosophical intuitions of Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle, borrowed from both Barbarians and the Byzantine Roman Empire, but always remains herself, thoroughly digesting all elements drawn from external sources.” 1. The dragon gives it power and authority. The dragon can be identified by reading Revelation 12:1-6 where it talks about a pregnant woman about to deliver and the dragon hoping to devour the baby at birth; however, the child evades the dragon by being caught up to heaven. This is an obvious reference to Jesus, whom Herod tried to kill by slaying all the babies in Bethlehem (Matthew 2:16). Herod was acting under his authority as a king of Rome, so the dragon represents pagan Rome, but the real power behind Herod’s plot was the devil (Revelation 12:7-9) who likes to act through various governments to move his ugly work forward. The Roman Empire eventually fell in 476, and its power and capital city were inherited by the papacy. “The Roman Church … pushed itself into the place of the Roman World-Empire, of which it is the actual continuation. … The Pope … is Caesar’s successor.” “The mighty Catholic Church was little more than the Roman Empire baptised. Rome was transformed as well as converted. The very capital of the old Empire became the capital of the Christian Empire. The office of Pontifex Maximus was continued in that of Pope.” 1. It receives a deadly wound. This prophecy was fulfilled when Napoleon’s general, Alexander Berthier, took Pope Pius VI captive in 1798. When the pope died in 1799, “half Europe thought … that without the Pope the Papacy was dead.” 1. Its deadly wound is healed. The power and influence of the papacy has been increasing steadily over the years, and today she is not only one of the most powerful religious organizations in the world, but she has strong political influence as well. When the wound is completely healed, Revelation 13:3 says the entire world will give homage to it. 1. It becomes a strong political power. Revelation 13:7 says the papacy will have political power and influence over all of the nations of the world. The papacy’s political rise started when Italian dictator Benito Mussolini signed a treaty with the Vatican establishing it as a political state and protecting it from interference by the Italian government. Even though Vatican City is the smallest country in the world, it now has ambassadors (called “papal nuncios”) in every part of the globe. In 1984, it established diplomatic relations with the United States, and in 2015 Pope Francis spoke to a joint session of the U.S. Congress for the first time ever. No doubt, the wound has been healing. 1. It becomes a strong religious power. Revelation 13:8 says the papacy will be worshiped, which implies religious power and influence, by the entire world. Today the pope is respected by faiths across the religious spectrum. In 2014 Francis led an ecumenical worship service that was attended by Anglican, Lutheran, Methodist, and Orthodox representatives. He has also hosted a prayer summit at the Vatican with Israeli and Palesinian leaders. Cardinal Timothy Dolan had this to say: “The more he tries to de-emphasize the prestige and the power of the papacy, … the more people pay attention to him.” 1. It speaks blasphemy against God. Blasphemy is defined as claiming to forgive sins (Luke 5:21) and claiming to be God (John 10:33). The papacy fits these points because her priests claim to forgive sins and the popes claim to be Vicars of Christ. 1. It wars against the saints and overcomes them. The papacy persecuted and killed millions of people during the Dark Ages for following their conscience. 1. It rules for 42 months. The papacy ruled for 42 prophetic months, which equates to 1,260 years, from 538 to 1798. During this time the papacy had power to persecute and kill anyone who followed the Bible over its own traditions, and as a result, many had to flee their native countries or even escape into the wilderness. This was clearly foretold in Revelation 12:6, 14 and vividly fulfilled, for example, in the history of the Huguenots who fled France and the Waldensians who escaped into the Cottian Alps because they refused to compromise with the unbiblical teachings of the Roman Catholic Church. 1. It has the mysterious number of 666. Revelation 13:8 refers to it as “the number of a man,” and Revelation 15:2 says “the number of his name.” What is the official name of the pope? According to a Catholic quote: “The title of the pope of Rome is Vicarius Filii Dei.” The Douay versions of the Bible have a footnote for Revelation 13:8 that says, “The numeral letters of his name shall make up this number.” Notice that when the Roman numeral values of the letters of the pope’s official name are added up they equal 666 (note that V and U each equal five in Roman numerals). <br“|V|I|C|A|R|I|U|S| |F|I|L|I|I| |D|E|I| |-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-| |5|1|100|0|0|1|5|0| |0|1|50|1|1| |500|0|1| By the way, the Latin title “Vicarius Filii Dei” means “substitute of Son of God,” which is an echo of the word “antichrist,” which can be translated as “in place of God.” To summarize, there is no other power in history that could fit all 11 of these identifiers apart from the papacy, and only God could have prophesied this in advance.

What is God’s sign of authority? “Moreover also I gave them my sabbaths, to be a sign between me and them, that they might know that I am the LORD that sanctify them.” —Ezekiel 20:12 “Wherefore the children of Israel shall keep the sabbath, to observe the sabbath throughout their generations, for a perpetual covenant. It is a sign between me and the children of Israel for ever: for in six days the LORD made heaven and earth, and on the seventh day he rested, and was refreshed.” —Exodus 31:16-17 “Remember the sabbath day, to keep it holy. Six days shalt thou labour, and do all thy work: but the seventh day is the sabbath of the LORD thy God: in it thou shalt not do any work, thou, nor thy son, nor thy daughter, thy manservant, nor thy maidservant, nor thy cattle, nor thy stranger that is within thy gates. For in six days the LORD made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that in them is, and rested the seventh day: wherefore the LORD blessed the sabbath day, and hallowed it.” —Exodus 20:8-11 The fourth commandment about the Sabbath contains the three basic elements of a seal: the name (the Lord), title (your God), and territory (heaven and earth), so the seventh day Sabbath is a sign of God as the Creator of the universe, as well as the Sanctifier of those who choose to follow Him. It represents His authority to rule as Creator and Savior. Revelation 7:1-3 says that in the last days His servants will have the seal of God, the Sabbath, on their foreheads, which represents the mind (Hebrews 10:16), meaning they’ve made a decision to surrender their lives to Jesus—to follow Him as the authority over their lives because He created and saved them. Hebrews 4:4-10 says there remains a rest day for those who entered His rest (received salvation); this rest day is a symbol of salvation because we can stop trying to be saved by our works and rest in the righteousness of Jesus instead! The words seal, mark, sign, and token are used interchangeably in the Bible (Genesis 17:11; Ezekiel 9:4; Romans 4:11; Revelation 7:3). What does the papacy say is her mark of authority? Notice the following excerpts from Catholic catechisms: “Question: Have you any other way of proving that the Church has power to institute festivals of precept? Answer: Had she not such power, she could not have done that in which all modern religionists agree with her—she could not have substituted the observance of Sunday the first day of the week, for the observance of Saturday the seventh day, a change for which there is no Scriptural authority.” “Question: Why do we observe Sunday instead of Saturday? Answer: We observe Sunday instead of Saturday because the Catholic Church transferred the solemnity from Saturday to Sunday.” Here is another quote: “The church is above the Bible, and this transference of Sabbath observance is proof of that fact.” Cardinal Gibbons (a cardinal is a senior officer in the Catholic Church) had this to say about Sunday-keeping: “Of course the Catholic Church claims that the change was her act. It could not have been otherwise, as none in those days would have dreamed of doing anything, in matters spiritual, ecclesiastical and religious without her. This act is a mark of her ecclesiastical power and authority in religious matters.” The papacy itself is saying that it “changed” the Sabbath from Saturday to Sunday, the pagan day of sun worship, and virtually all churches accepted the new holy day. Therefore, it claims that this act is the mark of her power and authority. Stephen Keenan, A Doctrinal Catechism [FRS No. 7.], (3rd American ed., rev.: New York, Edward Dunigan & Bro., 1876), p. 174. Peter Geiermann, The Convert’s Catechism of Catholic Doctrine (St. Louis, B. Herder Book Co., 1957 ed.), p. 50. The Catholic Record (London, Ontario, Canada, Sept. 1, 1923). Extract from a letter written by the Chancellor of Cardinal Gibbons (November 11, 1895). Did God predict this attempted change? “And he shall speak great words against the most High, and shall wear out the saints of the most High, and think to change times and laws: and they shall be given into his hand until a time and times and the dividing of time.” —Daniel 7:25 We learned previously that one of the characteristics of the papacy would be trying to change times and laws. With regard to changing laws, in her catechisms she has removed the second commandment prohibiting the veneration of images, shortened the fourth commandment about the seventh Sabbath so that it could refer to any day, and divided the tenth commandment into two. Regarding changing times, she has attempted to change the time of the Sabbath from the seventh day to the first, as well as the timing of the Sabbath hours themselves—from sundown Friday night to sundown Saturday night as God commanded (Leviticus 23:32)) to the pagan Roman custom of counting the day from midnight to midnight. Of course, none of these changes are legitimate, because there is only one Lawgiver (James 4:12), and His word cannot change (Matthew 24:35). What question does the papacy asks Protestants? “You will tell me that Saturday was the Jewish Sabbath, but that the Christian Sabbath has been changed to Sunday. Changed! But by whom? Who has authority to change an express commandment of Almighty God? When God has spoken and said, Thou shalt keep holy the seventh day, who shall dare to say, Nay, thou mayest work and do all manner of worldly business on the seventh day; but thou shalt keep holy the first day in its stead? This is a most important question, which I know not how you can answer. “You are a Protestant, and you profess to go by the Bible and the Bible only; and yet in so important a matter as the observance of one day in seven as a holy day, you go against the plain letter of the Bible, and put another day in the place of that day which the Bible has commanded. The command to keep holy the seventh day is one of the Ten Commandments; you believe that the other nine are still binding; who gave you authority to tamper with the fourth? If you are consistent with your own principles, if you really follow the Bible and the Bible only, you ought to be able to produce some portion of the New Testament in which this fourth commandment is expressly altered.” “You may read the Bible from Genesis to Revelation, and you will not find a single line authorizing the sanctification of Sunday. The Scriptures enforce the religious observance of Saturday, a day which [Catholics] never sanctify.” Library of Christian Doctrine: Why Don’t You Keep Holy the Sabbath-Day? (London: Burns and Oates, Ltd.), pp. 3, 4. James Cardinal Gibbons, The Faith of Our Fathers, 93rd edition, 1917, p. 58. What warnings does God give regarding His law? “For the priest’s lips should keep knowledge, and they should seek the law at his mouth: for he is the messenger of the LORD of hosts. But ye are departed out of the way; ye have caused many to stumble at the law; ye have corrupted the covenant of Levi, saith the LORD of hosts. Therefore have I also made you contemptible and base before all the people, according as ye have not kept my ways, but have been partial in the law.” —Malachi 2:7-9 “That this is a rebellious people, lying children, children that will not hear the law of the LORD: which say to the seers, See not; and to the prophets, Prophesy not unto us right things, speak unto us smooth things, prophesy deceits.” —Isaiah 30:9-10 “The earth mourneth and fadeth away, the world languisheth and fadeth away, the haughty people of the earth do languish. The earth also is defiled under the inhabitants thereof; because they have transgressed the laws, changed the ordinance, broken the everlasting covenant. Therefore hath the curse devoured the earth, and they that dwell therein are desolate: therefore the inhabitants of the earth are burned, and few men left.” —Isaiah 24:4-6 “Her priests have violated my law, and have profaned mine holy things: they have put no difference between the holy and profane, neither have they shewed difference between the unclean and the clean, and have hid their eyes from my sabbaths, and I am profaned among them. … Therefore have I poured out mine indignation upon them; I have consumed them with the fire of my wrath: their own way have I recompensed upon their heads, saith the Lord GOD.” —Ezekiel 22:26, 31 God warns religious leaders who ignore His law and say that some commandments do not matter because such actions cause many people to stumble, but He also warns people who do not desire to learn about the law and want smooth fables to be preached, instead. Why? Because changing or refusing to follow God’s law has real consequences, including tragedy and upheaval on the earth. And this is not because God delights in heartache and misery, but because His law of love is there to protect from it. When it’s continually ignored, He will eventually stop pleading and let the consequences of rebellion play out. God cares about the truth being preached because He does not want anyone to be deceived, and so Ezekiel warns that those who teach there is no difference between sacred things, such as God’s holy day, and common things, such as Sunday, will one day face His indignation. Is the mark on the forehead visible? “And he causeth all, both small and great, rich and poor, free and bond, to receive a mark in their right hand, or in their foreheads.” —Revelation 13:16 “Therefore shall ye lay up these my words in your heart and in your soul, and bind them for a sign upon your hand, that they may be as frontlets between your eyes.” —Deuteronomy 11:18 “This is the covenant that I will make with them after those days, saith the Lord, I will put my laws into their hearts, and in their minds will I write them.” —Hebrews 10:16 “Whatsoever thy hand findeth to do, do it with thy might; for there is no work, nor device, nor knowledge, nor wisdom, in the grave, whither thou goest.” —Ecclesiastes 9:10 The forehead is the location of the frontal lobe, the area of the brain responsible for decision making, and in the Bible it represents the mind. When God told the Israelites to place His law on their foreheads He wanted the law to be in their minds. Likewise, the mark of the beast in the forehead (mind) is a decision to keep Sunday due to a conviction that it’s holy. Regarding being marked on the hand, in the Bible the hand represents work, so it’s accepting Sunday-keeping though one’s actions for practical reasons (convenience, job, family), not because of a conviction that it’s holy. In other words, the mark of the beast is a marking of oneself by accepting the beast’s mark, Sunday, either through conviction or actions, as opposed to God’s seal, the true seventh day Sabbath. Even though it’s not an obvious physical mark, God will know who has His seal and who has the beast’s mark (2 Timothy 2:19). Does anyone have the mark of the beast now? “And he causeth all, both small and great, rich and poor, free and bond, to receive a mark in their right hand, or in their foreheads: and that no man might buy or sell, save he that had the mark, or the name of the beast, or the number of his name.” —Revelation 13:16-17 No one will have the mark of the beast until Sunday worship is enforced by law. A time will come when the issue of Sunday worship will be so prominent that those who don’t go along will be cut off from the financial system, unable to buy or sell. When Sunday keeping is enforced by law that is when those who worship on the papacy’s counterfeit holy day will receive her mark, but those who follow Jesus and obey Him will worship on Satuday, His holy Sabbath day, and receive His mark. But waiting until the end to keep the true Sabbath is a mistake. Anyone who hopes to refuse the beasts’s mark in the future should keep Jesus’ true Sabbath now, and whoever decides to obey Him will receive His power to do so (Acts 5:32). Without Him, I can do nothing (John 15:5), but with Him all things are possible (Mark 10:27). What message does God give the world in the last days? “If thou turn away thy foot from the sabbath, from doing thy pleasure on my holy day; and call the sabbath a delight, the holy of the LORD, honourable; and shalt honour him, not doing thine own ways, nor finding thine own pleasure, nor speaking thine own words: then shalt thou delight thyself in the LORD; and I will cause thee to ride upon the high places of the earth, and feed thee with the heritage of Jacob thy father: for the mouth of the LORD hath spoken it.” —Isaiah 58:13-14 “Saying with a loud voice, Fear God, and give glory to him; for the hour of his judgment is come: and worship him that made heaven, and earth, and the sea, and the fountains of waters.” —Revelation 14:7 “And the third angel followed them, saying with a loud voice, If any man worship the beast and his image, and receive his mark in his forehead, or in his hand, the same shall drink of the wine of the wrath of God, which is poured out without mixture into the cup of his indignation; and he shall be tormented with fire and brimstone in the presence of the holy angels, and in the presence of the Lamb.” —Revelation 14:9-10 God is asking His people to stop trampling on His holy day so He can bless them; in fact, the Sabbath itself is a blessing and a delight to those who keep it. Obviously, it’s an important issue to God, so much so that the three-point message He gives to all the earth in the last days (Revelation 14:6-11) begins with a call to worship God, the Creator, and it’s then culminated by a prominent warning against worshiping the beast and receiving his mark because it will be a life-or-death issue. The conflict between God and Lucifer started in heaven over the issue of worship because Lucifer wanted to be worshiped like the Creator God, and it’s clear that worship will be central in the last days too. Will I worship the Creator God by observing His Sabbath or the beast by observing his counterfeit Sunday? Some may think it’s just a day, but it was also just a fruit that Adam and Eve ate in the garden of Eden. The day reveals the condition of the heart—either one that’s completely surrendered to Jesus or one that’s in rebellion against Him. What is the highest form of worship? “Know ye not, that to whom ye yield yourselves servants to obey, his servants ye are to whom ye obey; whether of sin unto death, or of obedience unto righteousness?” —Romans 6:16 “If ye love me, keep my commandments.” —John 14:15 “Here is the patience of the saints: here are they that keep the commandments of God, and the faith of Jesus.” —Revelation 14:12 The highest form worship is obedience; whom we obey is whom we worship and serve. Love for Jesus is made evident by a willingness to obey Him. The saints who refuse to worship the beast and receive his mark will do it only because of their deep love for Jesus, which will be clearly manifested in their obedience to His Sabbath day. Is it possible to worship God falsely? “Not everyone who says to Me, “Lord, Lord,” shall enter the kingdom of heaven, but he who does the will of My Father in heaven. Many will say to Me in that day, “Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied in Your name, cast out demons in Your name, and done many wonders in Your name?” And then I will declare to them, “I never knew you; depart from Me, you who practice lawlessness!”” —Matthew 7:21-23, NKJV “This people draweth nigh unto me with their mouth, and honoureth me with their lips; but their heart is far from me. But in vain they do worship me, teaching for doctrines the commandments of men.” —Matthew 15:8-9 “And he said unto them, Full well ye reject the commandment of God, that ye may keep your own tradition.” —Mark 7:9 “For as the body without the spirit is dead, so faith without works is dead also. People can claim to worship God, but their trampling of God’s law (lawlessness) will tell a different story because their deeds will be contrary to their profession. Any worship of God that elevates man-made laws above and contrary to the law of God is false worship, and it’s especially dangerous when this is propogated by a religious system. Now this isn’t anything new, or exclusive to Roman Catholicism, because the Jewish leaders of Jesus’ day were guilty of it too. Anyone, regardless of his or her faith, can fall into it, because the human heart is deceitful and hard to decipher (Jeremiah 17:9). That’s why James says that faith without works (obedience) is dead. While I’m not saved by my obedience (salvation is only by the righteousness of Jesus), obedience is evidence that I am saved, and it’s primarily evidence for me because God already knows the true condition of my heart (Psalm 139:23-24). Who did John see in God’s eternal kingdom? “Saying, Hurt not the earth, neither the sea, nor the trees, till we have sealed the servants of our God in their foreheads. And I heard the number of them which were sealed: and there were sealed an hundred and forty and four thousand of all the tribes of the children of Israel.” —Revelation 7:3-4 “And I saw as it were a sea of glass mingled with fire: and them that had gotten the victory over the beast, and over his image, and over his mark, and over the number of his name, stand on the sea of glass, having the harps of God.” —Revelation 15:2 “These are they which were not defiled with women; for they are virgins. These are they which follow the Lamb whithersoever he goeth. These were redeemed from among men, being the firstfruits unto God and to the Lamb.” —Revelation 14:4 Those who have refused the mark of the beast and have God’s seal, instead, will be in God’s eternal kingdom. Notice also that while the mark of the beast is either in the forehead or the hand, the seal of God is only placed in the forehead, meaning God is looking for allegiance only from those who are truly sincere in their worship of Him on His holy day. What does Jesus say about following Him? “And other sheep I have, which are not of this fold: them also I must bring, and they shall hear my voice; and there shall be one fold, and one shepherd. … My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me.” —John 10:16, 27 “Then spake Jesus again unto them, saying, I am the light of the world: he that followeth me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life.” —John 8:12 “Thy word is a lamp unto my feet, and a light unto my path.” —Psalm 119:105 Jesus has His people in all faiths, and when they learn about His truth, they will recognize His voice calling out to them and will follow Him, no matter the cost. It may be a difficult decision to make, but the promise from Jesus is that those who follow Him will be blessed with the eternal light of truth that brings fullness of life right now (John 10:10)! This is why Paul and Silas were able to sing praises to God while in prison for their faith (Acts 16:23-25); even though their feet were shackled and their backs lacerated, their souls were filled with the enduring joy that is found only in Jesus!\",\"series\":\"The Antichrist’s Mark\"},\"33\":{\"title\":\"1,000 Years of Peace\",\"url\":\"/prophecy/millennium/\",\"category\":\"Prophecy\",\"description\":\"Find out who stays behind and what happens on earth, as well as in heaven, during the millennium.\",\"body\":\"What did Jesus promise before ascending to heaven? “Let not your heart be troubled: ye believe in God, believe also in me. In my Father’s house are many mansions: if it were not so, I would have told you. I go to prepare a place for you. And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again, and receive you unto myself; that where I am, there ye may be also.” —John 14:1-3 “And when he had spoken these things, while they beheld, he was taken up; and a cloud received him out of their sight. And while they looked stedfastly toward heaven as he went up, behold, two men stood by them in white apparel; which also said, Ye men of Galilee, why stand ye gazing up into heaven? this same Jesus, which is taken up from you into heaven, shall so come in like manner as ye have seen him go into heaven.” —Acts 1:9-11 Jesus said He was going to heaven to prepare a place for His followers—promising that He would come again to take them to be with Him there. This promise was reaffirmed by the two angels who appeared to His disciples at His ascension. They said that Jesus would return in the same bodily and personal manner as they had seen Him go into heaven. What will happen during Jesus’ second coming? “For the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the archangel, and with the trump of God: and the dead in Christ shall rise first: then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air: and so shall we ever be with the Lord.” —1 Thessalonians 4:16-17 “I am he that liveth, and was dead; and, behold, I am alive for evermore, amen; and have the keys of hell and of death.” —Revelation 1:18 “And there were voices, and thunders, and lightnings; and there was a great earthquake, such as was not since men were upon the earth, so mighty an earthquake, and so great. And the great city was divided into three parts, and the cities of the nations fell: and great Babylon came in remembrance before God, to give unto her the cup of the wine of the fierceness of his wrath. And every island fled away, and the mountains were not found. And there fell upon men a great hail out of heaven, every stone about the weight of a talent: and men blasphemed God because of the plague of the hail; for the plague thereof was exceeding great.” —Revelation 16:18-21 Because Jesus conquered death, all who have accepted His great sacrifice on their behalf and have died in Him will be resurrected at His coming. Together with the righteous who remain alive, they will be taken up to live with Him in heaven, never to be separated from Him again. The earth, on the other hand, will be devastated by the most catastrophic earthquake and hailstorm since creation. Revelation says that the hailstones will each weigh about a talent—about 75 pounds—and that the earthquake will cause the islands and mountains to move out of their places. How will the lost experience His coming? “For the Lord thy God is a consuming fire, even a jealous God.” —Deuteronomy 4:24 “In flaming fire taking vengeance on them that know not God, and that obey not the gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ.” —2 Thessalonians 1:8 “And then shall that Wicked be revealed, whom the Lord shall consume with the spirit of his mouth, and shall destroy with the brightness of his coming: even him, whose coming is after the working of Satan with all power and signs and lying wonders, and with all deceivableness of unrighteousness in them that perish; because they received not the love of the truth, that they might be saved.” —2 Thessalonians 2:8-10 Because sin cannot exist in the presence of a holy God, the second coming will be a consuming fire to all who have rejected Jesus’ sacrifice on their behalf. Their rejection means they have never confessed their sins to Him, leaving Him unable to forgive and cover them with His perfect righteousness. As a result, they must bear the penalty for their sins themselves—the wages of which is death (Romans 6:23). How does Jesus cleanse us from sin? “How much more shall the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered himself without spot to God, purge your conscience from dead works to serve the living God?” —Hebrews 9:14 “When the Lord shall have washed away the filth of the daughters of Zion, and shall have purged the blood of Jerusalem from the midst thereof by the spirit of judgment, and by the spirit of burning.” —Isaiah 4:4 “And such were some of you: but ye are washed, but ye are sanctified, but ye are justified in the name of the Lord Jesus, and by the Spirit of our God.” —1 Corinthians 6:11 To reject Jesus is to reject the convictions of the Holy Spirit upon the mind, through whom He works to purge us from sin. This is why the two travelers to Emmaus felt their hearts “burning” with conviction after Jesus explained the Scriptures to them (Luke 24:32). It also explains why the Holy Spirit appeared in the form of fire when He came upon the apostles at Pentecost (Acts 2:3-4). Because the lost have rejected the promptings of the Holy Spirit, the second coming will bring destruction upon them, for Christ’s glorious holiness is a consuming fire to all whose sins have not already been purged by the indwelling presence of His Holy Spirit (Psalm 50:3-4). What happens to Satan at this time? “And I saw an angel come down from heaven, having the key of the bottomless pit and a great chain in his hand. And he laid hold on the dragon, that old serpent, which is the Devil, and Satan, and bound him a thousand years. And cast him into the bottomless pit, and shut him up, and set a seal upon him, that he should deceive the nations no more, till the thousand years should be fulfilled: and after that he must be loosed a little season. … And when the thousand years are expired, Satan shall be loosed out of his prison.” —Revelation 20:1-3, 7 The chain described here is a symbolic chain of circumstances, representing Satan’s confinement to the desolate earth, where he will have no one to tempt or deceive—for the saved will be in heaven, and the lost will be dead. For the first time since his rebellion in heaven, he will be completely deprived of his power—a condition that will last for a thousand years. It is noteworthy that the Greek word translated “bottomless pit” is abussos (abyss)—the same word used in Genesis 1:2 for “deep”. In other words, during this period, the earth will return to a chaotic, uninhabited state similar to its condition before Creation. Who else is bound with him? “For if God spared not the angels that sinned, but cast them down to hell, and delivered them into chains of darkness, to be reserved unto judgment.” —2 Peter 2:4 “And it shall come to pass in that day, that the LORD shall punish the host of the high ones that are on high, and the kings of the earth upon the earth. And they shall be gathered together, as prisoners are gathered in the pit, and shall be shut up in the prison, and after many days shall they be visited.” —Isaiah 24:21-22 The fallen angels under Satan’s command—whom he first persuaded, by deception, to join his rebellion against God in heaven—will also be confined to the desolate earth with him. They will have ample time to reflect on their actions as they behold the devastation surrounding them—a constant reminder of the woeful consequences their rebellion has brought. By the way, the parallels between Isaiah 24:21-22 and Revelation 20:1-3 are remarkable. Both passages use the words “pit” and “prison” and refer to an extended period of time: “when the thousand years are expired, Satan shall be loosed out of his prison,” and “after many days shall they be visited.” Together, they provide a textbook example of allowing Scripture to interpret itself, for the “many days” in Isaiah correspond to the thousand years in Revelation. What happens to the lost? “And the slain of the LORD shall be at that day from one end of the earth even unto the other end of the earth: they shall not be lamented, neither gathered, nor buried; they shall be dung upon the ground.” —Jeremiah 25:33 The brightness of Jesus’ coming—His glorious and holy presence—will destroy the lost, who will remain dead for the entire millennium. Contrary to the popular secret rapture theory, which teaches that the lost will have a second chance to repent, they will have no such opportunity—for they will be dead, and the door of mercy will have closed forever. What happens to planet Earth? “And the seventh angel poured out his vial into the air; and there came a great voice out of the temple of heaven, from the throne, saying, It is done. And there were voices, and thunders, and lightnings; and there was a great earthquake, such as was not since men were upon the earth, so mighty an earthquake, and so great. And the great city was divided into three parts, and the cities of the nations fell: and great Babylon came in remembrance before God, to give unto her the cup of the wine of the fierceness of his wrath. And every island fled away, and the mountains were not found. And there fell upon men a great hail out of heaven, every stone about the weight of a talent: and men blasphemed God because of the plague of the hail; for the plague thereof was exceeding great.” —Revelation 16:17-21 “Therefore I will shake the heavens, and the earth shall remove out of her place, in the wrath of the LORD of hosts, and in the day of his fierce anger.” —Isaiah 13:13 “I beheld the earth, and, lo, it was without form, and void; and the heavens, and they had no light. I beheld the mountains, and, lo, they trembled, and all the hills moved lightly. I beheld, and, lo, there was no man, and all the birds of the heavens were fled. I beheld, and, lo, the fruitful place was a wilderness, and all the cities thereof were broken down at the presence of the LORD, and by his fierce anger. For thus hath the LORD said, The whole land shall be desolate; yet will I not make a full end.” —Jeremiah 4:23-27 The destruction at Jesus’ second coming will return the earth to its original state—a dark, barren place, unsuitable for life (Genesis 1:2). The fact that the earth will actually be moved from its current position likely explains why the heavens will have no light. Will Christ establish an earthly millennium? “Jesus answered, My kingdom is not of this world: if my kingdom were of this world, then would my servants fight, that I should not be delivered to the Jews: but now is my kingdom not from hence.” —John 18:36 “And when he was demanded of the Pharisees, when the kingdom of God should come, he answered them and said, The kingdom of God cometh not with observation: neither shall they say, Lo here! or, lo there! for, behold, the kingdom of God is within you.” —Luke 17:21-21 “For when they shall say, Peace and safety; then sudden destruction cometh upon them, as travail upon a woman with child; and they shall not escape.” —1 Thessalonians 5:3 Scripture’s portrayal of the earth’s desolation shows that the belief in an earthly millennium following Christ’s return (known as dispensational premillennialism) is unbiblical. Another view, postmillennialism, holds that Christ will return after a millennial period in which Christianity prevails—particularly at the governmental level—throughout the world. This perspective is often embraced by Christian nationalists, but it too is unbiblical, for Christ declared that His kingdom is not of this world. In fact, when describing the end of the world, Jesus never spoke of a period of universal peace; after warning of nations in distress and people’s hearts failing from fear, He went directly to His coming in glory (Luke 21:25-27). A heavenly millennium, therefore, is the only view that is consistent with all of Scripture. What do the saved do in heaven? “And I saw thrones, and they sat upon them, and judgment was given unto them: and I saw the souls of them that were beheaded for the witness of Jesus, and for the word of God, and which had not worshipped the beast, neither his image, neither had received his mark upon their foreheads, or in their hands; and they lived and reigned with Christ a thousand years.” —Revelation 20:4 “Do ye not know that the saints shall judge the world? and if the world shall be judged by you, are ye unworthy to judge the smallest matters? Know ye not that we shall judge angels? how much more things that pertain to this life?” —1 Corinthians 6:2-3 “And after these things I heard a great voice of much people in heaven, saying, Alleluia; Salvation, and glory, and honour, and power, unto the Lord our God: for true and righteous are his judgments.” —Revelation 19:1-2 The saved from all ages will participate in the next phase of judgment, during which all their questions about God’s dealings with sin and sinners will be answered. They will not determine who is saved or lost, for God will have already decided that during the first phase; rather, they will review the cases of all who are lost—including Satan and his angels. Perhaps they will wonder why some people they expected to be there are missing, while others they did not expect are present. Maybe certain perplexing events or trying circumstances in their own lives caused them to question why God allowed these things to happen. To all of these perplexities—and more—God will provide perfectly satisfying answers, confirming the fairness of His judgment and motivating the redeemed to praise Him all the more for His infinite wisdom, love, and mercy. What happens at the end of the millennium? “And I John saw the holy city, new Jerusalem, coming down from God out of heaven, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband.” —Revelation 21:2 “And his feet shall stand in that day upon the mount of Olives, which is before Jerusalem on the east, and the mount of Olives shall cleave in the midst thereof toward the east and toward the west, and there shall be a very great valley; and half of the mountain shall remove toward the north, and half of it toward the south. … and the LORD my God shall come, and all the saints with thee. … And the LORD shall be king over all the earth: in that day shall there be one LORD, and his name one.” —Zechariah 14:4-5, 9 “But the rest of the dead lived not again until the thousand years were finished.” —Revelation 20:5 “Marvel not at this: for the hour is coming, in the which all that are in the graves shall hear his voice, and shall come forth; they that have done good, unto the resurrection of life; and they that have done evil, unto the resurrection of damnation.” —John 5:28-29 Once the second phase of the judgment concludes at the end of the 1,000 years, Jesus will return to earth for the third time, bringing with Him all the redeemed and the glorious New Jerusalem. He will then level the Mount of Olives, creating a vast plain on which the city will rest. At that time, the second resurrection will occur—this time of the lost from all ages. Just as the resurrection of the saved marked the beginning of the millennium, so the resurrection of the lost will mark its close. For the first time in history, all who have ever lived since the creation of Adam and Eve will be gathered together—a vast, numberless multitude—for the third and final phase of the judgment. What happens to Satan? “And when the thousand years are expired, Satan shall be loosed out of his prison.” —Revelation 20:7 After the second resurrection, Satan will once again be free to deceive and manipulate the newly resurrected lost. What happens next? “And shall go out to deceive the nations which are in the four quarters of the earth, Gog and Magog, to gather them together to battle: the number of whom is as the sand of the sea. And they went up on the breadth of the earth, and compassed the camp of the saints about, and the beloved city.” —Revelation 20:8-9 “And I saw a great white throne, and him that sat on it, from whose face the earth and the heaven fled away; and there was found no place for them. And I saw the dead, small and great, stand before God; and the books were opened: and another book was opened, which is the book of life: and the dead were judged out of those things which were written in the books, according to their works.” —Revelation 20:11-12 “For there is nothing covered, that shall not be revealed; neither hid, that shall not be known. Therefore whatsoever ye have spoken in darkness shall be heard in the light; and that which ye have spoken in the ear in closets shall be proclaimed upon the housetops.” —Luke 12:2-3 As the lost behold the glories of the New Jerusalem and realize that they are shut out of it, Satan succeeds in deceiving them one final time, persuading them to surround the city in a desperate attempt to capture it. After all, among the lost are great military leaders from every age—commanders who have never known defeat. But suddenly God’s throne appears, halting their attack and inaugurating the final phase of the judgment. The wicked will then see the record of their lives unfold before them and recognize that God did everything possible to draw them to Himself—to save them from their sins and prepare them to dwell in His holy presence. Yet they resisted Him, and without the sacrifice of Jesus covering their sins, they are left to bear the penalty for their own sins. How will they respond? “For it is written, As I live, saith the Lord, every knee shall bow to me, and every tongue shall confess to God.” —Romans 14:11 “That at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of things in heaven, and things in earth, and things under the earth; and that every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father.” —Philippians 2:10-11 All the lost—including Satan, the original instigator of the long rebellion against God’s government—and his angels bow before God in acknowledgment that He has been perfectly just yet merciful, fair yet loving. All present—the saved and the lost, the fallen and unfallen angels, and even Satan himself—realize there was no justification or excuse for sin, and their confession settles the great controversy between good and evil in the minds of all, bringing it to a close. The universe can now be safely cleansed of the virus of sin, including all who, regrettably, chose to persistently cling to it. What then happens to the lost? “And they went up on the breadth of the earth, and compassed the camp of the saints about, and the beloved city: and fire came down from God out of heaven, and devoured them. And the devil that deceived them was cast into the lake of fire and brimstone, where the beast and the false prophet are, and shall be tormented day and night for ever and ever.” —Revelation 20:9-10 “And death and hell were cast into the lake of fire. This is the second death. And whosoever was not found written in the book of life was cast into the lake of fire.” —Revelation 20:14-15 “Say unto them, As I live, saith the Lord GOD, I have no pleasure in the death of the wicked; but that the wicked turn from his way and live: turn ye, turn ye from your evil ways; for why will ye die, O house of Israel?” —Ezekiel 33:11 What follows next is an act in which God takes no pleasure: fire will begin to fall from heaven upon the lost, Satan, and his angels, forming a lake of fire all around the New Jerusalem. This is the second death, from which there is no resurrection. For the God of love (1 John 4:8), this will be a painful experience to endure, because every person destroyed is one whom He created and loved more deeply than any parent could love a child. He did everything possible to save them, but they persistently rejected Him, leaving Him no other choice. The time has come to eradicate sin, for it cannot continue to exist unchecked, perpetuating pain, misery, and death throughout eternity. The Bible does not specify how long the fire will burn, but eventually it will go out, and when it does, the universe will at last be free from sin—forever (Nahum 1:9). What happens once the fire goes out? “For, behold, I create new heavens and a new earth: and the former shall not be remembered, nor come into mind.” —Isaiah 65:17 “Nevertheless we, according to his promise, look for new heavens and a new earth, wherein dwelleth righteousness.” —2 Peter 3:13 “And I saw a new heaven and a new earth: for the first heaven and the first earth were passed away; and there was no more sea. … And I heard a great voice out of heaven saying, Behold, the tabernacle of God is with men, and he will dwell with them, and they shall be his people, and God himself shall be with them, and be their God. And God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes; and there shall be no more death, neither sorrow, nor crying, neither shall there be any more pain: for the former things are passed away.” —Revelation 21:1, 3-4 Once the last smoldering coal goes out, God will create a new heaven and a new earth—where righteousness dwells. Unlike the first creation, which no human eyes beheld, this second creation will be witnessed by all the redeemed. God will speak, and the barren earth will be transformed into a lush garden teeming with life (Psalm 33:6). Everything Adam and Eve lost—and more—will be restored, and the redeemed will live in the presence of God in perfect harmony, indescribable joy, and ever-deepening love for Him and for one another through the ceaseless ages of eternity.\",\"series\":\"The Second Coming\"},\"34\":{\"title\":\"The Gift of Prophecy\",\"url\":\"/prophecy/prophets/\",\"category\":\"Prophecy\",\"description\":\"False prophets are on the rise. Learn how to tell the difference between a false and a true prophet of God.\",\"body\":\"What is one way God speaks to us? “I have also spoken by the prophets, and I have multiplied visions, and used similitudes, by the ministry of the prophets.” —Hosea 12:10 “Surely the Lord GOD will do nothing, but he revealeth his secret unto his servants the prophets.” —Amos 3:7 “Remember the former things of old: for I am God, and there is none else; I am God, and there is none like me, declaring the end from the beginning, and from ancient times the things that are not yet done, saying, My counsel shall stand, and I will do all my pleasure.” —Isaiah 46:9-10 God has chosen to use prophets to speak to humanity on His behalf; they share His messages and make His will known. Before significant events unfold, God reveals His intentions to the world through them, so that the human family is warned and prepared. For example, He used Noah to warn the world about the flood (2 Peter 2:5), while Jeremiah warned Israel about their 70-year captivity in Babylon (Jeremiah 25:11). Regarding the coming of the Messiah, Isaiah announced that Jesus would would be born of a virgin (Isaiah 7:14), Micah said He would be born in Bethlehem (Micah 5:2), and Daniel prophesied that He would be “cut off” or killed (Daniel 9:26). Later, God used John the Baptist to announce that His coming was near (John 1:23-27). After Jesus’ ascension, Paul announced that Jesus would return a second time (1 Thessalonians 4:16-17), and given the importance of His return, we can expect the gift of prophecy to be evident again in the last days to warn and prepare the world. What did Jesus warn about prophets? “And many false prophets shall rise, and shall deceive many. And because iniquity shall abound, the love of many shall wax cold. … For there shall arise false Christs, and false prophets, and shall shew great signs and wonders; insomuch that, if it were possible, they shall deceive the very elect.” —Matthew 24:11, 24 Jesus said there will be many false prophets in the last days deceiving people with signs and wonders. The working of miracles, therefore, is not sufficient evidence of a genuine prophet (Revelation 13:13-14; 16:14). But it’s important to note that Jesus did not say that all prophets will be false ones. Since He warned about false ones, there must be genuine ones too. Which false prophets are condemned? “There shall not be found among you anyone who makes his son or his daughter pass through the fire, or one who practices witchcraft, or a soothsayer, or one who interprets omens, or a sorcerer, or one who conjures spells, or a medium, or a spiritist, or one who calls up the dead. For all who do these things are an abomination to the Lord, and because of these abominations the Lord your God drives them out from before you” —Deuteronomy 18:10-12, NKJV The Bible specifically names the following types of false prophets: - One who practices witchcraft (fortune teller) - Soothsayer (astrologer) - One who interprets omens (uses charms) - Sorcerer (claims to contact the spirits of the dead) - One who conjures spells - Medium (claims to channel the spirits of the dead) - Spiritist (claims to talk to the dead) - Witch (mentioned in KJV, a psychic) The Bible clearly teaches that the dead cannot be contacted, and any supposed communication with the dead is an abomination to God because such communication is actually with evil spirits masquerading as the dead). What else does the Bible say about prophets? “Wherefore he saith, When he ascended up on high, he led captivity captive, and gave gifts unto men. … And he gave some, apostles; and some, prophets; and some, evangelists; and some, pastors and teachers; for the perfecting of the saints, for the work of the ministry, for the edifying of the body of Christ: till we all come in the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of God, unto a perfect man, unto the measure of the stature of the fulness of Christ: that we henceforth be no more children, tossed to and fro, and carried about with every wind of doctrine, by the sleight of men, and cunning craftiness, whereby they lie in wait to deceive; but speaking the truth in love, may grow up into him in all things, which is the head, even Christ.” —Ephesians 4:8, 11-15 “Now ye are the body of Christ, and members in particular. And God hath set some in the church, first apostles, secondarily prophets, thirdly teachers, after that miracles, then gifts of healings, helps, governments, diversities of tongues.” —1 Corinthians 12:27-28 “Wherefore tongues are for a sign, not to them that believe, but to them that believe not: but prophesying serveth not for them that believe not, but for them which believe.” —1 Corinthians 14:22 While a prophet can at times edify the public, Paul tells us that prophecy is one of Jesus’ gifts to His church intended to edify its members in their Christian walk as well as to equip them in the work of ministry to others. These gifts are vital to His church and will remain with her until Jesus returns. But it’s also important to emphasize that while the gift of prophecy is a tremendous blessing, it’s not meant to add to, replace, or minimize the Word of God (Revelation 22:18-19; Proverbs 30:5-6). It’s true that God has used prophets to clarify His Word, but He never used them to originate new beliefs that cannot be supported by the Bible. The genuine gift of prophecy always elevates, and is in harmony with, God’s Word (Matthew 4:4). Why is the gift of prophecy absent from most churches? “Her gates are sunk into the ground; he hath destroyed and broken her bars: her king and her princes are among the Gentiles: the law is no more; her prophets also find no vision from the LORD.” —Lamentations 2:9 When God’s people knowingly rebel against His holy law, He withdraws the prophetic gift because the gifts of the Spirit are for those who genuinely desire to live a life of complete surrender to Him—a life that’s in harmony with and in obedience to His teachings, summarized in His law (Matthew 22:36-40). This principle explains why God sent a prophet once His remnant church emerged in the 1800s that kept, and still keeps, all of His commandments, including the seventh-day Sabbath observed by Jesus. God also knows exactly when His people are in need of warning, counsel, and guidance, and when that time comes, He lovingly sends them a prophet to strengthen them (Proverbs 29:18). Who empowers prophets to speak on God’s behalf? “But the manifestation of the Spirit is given to every man to profit withal. For to one is given by the Spirit the word of wisdom; to another the word of knowledge by the same Spirit; to another faith by the same Spirit; to another the gifts of healing by the same Spirit; to another the working of miracles; to another prophecy; to another discerning of spirits; to another divers kinds of tongues; to another the interpretation of tongues. But all these worketh that one and the selfsame Spirit, dividing to every man severally as he will.” —1 Corinthians 12:7-11 “Knowing this first, that no prophecy of the scripture is of any private interpretation. For the prophecy came not in old time by the will of man: but holy men of God spake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost.” —2 Peter 1:20-21 Jesus gives the gift of prophecy through the Holy Spirit, who distributes it to His people as He wills. In his second epistle, Peter tells us that it’s the Spirit who enables and empowers God’s prophets to speak on His behalf. Will the gift of prophecy be evident in the last days? “And it shall come to pass afterward, that I will pour out my spirit upon all flesh; and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, your old men shall dream dreams, your young men shall see visions. And also upon the servants and upon the handmaids in those days will I pour out my spirit.” —Joel 2:28-29 This prophecy was partially fulfilled when the Holy Spirit was poured out during Pentecost (Acts 2:1-4), empowering Jesus’ disciples to take the good news of His great sacrifice for sinners to the entire world. The prophecy will be fully fulfilled in the last days when the Holy Spirit empowers Christ’s followers to warn and prepare the world for His glorious return. Does the Bible give more evidence? “And the dragon was wroth with the woman, and went to make war with the remnant of her seed, which keep the commandments of God, and have the testimony of Jesus Christ.” —Revelation 12:17 “And I fell at his feet to worship him. And he said unto me, See thou do it not: I am thy fellowservant, and of thy brethren that have the testimony of Jesus: worship God: for the testimony of Jesus is the spirit of prophecy.” —Revelation 19:10 The remnant of Revelation 12 is God’s church in the last days, and it has two characteristics: keeps God’s commandments and has the testimony of Jesus Christ, which, according to Revelation 19, is the spirit of prophecy. This is another clue that the gift of prophecy will be evident in the last days prior to Jesus’ return; in fact, it’s one of the identifying marks of the remnant church. Paul confirms this in 1 Corinthians 1:4-7 where he says that the church waiting for His return will not lack any of the gifts of the Spirit. Just as God sent John the Baptist to prepare the world for Jesus’ first coming, He will send the gift of prophecy to His last-day commandment-keeping church to prepare the world (and itself) for Jesus’ second coming. Incidentally, since the testimony of Jesus is the spirit of prophecy then the words of His prophets are special messages from Jesus to us. Bringing reproach upon His prophets is the same as bringing reproach upon Jesus because He is the One who sends them. What else does the Bible say about the gift of prophecy? “And they rose early in the morning, and went forth into the wilderness of Tekoa: and as they went forth, Jehoshaphat stood and said, Hear me, O Judah, and ye inhabitants of Jerusalem; believe in the LORD your God, so shall ye be established; believe his prophets, so shall ye prosper.” —2 Chronicles 20:20 “Quench not the Spirit. Despise not prophesyings. Prove all things; hold fast that which is good. Abstain from all appearance of evil.” —1 Thessalonians 5:19-22 God has urged His people not to despise the gift of prophecy; in fact, He has pronounced a blessing on those who believe the words of His prophets. In an echo of Jesus’ warning about false prophets, Paul also tells us to test all things so that we can accurately discern whether a prophet is genuine or false. How does God speak to His prophets? “And he said, Hear now my words: If there be a prophet among you, I the LORD will make myself known unto him in a vision, and will speak unto him in a dream.” —Numbers 12:6 “I speak with him face to face, Even plainly, and not in dark sayings; And he sees the form of the LORD. Why then were you not afraid To speak against My servant Moses?”” —Numbers 12:8, NKJV God speaks to His prophets through visions, dreams, and face to face. What is a characteristic of a true prophet? “And, behold, one like the similitude of the sons of men touched my lips: then I opened my mouth, and spake, and said unto him that stood before me, O my lord, by the vision my sorrows are turned upon me, and I have retained no strength. For how can the servant of this my lord talk with this my lord? for as for me, straightway there remained no strength in me, neither is there breath left in me. Then there came again and touched me one like the appearance of a man, and he strengthened me, and said, O man greatly beloved, fear not: peace be unto thee, be strong, yea, be strong. And when he had spoken unto me, I was strengthened, and said, Let my lord speak; for thou hast strengthened me.” —Daniel 10:16-19 “He hath said, which heard the words of God, which saw the vision of the Almighty, falling into a trance, but having his eyes open.” —Numbers 24:4 “It is not expedient for me doubtless to glory. I will come to visions and revelations of the Lord. I knew a man in Christ above fourteen years ago, (whether in the body, I cannot tell; or whether out of the body, I cannot tell: God knoweth;) such an one caught up to the third heaven. And I knew such a man, (whether in the body, or out of the body, I cannot tell: God knoweth;) How that he was caught up into paradise, and heard unspeakable words, which it is not lawful for a man to utter.” —2 Corinthians 12:1-4 During a vision from God the true prophet will have the following physical characteristics, although they may not be present all at once: - Initially losing physical strength (Daniel 10:17). - Later receiving supernatural strength (Daniel 10:18-19). - No breath in the body (Daniel 10:17). - Able to speak (Daniel 10:17). - Eyes wide open (Numbers 24:4). - Not being aware of earthly surroundings (2 Corinthians 12:1-4). What is another characteristic? “Also I heard the voice of the Lord, saying, Whom shall I send, and who will go for us? Then said I, Here am I; send me. And he said, Go, and tell this people, Hear ye indeed, but understand not; and see ye indeed, but perceive not.” —Isaiah 6:8-9 “Then the word of the LORD came unto me, saying, Before I formed thee in the belly I knew thee; and before thou camest forth out of the womb I sanctified thee, and I ordained thee a prophet unto the nations. Then said I, Ah, Lord GOD! behold, I cannot speak: for I am a child. But the LORD said unto me, Say not, I am a child: for thou shalt go to all that I shall send thee, and whatsoever I command thee thou shalt speak.” —Jeremiah 1:4-7 “Then answered Amos, and said to Amaziah, I was no prophet, neither was I a prophet’s son; but I was an herdman, and a gatherer of sycomore fruit: and the LORD took me as I followed the flock, and the LORD said unto me, Go, prophesy unto my people Israel.” —Amos 7:14-15 A genuine prophet is called to service by God. What is the third characteristic? “If there arise among you a prophet, or a dreamer of dreams, and giveth thee a sign or a wonder, and the sign or the wonder come to pass, whereof he spake unto thee, saying, Let us go after other gods, which thou hast not known, and let us serve them; thou shalt not hearken unto the words of that prophet, or that dreamer of dreams: for the LORD your God proveth you, to know whether ye love the LORD your God with all your heart and with all your soul. Ye shall walk after the LORD your God, and fear him, and keep his commandments, and obey his voice, and ye shall serve him, and cleave unto him.” —Deuteronomy 13:1-4 “And when they shall say unto you, Seek unto them that have familiar spirits, and unto wizards that peep, and that mutter: should not a people seek unto their God? for the living to the dead? To the law and to the testimony: if they speak not according to this word, it is because there is no light in them.” —Isaiah 8:19-20 The true prophet will always speak in harmony with and obedience to God’s will as revealed in His Word and in His commandments. Anyone speaking contrary to God’s will cannot be His prophet. What is the fourth characteristic? “The prophets that have been before me and before thee of old prophesied both against many countries, and against great kingdoms, of war, and of evil, and of pestilence. The prophet which prophesieth of peace, when the word of the prophet shall come to pass, then shall the prophet be known, that the LORD hath truly sent him.” —Jeremiah 28:8-9 The genuine prophet’s predictions always come to pass if they are not conditional. What is the fifth characteristic? “Beware of false prophets, which come to you in sheep’s clothing, but inwardly they are ravening wolves. Ye shall know them by their fruits. Do men gather grapes of thorns, or figs of thistles?” —Matthew 7:15-16 The life of a genuine prophet will reveal the character of Jesus and the fruits of the Spirit (Galatians 5:22-23). What is the final characteristic? “Beloved, believe not every spirit, but try the spirits whether they are of God: because many false prophets are gone out into the world. Hereby know ye the Spirit of God: every spirit that confesseth that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh is of God, and every spirit that confesseth not that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh is not of God: and this is that spirit of antichrist, whereof ye have heard that it should come; and even now already is it in the world.” —1 John 4:1-3 “And I, if I be lifted up from the earth, will draw all men unto me.” —John 12:32 The true prophet will lift up Jesus Christ and emphasize His centrality in all teachings because it’s His love that draws people to Himself. Anyone who denies Jesus’ atoning sacrifice on the cross as being sufficient to pay for all sins is not from God. How is the gift of prophecy manifested in the last days? In question eight we learned that the gift of prophecy will be evident in God’s remnant church, which emerged in the mid-1800s. In order to encourage the growing church, God called a young woman named Ellen Harmon, who later married and became Ellen White, and blessed her with the gift of prophecy, using her to instruct the church as it grew into a worldwide missionary movement. Her life, visions, and writings fulfilled every biblical test of a genuine prophet, and they are evidence that God is doing everything He can to ensure His people have all the encouragement they need in order to thrive in the closing moments of Earth’s history. Even though Ellen had little formal education, she went on to write dozens of books on a variety of subjects, including the Bible, health, education, parenting, Christian living, evangelism, and more. Her writing is so impactful that she has become the fourth most translated author of all time. Her book on having a saving relationship with Jesus, Steps to Christ, has been translated into more than 165 languages. The best way to get acquainted with her prophetic gift is to read her material for yourself, and it will become evident that her primary goal was to direct people to Jesus as their personal Savior and to the Bible as their only rule of faith and life. Some of her other popular works include a book about the conflict between good and evil called The Great Controversy, one about Christ’s famous sermon called Thoughts From the Mount of Blessing, a book about His parables called Christ’s Object Lessons, and a masterpiece about His life called The Desire of Ages. Her writings are saturated with references to the Bible, which is elevated at every opportunity and never contradicted. Many who have read her works have been greatly blessed, realizing that she was used by God to communicate His love and truth, thereby leading many into a closer relationship with Him. It could be you if you give her writings a try.\",\"series\":\"A Prophetic Movement\"},\"35\":{\"title\":\"God’s Remnant Church\",\"url\":\"/prophecy/remnant/\",\"category\":\"Prophecy\",\"description\":\"God has a remnant church that will remain loyal to Him till the end. What are its identifying marks?\",\"body\":\"Jesus established His church upon what foundation? “And I say also unto thee, That thou art Peter, and upon this rock I will build my church; and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it.” —Matthew 16:18 “And did all drink the same spiritual drink: for they drank of that spiritual Rock that followed them: and that Rock was Christ.” —1 Corinthians 10:4 “For other foundation can no man lay than that is laid, which is Jesus Christ.” —1 Corinthians 3:11 “For the husband is the head of the wife, even as Christ is the head of the church: and he is the saviour of the body.” —Ephesians 5:23 Jesus established His church upon Himself—the Rock (Psalm 62:6). Paul makes it clear that Jesus is also the foundation as well as the head of the church. Moreover, He is the only Mediator between God and man (1 Timothy 2:5). The word used for Peter in Matthew 16:18 is “Petros,” which refers to a stone that can be moved around. Peter was a mere man who later ended up denying Christ (Matthew 26:69-75) and was rebuked by Paul (Galatians 2:11), so he could not be the foundation of the church. The word for “Rock” in Matthew 16:18 is “petra,” which refers to an immovable mass of rock—a solid foundation—Jesus Christ Himself (Ephesians 2:19-22; 1 Peter 2:5-7). Was there a church after His ascension? “Praising God, and having favour with all the people. And the Lord added to the church daily such as should be saved.” —Acts 2:47 “Then had the churches rest throughout all Judaea and Galilee and Samaria, and were edified; and walking in the fear of the Lord, and in the comfort of the Holy Ghost, were multiplied.” —Acts 9:31 “Not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together, as the manner of some is; but exhorting one another: and so much the more, as ye see the day approaching.” —Hebrews 10:25 After Jesus ascended to heaven, the church He established multiplied as it shared the truths it received from Christ with the world. Though it did not have an official denominational name, it was described as the body of Christ (Colossians 1:18). It was organized and included deacons, elders, and missionaries (1 Timothy 3:8-13; Titus 1:5-9; Acts 13:4-5). Paul encouraged believers to attend church—a practice that’s in harmony with the example set by Jesus Himself, who faithfully attended church every Sabbath (Luke 4:16). Attending church offers opportunities to encourage others, brings the blessings of community, enables the gospel to be shared more effectively, and enhances one’s own spiritual journey. How did Paul describe the church? “But if I tarry long, that thou mayest know how thou oughtest to behave thyself in the house of God, which is the church of the living God, the pillar and ground of the truth.” —1 Timothy 3:15 God’s church was characterized by a commitment to the truth taught by Jesus, not manmade traditions, customs, or doctrines. But Paul also warned about apostasy coming in that would lead to a falling away from the church Jesus established (2 Thessalonians 2:3), which occured roughly 300 years after the establishment of Christianity when pagan customs and teachings started to make inroads. How does Revelation describe God’s church in the last days? “And there appeared a great wonder in heaven; a woman clothed with the sun, and the moon under her feet, and upon her head a crown of twelve stars.” —Revelation 12:1 We learned in the previous lesson that a woman represents a church. A harlot represents an apostate church, while a pure woman represents God’s true church—the bride of Christ (Revelation 19:7-8; 2 Corinthians 11:2). In Revelation 12:1 we see a woman in stark contrast to the harlot of Revelation 17. She is clothed with the sun, which symbolizes Jesus and His righteousness (Psalm 84:11; Malachi 4:2), without which there is no salvation (Acts 4:12). This imagery illustrates Jesus’ desire for the church to radiate His glory to the world. The woman also has a moon under her feet, which has no light of its own, but reflects the light of the sun. This represents the sacrificial system of the Old Testament, which reflected the light of the Messiah to come (Hebrews 10:1). Her crown of 12 stars represents the work of the 12 disciples that crowned, or laid the foundation of, the New Testament church. What happens to the woman? “And she being with child cried, travailing in birth, and pained to be delivered. And there appeared another wonder in heaven; and behold a great red dragon, having seven heads and ten horns, and seven crowns upon his heads. And his tail drew the third part of the stars of heaven, and did cast them to the earth: and the dragon stood before the woman which was ready to be delivered, for to devour her child as soon as it was born. And she brought forth a man child, who was to rule all nations with a rod of iron: and her child was caught up unto God, and to his throne.” —Revelation 12:2-5 The woman is about to deliver a baby, representing Jesus, who would one day rule all nations with a rod of iron—a reference to Revelation 2:27 and Revelation 19:13-15, which points to Jesus coming to the defense of His people when He returns the second time. There’s a red dragon who tries to devour the baby as soon as it’s born, but it escapes and is caught up to God’s throne—a reference to Jesus’ ascension to heaven. The dragon represents Satan, working through pagan Rome, trying to kill Jesus at His birth through Herod’s decree to kill all the babies of Bethlehem (Matthew 2:16). What do the seven heads and ten horns represent? “And here is the mind which hath wisdom. The seven heads are seven mountains, on which the woman sitteth.” —Revelation 17:9 “And the ten horns out of this kingdom are ten kings that shall arise: and another shall rise after them; and he shall be diverse from the first, and he shall subdue three kings.” —Daniel 7:24 The dragon’s seven heads represent the seven hills of Rome, while the ten horns represent the 10 barbarian tribes that arose after the fall of the Roman Empire (Daniel 7:23-24) and eventually became the nations of modern Europe. Ultimately, the dragon represents Satan—working not just through pagan Rome, but the 10 nations that arose out of it—persecuting God’s people. It refers to the time Christians were persecuted by the Roman Empire after Christ’s ascension as well as the European nations cooperating with the papacy’s persecution during the Dark Ages. In the last days, the ten horns represent all the nations of the world aligning with spiritual Babylon in its fight against God’s followers (Revelation 16:14; 17:12-13). The reference to a third of the stars of heaven being cast down to earth points to the angels who supported Lucifer during his rebellion against God and were subsequently cast out of heaven (Revelation 12:9; Luke 10:18; Isaiah 14:12). What happens next? “And when the dragon saw that he was cast unto the earth, he persecuted the woman which brought forth the man child. And to the woman were given two wings of a great eagle, that she might fly into the wilderness, into her place, where she is nourished for a time, and times, and half a time, from the face of the serpent.” —Revelation 12:13 “And the woman fled into the wilderness, where she hath a place prepared of God, that they should feed her there a thousand two hundred and threescore days.” —Revelation 12:6 Once Satan was no longer able to attack Jesus personally, he shifted his focus to persecuting God’s church. He first used the Roman Empire to persecute her, but later he switched to apostasy, which led to a split (falling away). He then started working through the apostate Christian church to resume his persecution against the faithful church, but she was given wings, representing God’s protection (Exodus 19:4; Deuteronomy 32:11), so she could escape into the wilderness where she could preserve and live out God’s truths for “a time and times and half a time,” which is three and a half prophetic years or 1,260 literal years. Satan began working through papal Rome at this time. (Note that the time spent in the wilderness matches the 1,260 year period of papal dominance—538 to 1798.) The wilderness refers to solitary places (mountains, caves, forests, deserts, etc.) where God’s church could hide to escape being totally destroyed (Hebrews 11:37-38). The history and persecution of the Waldenses, Albigenses, and Huguenots, among many others, testifies to this reality. Millions died for their faith at the hands of the papacy, but God did not allow His church to be totally obliterated because the truth had to be preserved. God ensured that the doctrines of the apostolic church, which had entered this period of hiding, were preserved when the persecuted church came out of hiding. What does God call His end-time church? “And the dragon was wroth with the woman, and went to make war with the remnant of her seed, which keep the commandments of God, and have the testimony of Jesus Christ.” —Revelation 12:17 “Here is the patience of the saints: here are they that keep the commandments of God, and the faith of Jesus.” —Revelation 14:12 The word “remnant” refers to the last remaining portion of something, so in reference to God’s church, it points to His church in the last days. This church is then given two characteristics: she keeps the commandments of God, including the seventh-day Sabbath of the fourth commandment (John 14:15; Revelation 22:14), and has the testimony of Jesus, which is the spirit of prophecy (Revelation 19:10). Revelation 12:17 is an echo of Revelation 14:12, so the “testimony of Jesus Christ” can also refer to the faith and teachings of Jesus. Just as the remnant of a cloth has the same color and pattern as the original, the remnant church will return to the truths taught by Christ and believed by the original Christian church He established. Furthermore, in the previous question we learned that God’s church went into hiding from the year 538 to 1798, so even though the church was still alive, it did not exist as an official organization during that time. In other words, God’s last day, remnant church had to arise after 1798, but the process started during the great Protestant Reformation, which led to the Bible being translated into the common language so it could be read by all. Once that happened, the light of the gospel began to shine, and it would not be stopped—“the gates of hell shall not prevail against it” (Matthew 16:18). Is there anything else about the remnant church? “And I saw another angel fly in the midst of heaven, having the everlasting gospel to preach unto them that dwell on the earth, and to every nation, and kindred, and tongue, and people, Saying with a loud voice, Fear God, and give glory to him; for the hour of his judgment is come: and worship him that made heaven, and earth, and the sea, and the fountains of waters. And there followed another angel, saying, Babylon is fallen, is fallen, that great city, because she made all nations drink of the wine of the wrath of her fornication. And the third angel followed them, saying with a loud voice, If any man worship the beast and his image, and receive his mark in his forehead, or in his hand, the same shall drink of the wine of the wrath of God, which is poured out without mixture into the cup of his indignation; and he shall be tormented with fire and brimstone in the presence of the holy angels, and in the presence of the Lamb: and the smoke of their torment ascendeth up for ever and ever: and they have no rest day nor night, who worship the beast and his image, and whosoever receiveth the mark of his name. Here is the patience of the saints: here are they that keep the commandments of God, and the faith of Jesus.” —Revelation 14:6-12 The spirit of the Reformation continued through the centuries, leading to the establishment of God’s remnant that returned back to the teachings of the original church established by Jesus. This remnant church then preaches a three-point message, symbolized by the three angels of Revelation 14, that goes out to the entire world: 1. The first message calls people to fear God, which is an echo of Ecclesiastes 12:13-14 and a call to live a life of reverence for God that leads to keeping His commandments. It then calls people to give glory to Him, which is an echo of 1 Corinthians 10:31 and a call to live a life that glorifies Him in everything, including diet. The first message also announces that God’s judgment has already begun, and it calls people to worship Him as Creator (Revelation 4:11). This call to worship quotes the fourth commandment (Exodus 20:8-11), which identifies God as the Creator (Genesis 2:1-3) and invites people to worship Him as Creator by keeping His seventh-day Sabbath holy. 1. The second message calls people to come out of the fallen churches of spiritual Babylon. 1. The third message warns against worshiping the beast or receiving his mark, which is the observance of the papal Sunday in place of God’s true seventh-day Sabbath. Because this three-point message goes to the entire world, the remnant church must be a worldwide missionary church that preaches this three-point message. With the addition of the previously identified clues, we now have the following list of characteristics regarding the remnant church: 1. It would arise after 1798. 1. It would believe all the teachings of Jesus. 1. It would have the spirit of prophecy. 1. It would keep the commandments of God, including His seventh-day Sabbath. 1. It would be a worldwide missionary church. 1. It would be preaching the three angels’ messages of Revelation 14. How many churches fit these characteristics? “There is one body, and one Spirit, even as ye are called in one hope of your calling; one Lord, one faith, one baptism; one God and Father of all, who is above all, and through all, and in you all.” —Ephesians 4:4-6 “And other sheep I have, which are not of this fold: them also I must bring, and they shall hear my voice; and there shall be one fold, and one shepherd.” —John 10:16 The six characteristics above are specific enough that they fit only one church—the Seventh-day Adventist Church. Founded in 1863, it was born out of a desire to follow Jesus in accordance with the Bible alone; in this regard, it was a product and a continuation of the work of the Reformers. Being the only global organization preaching the three angels’ messages of Revelation 14, it’s committed to sharing the gospel of Jesus with the entire world. Moreover, according to Paul, God has one body of believers, not a multitude of churches that often present contradictory messages leading to confusion. He has His people in other churches, no doubt, which is why He’s calling them out (Revelation 18:4) and seeking to bring all of His followers together into His final church of the last days—into a unity that is based on the truths of His Word. The Greek word for “church” is “ekklesia,” and it literally means “called-out ones.” Just like there was only one way of escape in the time of Noah—the ark, Jesus has provided another kind of ark, the church, the pillar of truth (1 Timothy 3:15), to take His people safely through the closing moments of earth, and it’s absolutely crucial for every believer to be convinced, based on the Bible, that the church one attends meets the biblical criteria of God’s remnant church. What about the hypocrites in the church? “But go ye and learn what that meaneth, I will have mercy, and not sacrifice: for I am not come to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance.” —Matthew 9:13 “Husbands, love your wives, even as Christ also loved the church, and gave himself for it.” —Ephesians 5:25 The church is made of people, and people are not perfect. The church is more of a hospital for broken people whom Christ wants to heal and restore into His image. We are also called to be followers of Christ, not other Christians. Staying out of the church because of others was not what Jesus did. He faithfully attended church even though it was far from perfect, and despite the imperfect people there, Paul tells us that Jesus loves His church so much that He died for her (Ephesians 5:25). At the same time, Satan has not ceased his attack on God’s remnant church; he has just changed his tactics—from outright persecution in times past to a subtler strategy that is more inline with modern times, like discrediting her by spreading lies, but such actions are the very fulfillment of Revelation 12:17. To what kind of church does Jesus return? “That he might present it to himself a glorious church, not having spot, or wrinkle, or any such thing; but that it should be holy and without blemish.” —Ephesians 5:27 “But if I tarry long, that thou mayest know how thou oughtest to behave thyself in the house of God, which is the church of the living God, the pillar and ground of the truth.” —1 Timothy 3:15 “Here is the patience of the saints: here are they that keep the commandments of God, and the faith of Jesus.” —Revelation 14:12 “For this is the love of God, that we keep His commandments. And His commandments are not burdensome.” —1 John 5:3 The good news is that Jesus returns to a glorious church built on and in harmony with Bible truth, made up of faithful followers who refuse and separate from pagan teachings and traditions. They are known for their love of, loyalty to, and faith in Jesus, which is made evident in their obedience to His commandments. What invitation does the bride of Revelation give? “And the Spirit and the bride say, Come. And let him that heareth say, Come. And let him that is athirst come. And whosoever will, let him take the water of life freely.” —Revelation 22:17 In the last days everybody will be worshiping. Very soon there will be only two religions in the world: one worshiping and obeying Jesus and the other worshiping and obeying the dictates of man. Now is the time to follow Jesus’ call to come and be a part of His remnant church, of which He is the head (Colossians 1:18), to drink His eternal, life-giving truths, as revealed in His Word, and join in sharing His final message with the world.\",\"series\":\"A Prophetic Movement\"},\"36\":{\"title\":\"Signs of Christ’s Coming\",\"url\":\"/prophecy/signs/\",\"category\":\"Prophecy\",\"description\":\"How close are we to the most glorious event in earth’s history? Do you know the signs?\",\"body\":\"What is the first sign Jesus mentions? “And as he sat upon the mount of Olives, the disciples came unto him privately, saying, Tell us, when shall these things be? and what shall be the sign of thy coming, and of the end of the world? And Jesus answered and said unto them, Take heed that no man deceive you. For many shall come in my name, saying, I am Christ; and shall deceive many.” —Matthew 24:3-5 “For there shall arise false Christs, and false prophets, and shall shew great signs and wonders; insomuch that, if it were possible, they shall deceive the very elect.” —Matthew 24:24 “For such are false apostles, deceitful workers, transforming themselves into the apostles of Christ. And no marvel; for Satan himself is transformed into an angel of light.” —2 Corinthians 11:13-14 Jesus emphasizes that deception will not only be prevalent in the lead-up to His coming, but also powerful, as it will be accompanied by signs and wonders. Beyond people claiming to be false Christs, Satan himself can appear as an angel of light. Jim Jones and David Koresh are examples of false prophets who claimed to be Christ, but the danger runs even deeper than that. Over the past few decades, the New Age teachings of pantheism (all is God) and panentheism (God is in all) have been creeping into Christianity, leading some to believe that they are actually god. These teachings build upon the serpent’s original lie, “ye shall be as gods” (Genesis 3:5), and fulfill Christ’s prophecy that many would say, “I am Christ” (Matthew 24:5). Anyone who teaches that a human being can become god—or even Christ—spreads deception, because the truth is Jesus never promised us deity. He promised us eternal life (Romans 6:23), yes, but never deity. We are and will always be His created beings; He is our Creator God. Will there be a rise in skepticism? “Knowing this first, that there shall come in the last days scoffers, walking after their own lusts, and saying, Where is the promise of his coming? for since the fathers fell asleep, all things continue as they were from the beginning of the creation. For this they willingly are ignorant of, that by the word of God the heavens were of old, and the earth standing out of the water and in the water: whereby the world that then was, being overflowed with water, perished.” —2 Peter 3:3-6 “For the time will come when they will not endure sound doctrine; but after their own lusts shall they heap to themselves teachers, having itching ears; and they shall turn away their ears from the truth, and shall be turned unto fables.” —2 Timothy 4:3-4 It is incredible how Paul, after mentioning scoffers, goes back to the Genesis account—specifically the creation week, which identifies God as the Creator of the world, and the worldwide flood. A denial of both of these accounts lays the foundation for many false but widely held views today, such as Darwinian evolution, progressive creationism, and atheism. Perhaps the clearest example of the fulfillment of these verses, however, is the rise of higher criticism, which denies that the Bible is a divinely inspired book altogether. Efforts to undermine the authority of the Bible are alive in Christian churches too. Proponents of mysticism, for example, emphasize a subjective, experiential Christianity over one that is based on the objective and authoritative Word of God. This is a modern equivalent of another effort to undermine Scripture that reaches back thousands of years: the elevation of church tradition above Scripture, which, incidentally, was one of the rallying cries of the Reformation—sola scriptura (“Scripture alone”). What about spiritism? “Now the Spirit speaketh expressly, that in the latter times some shall depart from the faith, giving heed to seducing spirits, and doctrines of devils.” —1 Timothy 4:1 The interest in psychics, mediums, witchcraft, and the occult is as old as time, but it will intensify in the final days of earth’s history. Surprisingly, these practices are alive in Christianity as well through the meditative techniques of spiritual formation, which allegedly enable the practitioner to come into God’s presence—and even hear His voice—on demand. This is achieved through an altered state of consciousness, known as “entering the silence,” in which all thinking is suppressed, resulting in a trance-like, meditative state—the same state that witches, psychics, and channelers enter when they do their work. When this state is reached, the mind is opened to the influence of evil supernatural forces. The truth is God never asks us to suspend our reasoning powers when we pray or study His Word; on the contrary, He wants us to be fully engaged (Isaiah 1:18). (For more information, see Howard Peth’s book The Dangers of Contemplative Prayer.) What is another sign? “And ye shall hear of wars and rumours of wars: see that ye be not troubled: for all these things must come to pass, but the end is not yet. For nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom: and there shall be famines, and pestilences, and earthquakes, in divers places.” —Matthew 24:6-7 “All these are the beginning of birth pains.” —Matthew 24:8, NIV While wars, rumors of wars, famines, epidemics, and earthquakes have always existed, Jesus likened them to birth pains—which increase in frequency and intensity over time—to emphasize that these signs will follow the same pattern. Is there a surprising sign in Revelation? “And the nations were angry, and thy wrath is come, and the time of the dead, that they should be judged, and that thou shouldest give reward unto thy servants the prophets, and to the saints, and them that fear thy name, small and great; and shouldest destroy them which destroy the earth.” —Revelation 11:18 Humanity now possesses the power to destroy the earth—through weapons of mass destruction like the atomic bomb and by tampering with weather modification techniques like geoengineering. How will people feel about the future? “Men’s hearts failing them for fear, and for looking after those things which are coming on the earth: for the powers of heaven shall be shaken.” —Luke 21:26 Those without God as their anchor will find themselves in a fearful and anxious state as the world becomes increasingly chaotic. Such a state, on a societal level, makes people easy to control and manipulate—a fertile ground for tyranny and scapegoat-seeking narratives, which can easily lead to previously unimaginable atrocities. The Bible predicts this will happen just before Christ’s Second Coming. What sign does Paul give in one of his letters? “For yourselves know perfectly that the day of the Lord so cometh as a thief in the night. For when they shall say, Peace and safety; then sudden destruction cometh upon them, as travail upon a woman with child; and they shall not escape.” —1 Thessalonians 5:2-3 This is related to the previous sign of apprehension about the future, because as nations attempt to bring stability, they will make promises of peace and safety, but according to the Bible, the reality that follows will be the opposite. How will people treat each other? “And because iniquity shall abound, the love of many shall wax cold.” —Matthew 24:12 “This know also, that in the last days perilous times shall come. For men shall be lovers of their own selves, covetous, boasters, proud, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy, Without natural affection, trucebreakers, false accusers, incontinent, fierce, despisers of those that are good, traitors, heady, highminded, lovers of pleasures more than lovers of God; having a form of godliness, but denying the power thereof: from such turn away.” —2 Timothy 3:1-5 As the love of many grows cold, lawlessness will assert itself in society, driven by selfishness in the hearts of those who have rejected God. When the restraining power of God departs through persistent rejection (Romans 1:28), human behavior will begin to resemble that of the pre-flood world, when every thought was only evil continually (Genesis 6:5). But this trend will not be universal. Communities of genuine followers of Christ will exist throughout the world who reflect His character. Specifically, they will be known for their love—which is, in fact, the love of God manifested in them (John 13:35; 1 John 2:5). Thus, in the end, there will be only two classes of people: those who give themselves over to sin, selfishness, and evil, and those who give themselves over to God’s loving mercy and enabling grace. Whether we realize it or not, the decisions we make on a daily basis are bringing us closer to one of these groups. What will people be preoccupied with? “And take heed to yourselves, lest at any time your hearts be overcharged with surfeiting, and drunkenness, and cares of this life, and so that day come upon you unawares.” —Luke 21:34 “But as the days of Noe were, so shall also the coming of the Son of man be. For as in the days that were before the flood they were eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, until the day that Noe entered into the ark, and knew not until the flood came, and took them all away; so shall also the coming of the Son of man be.” —Matthew 24:37-39 Obviously, there is nothing wrong with marriage; after all, it was instituted and blessed by God Himself. Likewise, it is impossible to survive without nourishing our bodies; we must eat, which means we must work, and for the majority of people, work consumes the largest part of their lives. Most are busy trying to survive, so in the absence of intentionality, it is easy to become preoccupied with the temporal at the expense of the spiritual. Yet Christ’s words quietly ring in the background: “Seek ye first the kingdom of God, and his righteousness; and all these things shall be added unto you” (Matthew 6:33). In Noah’s days, most people ignored his invitations to come into the ark because they were too busy doing other things. Where do our priorities stand? Are there any socioeconomic signs? “Go to now, ye rich men, weep and howl for your miseries that shall come upon you. Your riches are corrupted, and your garments are motheaten. Your gold and silver is cankered; and the rust of them shall be a witness against you, and shall eat your flesh as it were fire. Ye have heaped treasure together for the last days. Behold, the hire of the labourers who have reaped down your fields, which is of you kept back by fraud, crieth: and the cries of them which have reaped are entered into the ears of the Lord of sabaoth. Ye have lived in pleasure on the earth, and been wanton; ye have nourished your hearts, as in a day of slaughter.” —James 5:1-5 The gap between rich and poor, coupled with corruption, fraud, and disputes between employers and workers, will continue to widen as we draw nearer to the coming of Christ. As the Holy Spirit is repeatedly resisted and withdrawn, people are left to the control of their carnal nature, whose chief aim has always been preservation and exaltation of self. What is one of the positive signs? “And this gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a witness unto all nations; and then shall the end come.” —Matthew 24:14 With the rapid advancement of communication technology over the past decades—such as television, radio, and the internet—the gospel is now being preached to even the remotest corners of the globe. What once seemed an impossible task has now become a reality. The Bible teaches that religious revivals—both genuine and counterfeit—will spread across the world, and religious discussions will take center stage, resonating through the legislative halls and judicial courtrooms of nations just prior to Christ’s return. Religion in general, and the enforcement of God’s law in particular, will be on everyone’s mind. What specific signs have already been fulfilled? “And I beheld when he had opened the sixth seal, and, lo, there was a great earthquake; and the sun became black as sackcloth of hair, and the moon became as blood; and the stars of heaven fell unto the earth, even as a fig tree casteth her untimely figs, when she is shaken of a mighty wind.” —Revelation 6:12-13 Before the heavenly judgment began in 1844, three specific signs were fulfilled in the exact sequence outlined in Revelation 6. The first (“a great earthquake”) was fulfilled by the Great Lisbon Earthquake of November 1, 1755. The shaking lasted for about six minutes and was so powerful that it was felt across Europe and North Africa, generating tsunami waves that reached as far as the Caribbean. Charles Lyell, a Scottish geologist, described the earthquake’s power: “In no part of the volcanic region of Southern Europe has so tremendous an earthquake occurred in modern times as that which began on the 1st of November, 1755, at Lisbon. A sound of thunder was heard underground, and immediately afterward a violent shock threw down the greater part of that city. In the course of about six minutes, sixty thousand persons perished. The sea first retired, and laid the bar dry; it then rolled in, rising fifty feet above its ordinary level. The mountains of Arrabida, Estrella, Julio, Marvan, and Cintra, being some of the largest in Portugal, were impetuously shaken, as it were from their very foundations; and some of them opened at their summits, which were split and rent in a wonderful manner, huge masses of them being thrown down into the subjacent valleys. Flames are related to have issued from these mountains, which are supposed to have been electric; they are also said to have smoked; but vast clouds of dust may have given rise to this appearance.” The second sign (“the sun became black as sackcloth of hair, and the moon became as blood”) was fulfilled by the New England Dark Day of May 19, 1780. The sun was so completely darkened that candles were required from noon onward, and later that evening, the moon appeared red. An eyewitness in Massachusetts described the scene: “Fear, anxiety, and awe gradually filled the minds of the people. Women stood at the door, looking out upon the dark landscape; men returned from their labor in the fields; the carpenter left his tools, the blacksmith his forge, the tradesman his counter. Schools were dismissed, and tremblingly the children fled homeward. Travelers put up at the nearest farmhouse. ‘What is coming?’ queried every lip and heart. It seemed as if a hurricane was about to dash across the land, or as if it was the day of the consummation of all things. Candles were used; and hearth fires shone as brightly as on a moonless evening in autumn…. Fowls retired to their roosts and went to sleep, cattle gathered at the pasture bars and lowed, frogs peeped, birds sang their evening songs, and bats flew about. But the human knew that night had not come.” The final sign (“the stars of heaven fell”) was fulfilled by the great Leonids meteor shower of November 13, 1833. Witnesses reported that the meteors fell like rain and that no language could describe their splendor. “Its sublimity and awful beauty still linger in many minds. … Never did rain fall much thicker than the meteors fell toward the earth; east, west, north, and south, it was the same. In a word, the whole heavens seemed in motion.” “No language, indeed, can come up to the splendor of that magnificent display; … no one who did not witness it can form an adequate conception of its glory. It seemed as if the whole starry heavens had congregated at one point near the zenith, and were simultaneously shooting forth, with the velocity of lightning, to every part of the horizon; and yet they were not exhausted—thousands swiftly followed in the tracks of thousands, as if created for the occasion.” Jesus prophesied that all three signs will occur again just prior to His Second Coming (Matthew 24:29-30; Mark 13:24-26; Luke 21:25).

Devens, American Progress; or, The Great Events of the Greatest Century, ch. 28, pars. 1-5. F. Reed, Christian Advocate and Journal, Dec. 13, 1833. What is God’s desire for the human race? “The Lord is not slack concerning his promise, as some men count slackness; but is longsuffering to us-ward, not willing that any should perish, but that all should come to repentance.” —2 Peter 3:9 “Say unto them, As I live, saith the Lord GOD, I have no pleasure in the death of the wicked; but that the wicked turn from his way and live: turn ye, turn ye from your evil ways; for why will ye die, O house of Israel?” —Ezekiel 33:11 God does not want anyone to be caught off guard or unprepared for His coming. His desire is that every person be saved, so He is patient with us, granting repeated opportunities and every spiritual blessing (Ephesians 1:3-4) we need to become His sons and daughters. Yet His patience is not infinite (Genesis 6:3), for if it were, the misery of sin would never end. One day, the door to reconciliation with our Maker will close forever. May it never be said of us: “The harvest is past, the summer is ended, and we are not saved” (Jeremiah 8:20). Let us make the most of every God-given opportunity and blessing. What advice and promise does the Bible give? “Watch therefore: for ye know not what hour your Lord doth come. But know this, that if the goodman of the house had known in what watch the thief would come, he would have watched, and would not have suffered his house to be broken up. Therefore be ye also ready: for in such an hour as ye think not the Son of man cometh.” —Matthew 24:42-44 “Watch ye therefore, and pray always, that ye may be accounted worthy to escape all these things that shall come to pass, and to stand before the Son of man.” —Luke 21:36 “I will say of the LORD, He is my refuge and my fortress: my God; in him will I trust. Surely he shall deliver thee from the snare of the fowler, and from the noisome pestilence. He shall cover thee with his feathers, and under his wings shalt thou trust: his truth shall be thy shield and buckler.” —Psalm 91:2-4 Those who watch for the signs of Christ’s coming and earnestly pray that He will prepare them for it will experience His unfailing faithfulness and enabling grace. If received and obeyed, His truth will protect them from deception, and He will be with them every step of the way, no matter what happens around them.\",\"series\":\"The Second Coming\"},\"37\":{\"title\":\"USA in Bible Prophecy\",\"url\":\"/prophecy/usa/\",\"category\":\"Prophecy\",\"description\":\"Will the nation that has become a beacon of freedom to the world continue to uphold the cause of liberty?\",\"body\":\"Is God open about the future? “Surely the Lord GOD will do nothing, but he revealeth his secret unto his servants the prophets.” —Amos 3:7 “For this is good and acceptable in the sight of God our Savior, who desires all men to be saved and to come to the knowledge of the truth.” —1 Timothy 2:3-4 The beautiful thing about God’s character is that He not only knows the future, but also chooses to reveal it in advance to strengthen our faith and prepare us for what is to come. He does not want anyone to be lost because of a lack of knowledge about eternal realities, so He often speaks through prophets to make these truths known to His people. John the Revelator is one such prophet, to whom God revealed events that will unfold near the close of earth’s history. What power is symbolized first in Revelation 13? “And I stood upon the sand of the sea, and saw a beast rise up out of the sea, having seven heads and ten horns, and upon his horns ten crowns, and upon his heads the name of blasphemy. And the beast which I saw was like unto a leopard, and his feet were as the feet of a bear, and his mouth as the mouth of a lion: and the dragon gave him his power, and his seat, and great authority. And I saw one of his heads as it were wounded to death; and his deadly wound was healed: and all the world wondered after the beast. And they worshipped the dragon which gave power unto the beast: and they worshipped the beast, saying, Who is like unto the beast? who is able to make war with him? And there was given unto him a mouth speaking great things and blasphemies; and power was given unto him to continue forty and two months. And he opened his mouth in blasphemy against God, to blaspheme his name, and his tabernacle, and them that dwell in heaven. ““And it was given unto him to make war with the saints, and to overcome them: and power was given him over all kindreds, and tongues, and nations. And all that dwell upon the earth shall worship him, whose names are not written in the book of life of the Lamb slain from the foundation of the world. If any man have an ear, let him hear. He that leadeth into captivity shall go into captivity: he that killeth with the sword must be killed with the sword. Here is the patience and the faith of the saints.” —Revelation 13:1-10 As we learned in a previous study, the beast that rose from the sea represents the Roman papacy, which held influence and power over the world for 42 months. The papacy received a deadly wound at the end of this period in 1798, when Pope Pius VI was taken captive by Napoleon Bonaparte’s general, Louis-Alexandre Berthier. By the way, the beast represented in Revelation 13:2 is a conglomerate of the four beasts described in Daniel 7:2-8, because Catholicism has adopted the works-based religion of Babylon, the Persian system of government (based on the structure of Mithraism), the philosophy of Greece (for example, natural law and the elevation of reason), and the legal system of Rome (for example, canon law). What power is symbolized next? “And I beheld another beast coming up out of the earth; and he had two horns like a lamb, and he spake as a dragon.” —Revelation 13:11 Revelation 13:10 refers to the papal captivity that occurred in 1798, and the second beast is seen emerging around the same time. There is only one power that fits this time frame—the United States. It declared its independence in 1776, adopted the Constitution in 1787, and ratified the Bill of Rights in 1791. By 1798, it was recognized as a rising global power. A key detail in verse 11 is that this power arises “out of the earth,” in contrast to the first beast, which came “out of the sea.” According to Revelation 17:15, the sea symbolizes large, densely populated areas; therefore, the earth represents the opposite—a sparsely populated region. This means the second beast could not emerge from the crowded nations of the Old World; instead, it had to rise from a less populated part of the world—perfectly matching the emergence of the United States. What makes the U.S. unique? “And I beheld another beast coming up out of the earth; and he had two horns like a lamb, and he spake as a dragon.” —Revelation 13:11 The lamb-like horns suggest youth and innocence, emphasizing that this would be a new nation. Horns, on the other hand, represent kings, kingdoms, or governing powers (Daniel 7:24; 8:21). In this case, they symbolize the two founding principles of the United States: civil and religious liberty. These principles have also been described as republicanism (a government without a king) and Protestantism (a church without a pope). Unlike other nations described in Daniel and Revelation, this one is distinguished by the absence of crowns, signifying a republican form of government as opposed to a monarchy. Throughout history, it was common for nations to tax citizens to support a state religion and to oppress religious dissenters. The Pilgrims on the Mayflower, along with many other settlers who followed, were fleeing religious persecution, and so the United States was founded with an entirely new mindset: the separation of church and state. This idea, first brought to prominence by the German princes at the Diet of Speyer in 1529, found its fullest expression more than 250 years later when, in 1791, the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution was adopted. Yet the princes were not its originators; they were merely echoing what Jesus had taught long before, when He declared, “Render to Caesar the things that are Caesar’s, and to God the things that are God’s” (Mark 12:17). In upholding liberty of conscience, Protestantism provided the world with a foundation upon which the future freedom, happiness, and well-being of society could be built. These two principles—civil and religious liberty—“are the secret of its [the United States'] power and prosperity. The oppressed and downtrodden throughout Christendom have turned to this land with interest and hope. Millions have sought its shores, and the United States has risen to a place among the most powerful nations of the earth.” —Ellen G. White, The Great Controversy, p. 441 Closely related to liberty of conscience is the authority of the Bible above that of the Church: “The principles contained in the celebrated Protest of the 19th of April, 1529, constitute the very essence of Protestantism. Now this Protest opposes two abuses of man in matters of faith: the first is the intrusion of the civil magistrate, and the second the arbitrary authority of the church. Instead of these abuses, Protestantism sets the power of conscience above the magistrate, and the authority of the word of God above the visible church. In the first place, it rejects the civil power in divine things, and says with the prophets and apostles, ‘We must obey God rather than man.’ In presence of the crown of Charles the Fifth, it uplifts the crown of Jesus Christ. But it goes farther: it lays down the principle that all human teaching should be subordinate to the oracles of God.” —Merle d’Aubigné, History of the Reformation, Book 13, Chapter 6, Paragraph 18. Will the U.S. experience a change? “And I beheld another beast coming up out of the earth; and he had two horns like a lamb, and he spake as a dragon.” —Revelation 13:11 Revelation 20:2 identifies the dragon as Satan, who uses various earthly powers to persecute and destroy God’s people (Revelation 12:13). Since his rebellion in heaven, Satan’s aim has been to be like God—to usurp His authority and compel people to worship him instead (Isaiah 14:12-14). So what does it mean for a nation to speak like a dragon? A nation “speaks” through its laws and legislative actions, so to speak like a dragon means that a time will come when the United States, under Satan’s influence, will enact laws enforcing false worship. Not only will this be an abandonment of the nation’s duty to protect liberty of conscience for all its citizens—and thus a repudiation of the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution—but it will also be an act of blasphemy, for it will assume authority that belongs only to God. As our Creator, God alone has the authority to prescribe our duties to Him, and He has done so with the Ten Commandments. To enforce these duties by coercion, even if it is claimed to be for the good of society, creates a society of hypocrites who obey outwardly while the heart remains unconverted—the exact opposite of what God desires in His followers (Deuteronomy 30:6; Ezekiel 36:26). The use of coercion has no power to regenerate the heart, and it is utterly repugnant to the God of love who gave Adam and Eve the freedom to walk away from Him—at infinite cost to Himself. Does the Bible give more details? “And he exerciseth all the power of the first beast before him, and causeth the earth and them which dwell therein to worship the first beast, whose deadly wound was healed. And he doeth great wonders, so that he maketh fire come down from heaven on the earth in the sight of men, and deceiveth them that dwell on the earth by the means of those miracles which he had power to do in the sight of the beast; saying to them that dwell on the earth, that they should make an image to the beast, which had the wound by a sword, and did live.” —Revelation 13:12-14 The United States will exercise all the authority of the first beast, the papacy, meaning it will imitate its actions, becoming a persecuting power that compels individuals to act against their conscience. The passage goes on to say that the United States will use its influence to lead other nations to do the same. Clearly, worship will be the central issue in the last days. Every individual will be faced with the question: Will I worship my Creator and Redeemer, Jesus Christ, or the antichrist? The call to align with the antichrist will appear genuinely spiritual, being backed by miracles that will deceive many. Religious fanaticism will run high, causing those who refuse to comply to be labeled divisive, stubborn, legalistic, and unpatriotic. Though this may seem shocking and outlandish, Jesus does not lie, and His words never fail (Titus 1:2). He reveals these things ahead of time so that when they do come to pass, we may believe (John 14:29). Any other details? “And deceiveth them that dwell on the earth by the means of those miracles which he had power to do in the sight of the beast; saying to them that dwell on the earth, that they should make an image to the beast, which had the wound by a sword, and did live. And he had power to give life unto the image of the beast, that the image of the beast should both speak, and cause that as many as would not worship the image of the beast should be killed.” —Revelation 13:14-15 Abandoning its foundational principle of church-state separation, the United States will instead form an unholy union between civil government and apostate Protestantism. In doing so, it will make an image to the beast by establishing a copy of the church-state system used by the papacy during the Middle Ages, when millions were killed for their faith. These actions will appear spiritual, patriotic, and beneficial to society, but they will be satanic in nature—fitly represented by the lamb-like beast (Revelation 13:11). With apostate Protestantism in control of the government, religious legislation will soon follow (Revelation 13:15). It will begin mildly but will eventually escalate, forcing people to comply or face persecution and, ultimately, death. Once this church-state union is formed domestically, the U.S. will pressure other nations to follow its example, leading the entire world to wonder after the beast (Revelation 13:3). There are a couple of additional details worth noting. The deceptive miracle-working described above is a religious activity, which means it is carried out by the apostate Protestant side of the church-state union. These miracles then empower the deception, persuading those who dwell on the earth to make an image to the beast. Notably, the image is made, indicating that it did not exist originally, so this can only apply to a nation that had no church-state union at its founding. Moreover, it is the people dwelling on the earth who make an image to the beast. This suggests a representative form of government, one that is “of the people, by the people, and for the people.” In other words, it will be the people, urged on by the apostate Protestant churches, who will demand religious laws from their representatives in Congress. Abraham Lincoln, Gettysburg Address, November 19, 1863. What will this ultimately lead to? “And he had power to give life unto the image of the beast, that the image of the beast should both speak, and cause that as many as would not worship the image of the beast should be killed. And he causeth all, both small and great, rich and poor, free and bond, to receive a mark in their right hand, or in their foreheads: and that no man might buy or sell, save he that had the mark, or the name of the beast, or the number of his name.” —Revelation 13:15-17 “And the dragon was wroth with the woman, and went to make war with the remnant of her seed, which keep the commandments of God, and have the testimony of Jesus Christ.” —Revelation 12:17 Worshiping and obeying the beast will result in receiving the mark of the beast through the keeping of Sunday as a false holy day, as opposed to worshiping and obeying Jesus and receiving His mark by keeping the seventh-day Sabbath. Those who choose to worship the beast will have chosen to obey the word of a human being rather than the word of their Creator, Jesus Christ. The papacy testifies to this itself: “The church changed Sabbath to Sunday and all the world bows down and worships upon that day in silent obedience to the mandates of the Catholic Church.” As the leader of the international movement to enforce allegiance to the papacy, the United States will proceed to punish those who refuse to comply with its Sunday legislation by denying them the ability to buy or sell. Eventually, it will impose a death sentence, which will become global. Despite all this, the Bible promises that God will protect His people, and their food and water will be sure (Isaiah 33:16; Psalm 34:7). Hartford Weekly Call, February 22, 1884. Has something similar happened in the past? “Nebuchadnezzar the king made an image of gold, whose height was threescore cubits, and the breadth thereof six cubits: he set it up in the plain of Dura, in the province of Babylon.” —Daniel 3:1 “Then the princes, the governors, and captains, the judges, the treasurers, the counsellers, the sheriffs, and all the rulers of the provinces, were gathered together unto the dedication of the image that Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up; and they stood before the image that Nebuchadnezzar had set up. Then an herald cried aloud, To you it is commanded, O people, nations, and languages. That at what time ye hear the sound of the cornet, flute, harp, sackbut, psaltery, dulcimer, and all kinds of musick, ye fall down and worship the golden image that Nebuchadnezzar the king hath set up: and whoso falleth not down and worshippeth shall the same hour be cast into the midst of a burning fiery furnace. Therefore at that time, when all the people heard the sound of the cornet, flute, harp, sackbut, psaltery, and all kinds of musick, all the people, the nations, and the languages, fell down and worshipped the golden image that Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up.” —Daniel 3:3-7 “Nebuchadnezzar spake and said unto them, Is it true, O Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, do not ye serve my gods, nor worship the golden image which I have set up?” —Daniel 3:14 “If it be so, our God whom we serve is able to deliver us from the burning fiery furnace, and he will deliver us out of thine hand, O king. But if not, be it known unto thee, O king, that we will not serve thy gods, nor worship the golden image which thou hast set up.” —Daniel 3:17-18 A very similar scenario played out in Babylon during the reign of Nebuchadnezzar. It also involved a universal command forcing all to worship an image, with the death penalty for those who refused. Most complied, but a small group of friends refused to compromise by violating God’s commandments. Their love for God was stronger than death (Revelation 12:11), and they chose to remain faithful to Him by His grace. Has the U.S. passed religious legislation before? In 1888, Senator Henry Blair proposed a bill that sought to establish Sunday as a national day of rest, which was fortunately defeated; nevertheless, a turning point came just four years later. In the landmark 1892 case Church of the Holy Trinity v. United States, the Supreme Court declared the United States a Christian nation, thereby setting a precedent that would justify future religious legislation. That same year, Congress passed legislation requiring the World’s Columbian Exposition to close on Sundays in honor of Sunday observance, a mandate endorsed by President Benjamin Harrison, who made government funding for the fair conditional on Sunday closure. As a result, only 101 years after the ratification of the First Amendment, which established the separation of church and state, all three branches of the United States government had effectively repudiated that principle. Today, many states already have “blue laws” that restrict commerce on Sundays, based on the Supreme Court’s 1961 ruling in McGowan v. Maryland, which held that such laws do not violate the First Amendment. This was done despite the 1797 Treaty of Tripoli—signed by President George Washington and approved by the U.S. Senate—which, in Article 11, declared that “the government of the United States is not in any sense founded upon the Christian religion.” How influential is the papacy? The papacy has emerged as the most powerful religio-political entity in the world. Nearly every major country maintains an official ambassador to the Vatican, including the United States. During Pope Francis’ 2015 visit to the U.S., President Obama personally welcomed him, with the White House describing the event as a symbol of the high level of respect America holds for the pontiff. The visit also marked the first time in American history that a pope addressed a joint session of Congress. In addition to its political influence, the papacy’s religious influence is likewise unparalleled, spanning across the religious spectrum. For instance, in 2014, Francis presided over an ecumenical worship service attended by representatives from the Orthodox, Anglican, Lutheran, Methodist, and other Christian traditions, during which he called for greater Christian unity. Throughout his pontificate, Francis has consistently sought to build bridges with those outside the Christian faith as well. Such efforts have elevated the papacy’s global influence—an influence that, according to Bible prophecy, will continue to grow in the days to come. Irish Daily Mail, September 23, 2015. Catholic Herald, January 27, 2014. Of course, there is nothing inherently wrong with unity. After all, Jesus teaches us to love our neighbors—even our enemies—and He prayed for unity among His disciples (Matthew 22:39; 5:44; John 17:11). Unity is indeed biblical, so long as it is not built on the compromise of truth as revealed in God’s Word. Unfortunately, this is often not the case. How influential is the U.S. today? Few would dispute that the United States is a global leader and a fulcrum of influence. Although it faces challenges to its power from countries such as China and Russia, it continues to dominate the global stage. “What ultimately makes the difference between war and peace … is not good intentions, or strong words, or a grand coalition. It is the capability, credibility, and global reach of American hard power.” “The United States is and remains the one indispensable nation. That has been true for the century past, and it will be true for the century to come.” Contrary to the belief that the United States will lose its elevated standing and become merely one among several strong nations, Bible prophecy indicates that this simply cannot be. The United States will remain a leading world power until the Second Coming of Christ. Senator John McCain, remarks upon receiving the Peace through Strength Award at the Reagan National Defense Forum, Simi Valley, CA, November 15, 2014. Barack Obama, speech at the U.S. Military Academy, West Point, NY, May 28, 2014. What can cause a worldwide religious law to be passed? Potential catalysts for global upheaval include terrorism, civil unrest, crime, a major economic collapse, epidemics, nuclear threats, political corruption, social inequality, judicial injustice, escalating immorality, and catastrophic natural disasters. Such crises could readily lead to calls for the enactment of drastic, previously unthinkable legislation in the United States—laws that could then be promoted globally under the banner of world peace and unity. However, this unity will likely be built on compromise and deception rather than on truth, and those who refuse to conform will likely be scorned and labeled as fanatics—as often happens in times of crisis when groupthink prevails. Ultimately, in the name of preserving peace and unity, eliminating such individuals will be considered a service to God, as foretold in John 16:2, by those who have become deluded through their persistent rejection of the truth (2 Thessalonians 2:10-12). Will there be a false religious revival? “And he doeth great wonders, so that he maketh fire come down from heaven on the earth in the sight of men, and deceiveth them that dwell on the earth by the means of those miracles which he had power to do in the sight of the beast; saying to them that dwell on the earth, that they should make an image to the beast, which had the wound by a sword, and did live.” —Revelation 13:13-14 “Then if any man shall say unto you, Lo, here is Christ, or there; believe it not. For there shall arise false Christs, and false prophets, and shall shew great signs and wonders; insomuch that, if it were possible, they shall deceive the very elect.” —Matthew 24:23-24 “And I saw three unclean spirits like frogs come out of the mouth of the dragon, and out of the mouth of the beast, and out of the mouth of the false prophet. For they are the spirits of devils, working miracles, which go forth unto the kings of the earth and of the whole world, to gather them to the battle of that great day of God Almighty.” —Revelation 16:13-14 As global conditions become increasingly unbearable, a worldwide movement calling for a return to God—centered on synchronized, family-focused, and environmentally conscious Sunday observance—will be promoted as the only solution. This movement will be accompanied by signs, wonders, and miracles performed through the power of Satan, resulting in a counterfeit revival in which every person will be urged—and eventually compelled—to participate by honoring the papacy’s counterfeit “holy” day in place of God’s true and holy seventh-day Sabbath, instituted at Creation. These signs and wonders will be so convincing that Satan will attempt to deceive even God’s own people. Fallen spirits (angels of Satan) could appear as deceased loved ones (Revelation 18:23), and possibly even as Bible prophets or apostles, claiming to be sent by God to promote unity and peace. The pressure to enforce Sunday legislation will be intense, and some—especially those indifferent to religion—may comply simply for economic, social, or even environmental reasons. It has become common in public discourse to dismiss—nay, to denigrate—God’s Sabbath by referring to it as the “Jewish Sabbath.” Yet the truth remains: there was not a single Jew in the Garden of Eden when God instituted it. What will be the crowning deception? “For such are false apostles, deceitful workers, transforming themselves into the apostles of Christ. And no marvel; for Satan himself is transformed into an angel of light. Therefore it is no great thing if his ministers also be transformed as the ministers of righteousness; whose end shall be according to their works.” —2 Corinthians 11:13-15 “Then if any man shall say unto you, Lo, here is Christ, or there; believe it not. For there shall arise false Christs, and false prophets, and shall shew great signs and wonders; insomuch that, if it were possible, they shall deceive the very elect.” —Matthew 24:23-24 “Ye are of your father the devil, and the lusts of your father ye will do. He was a murderer from the beginning, and abode not in the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he speaketh a lie, he speaketh of his own: for he is a liar, and the father of it.” —John 8:44 There will be reports of a dazzling angel claiming to be Jesus, but in reality, it will be Satan impersonating Him. The fallen angel could quote Scripture, perform miracles, and even claim to have changed the Sabbath to Sunday in order to urge the world to honor his counterfeit day. The Bible says the deception will be so effective that the whole world will be deceived by it (Revelation 13:3)—except for God’s true followers, who will test everything by Scripture (Isaiah 8:19-20; 2 Timothy 2:15). They will know that God’s law cannot change (Luke 16:17; 21:33). Moreover, they will recognize it is not Jesus, because according to the Bible, He will not touch the earth at His second coming but will remain in the clouds to meet His people in the air (1 Thessalonians 4:16-17). Will there be a genuine revival? “And I saw another angel fly in the midst of heaven, having the everlasting gospel to preach unto them that dwell on the earth, and to every nation, and kindred, and tongue, and people, saying with a loud voice, Fear God, and give glory to him; for the hour of his judgment is come: and worship him that made heaven, and earth, and the sea, and the fountains of waters. ““And there followed another angel, saying, Babylon is fallen, is fallen, that great city, because she made all nations drink of the wine of the wrath of her fornication. ““And the third angel followed them, saying with a loud voice, If any man worship the beast and his image, and receive his mark in his forehead, or in his hand, the same shall drink of the wine of the wrath of God, which is poured out without mixture into the cup of his indignation; and he shall be tormented with fire and brimstone in the presence of the holy angels, and in the presence of the Lamb: and the smoke of their torment ascendeth up for ever and ever: and they have no rest day nor night, who worship the beast and his image, and whosoever receiveth the mark of his name. Here is the patience of the saints: here are they that keep the commandments of God, and the faith of Jesus.” —Revelation 14:6-12 As Satan works to deceive the world into compromising with error by casting aside God’s Sabbath in favor of a counterfeit day He never appointed, God will have a people who will proclaim a powerful, three-part message to the entire world—symbolized by the three angels of Revelation 14. This message will expose Satan’s deceptions so that every person will be informed about God’s true Sabbath and warned against receiving the mark of the beast—the counterfeit Sunday— because this decision carries eternal consequences. Those who choose to obey—and thus worship—the beast by honoring his man-made “holy” day will receive his mark, by which they cut themselves off from God’s mercy and exclude themselves from His eternal kingdom. But there will also be those who join God’s side, choosing to worship Him on His holy day. Through faith, Jesus’ sacrifice on the cross will cover their confessed and forsaken sins, and His grace will transform them into obedient followers, sealing them for eternity (Revelation 7:2-3). It may seem improbable that people’s eternal destiny will be determined by the day they choose to observe, but God often uses simple means to test our loyalty; affter all, Adam and Eve were expelled from the Garden for eating fruit from the wrong tree. Of course, the fruit was merely the means of settling a far greater issue—trust. Would Adam and Eve trust God or Satan? In the same way, the day of worship will represent the far greater issue of authority. Every person will have to decide: Whom will I acknowledge as the ultimate authority over my life—God or Satan? Who is the false prophet? “And I saw three unclean spirits like frogs come out of the mouth of the dragon, and out of the mouth of the beast, and out of the mouth of the false prophet.” —Revelation 16:13 “And the beast was taken, and with him the false prophet that wrought miracles before him, with which he deceived them that had received the mark of the beast, and them that worshipped his image. These both were cast alive into a lake of fire burning with brimstone.” —Revelation 19:20 The false prophet works miracles to deceive people into receiving the beast’s mark and worshiping his image. This miracle-working carries a spiritual connotation, as does the term false prophet. The lamb-like beast of Revelation 13:11-18 (representing the United States) also performs miracles (Revelation 13:13-14), and thus appears spiritual and trustworthy. In reality, however, it sets itself against God’s commandments by lending its power and influence to promote the Sunday-keeping movement on behalf of the papacy. The false prophet, therefore, represents the religious aspect—apostate Protestantism—of the lamb-like beast. It is called the false prophet because of Protestantism’s acceptance and propagation of the Preterist and Futurist interpretations of prophecy, both of which are false. The Protestant Reformers—such as John Wycliffe, John Huss, Martin Luther, William Tyndale, Nicholas Ridley, Thomas Cranmer, and John Knox—all held to the Historicist view, which identifies the Antichrist as the papacy; however, both Preterism and Futurism divert attention away from the papacy. Sadly, Protestantism has rejected the view of its founders and has thus become the false prophet. Incidentally, both interpretations were introduced by Roman Catholic Jesuits: Preterism by Luis de Alcázar and Futurism by Francisco Ribera. Preterism holds that the prophecies of Revelation were fulfilled in the past, prior to the rise of the papacy, while Futurism teaches that the Antichrist—understood as a future individual—will appear after the literal rebuilding of the Third Temple in Jerusalem. Futurism is especially popular in conservative religious circles in Washington, D.C., and appears to be influencing, at least in part, national policy regarding Israel. Is this the battle of Armageddon? “And the sixth angel poured out his vial upon the great river Euphrates; and the water thereof was dried up, that the way of the kings of the east might be prepared. And I saw three unclean spirits like frogs come out of the mouth of the dragon, and out of the mouth of the beast, and out of the mouth of the false prophet. For they are the spirits of devils, working miracles, which go forth unto the kings of the earth and of the whole world, to gather them to the battle of that great day of God Almighty. Behold, I come as a thief. Blessed is he that watcheth, and keepeth his garments, lest he walk naked, and they see his shame. And he gathered them together into a place called in the Hebrew tongue Armageddon.” —Revelation 16:12-16 “And I saw the beast, and the kings of the earth, and their armies, gathered together to make war against him that sat on the horse, and against his army.” —Revelation 19:19 “These have one mind, and shall give their power and strength unto the beast. These shall make war with the Lamb, and the Lamb shall overcome them: for he is Lord of lords, and King of kings: and they that are with him are called, and chosen, and faithful.” —Revelation 17:13-14 The battle of Armageddon is the final conflict between Christ and Satan. It is mentioned in the context of the beast and the false prophet, which indicates that it will be initiated by them and will involve all the nations of the world in a united effort against Jesus and His people, with the goal of destroying all who refuse to worship the beast. But God will intervene. The symbolic Euphrates River will dry up, meaning that popular support for the beast will disappear (Revelation 17:15), just prior to the coming of the “kings from the east,” a reference to the Second Coming of Christ (Ezekiel 43:2; Matthew 24:27), when the people of God will be delivered (Revelation 19:11-20). The battle will resume after the millennium, when Satan and his followers surround the New Jerusalem in an attempt to capture it, but before they do, they are destroyed by fire from heaven (Revelation 20:9), bringing the battle—and the great controversy between good and evil—to a final end. How can I be safe from deception? “To the law and to the testimony: if they speak not according to this word, it is because there is no light in them.” —Isaiah 8:20 “If any man will do his will, he shall know of the doctrine, whether it be of God, or whether I speak of myself.” —John 7:17 “I am the vine, ye are the branches: He that abideth in me, and I in him, the same bringeth forth much fruit: for without me ye can do nothing.” —John 15:5 Jesus will help me identify and avoid deception if I test every teaching by the Bible (Psalm 119:104), willingly follow the truth as He reveals it to me, and stay close to Him daily through prayer and the reading of His Word. While the battle may appear to be against Christ’s followers, ultimately it is against Him. The battle is His, and it has already been won on a hill called Calvary. The only question is: have I given Him my heart and joined His winning side? What does the Bible promise? “He that dwelleth in the secret place of the most High shall abide under the shadow of the Almighty. I will say of the LORD, He is my refuge and my fortress: my God; in him will I trust. Surely he shall deliver thee from the snare of the fowler, and from the noisome pestilence. He shall cover thee with his feathers, and under his wings shalt thou trust: his truth shall be thy shield and buckler. Thou shalt not be afraid for the terror by night; nor for the arrow that flieth by day; nor for the pestilence that walketh in darkness; nor for the destruction that wasteth at noonday. A thousand shall fall at thy side, and ten thousand at thy right hand; but it shall not come nigh thee. Only with thine eyes shalt thou behold and see the reward of the wicked. ““Because thou hast made the LORD, which is my refuge, even the most High, thy habitation; there shall no evil befall thee, neither shall any plague come nigh thy dwelling. For he shall give his angels charge over thee, to keep thee in all thy ways. They shall bear thee up in their hands, lest thou dash thy foot against a stone. Thou shalt tread upon the lion and adder: the young lion and the dragon shalt thou trample under feet. Because he hath set his love upon me, therefore will I deliver him: I will set him on high, because he hath known my name. He shall call upon me, and I will answer him: I will be with him in trouble; I will deliver him, and honour him. With long life will I satisfy him, and shew him my salvation.” —Psalm 91 God promises that His truth will be our shield against the arrows of deception, keeping us on the narrow path of righteousness

      "series": "Baptized by the Spirit",
      "body": "What did Jesus tell His disciples before His ascension? “Go ye therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost: teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you: and, lo, I am with you alway, even unto the end of the world.” —Matthew 28:19-20 “He that believeth and is baptized shall be saved; but he that believeth not shall be damned.” —Mark 16:16 Just before Jesus ascended to heaven, He gave His disciples the “Great Commission”—to take the gospel to the world by sharing His teachings and encouraging those who accept Him to be baptized. In fact, the book of Mark makes an inextricable connection between believing in Jesus and being baptized, which shows that baptism is an integral part of the Christian experience. Why is baptism important? “Jesus answered, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born of water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God.” —John 3:5 “That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved. For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation.” —Romans 10:9-10 “For as many of you as have been baptized into Christ have put on Christ.” —Galatians 3:27 During His conversation with Nicodemus, Jesus emphasized that to be born again is to be born of water and the Spirit. In doing so, He made it clear that baptism is a privilege and a responsibility that all Christians are called to experience. Salvation is a gift from God, received through faith in Jesus Christ (Ephesians 2:8-9), and this faith is demonstrated through a public, unashamed confession of Him (Romans 10:9-10; Luke 12:8-9; 2 Timothy 1:12). At baptism, we make an open declaration to all present that we have accepted Him as Lord and Savior, been clothed with the robe of His righteousness (Galatians 3:27; Isaiah 61:10), and have taken on a new name and identity: follower of Christ, son or daughter of God! By making a public stand for Christ, we also become His witnesses to others, inspiring them to do the same in their own lives. What does baptism replace? “In whom also ye are circumcised with the circumcision made without hands, in putting off the body of the sins of the flesh by the circumcision of Christ: buried with him in baptism, wherein also ye are risen with him through the faith of the operation of God, who hath raised him from the dead. And you, being dead in your sins and the uncircumcision of your flesh, hath he quickened together with him, having forgiven you all trespasses.” —Colossians 2:11-13 In the Old Testament, circumcision was an outward covenant sign of an inward reality—a change of heart (Romans 2:28-29; Deuteronomy 30:6). It pointed forward to sin being “cut off”—forgiven and overcome—through Christ. In the New Testament, baptism is an outward covenant sign of the same reality: His death on the cross paid the penalty for our sins, opening the way to forgiveness, while His perfect life overcame the power of sin, opening the way to victory in our own lives, since the sins He overcame were our sins, and He did so in our flesh (1 Peter 2:24; Romans 8:3-4). How many methods of baptism are there? “There is one body, and one Spirit, even as ye are called in one hope of your calling; one Lord, one faith, one baptism, one God and Father of all, who is above all, and through all, and in you all.” —Ephesians 4:4-6 The Bible declares that there is only one true baptism, and the word itself offers a clue as to what it involves. The term “baptize” comes from the Greek word baptizō, which means “to immerse,” “to submerge,” or “to dip under.” This might come as a surprise to some, but the Bible never describes baptism using the words “sprinkle” or “pour.” Biblical baptism is a full immersion in water. How was Jesus baptized? “And John also was baptizing in Aenon near to Salim, because there was much water there: and they came, and were baptized.” —John 3:23 “Then cometh Jesus from Galilee to Jordan unto John, to be baptized of him. But John forbad him, saying, I have need to be baptized of thee, and comest thou to me? And Jesus answering said unto him, Suffer it to be so now: for thus it becometh us to fulfil all righteousness. Then he suffered him. And Jesus, when he was baptized, went up straightway out of the water: and, lo, the heavens were opened unto him, and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove, and lighting upon him: and lo a voice from heaven, saying, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.” —Matthew 3:13-17 “And it came to pass in those days, that Jesus came from Nazareth of Galilee, and was baptized of John in Jordan. And straightway coming up out of the water, he saw the heavens opened, and the Spirit like a dove descending upon him.” —Mark 1:9-10 John the Baptist chose an area with plenty of water because he practiced the biblical form of baptism—full immersion. Both Matthew and Mark make it clear that this was the type of baptism Jesus received, as they describe Him “coming up out of the water,” indicating that He had first gone down into the water to be baptized. Are there other examples of baptism? “And he commanded the chariot to stand still: and they went down both into the water, both Philip and the eunuch; and he baptized him. And when they were come up out of the water, the Spirit of the Lord caught away Philip, that the eunuch saw him no more: and he went on his way rejoicing.” —Acts 8:38-39 The Bible gives the example of Philip and the Ethiopian eunuch to show that Jesus’ disciples did not change the method of baptism after His ascension. Both Philip and the eunuch went down into the water, and after Philip baptized him, they came up out of the water. This mirrors the description and form of baptism that Jesus Himself received. What does baptism represent? “And now why tarriest thou? arise, and be baptized, and wash away thy sins, calling on the name of the Lord.” —Acts 22:16 “Buried with him in baptism, wherein also ye are risen with him through the faith of the operation of God, who hath raised him from the dead.” —Colossians 2:12 “Know ye not, that so many of us as were baptized into Jesus Christ were baptized into his death? Therefore we are buried with him by baptism into death: that like as Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the Father, even so we also should walk in newness of life. For if we have been planted together in the likeness of his death, we shall be also in the likeness of his resurrection: Knowing this, that our old man is crucified with him, that the body of sin might be destroyed, that henceforth we should not serve sin.” —Romans 6:3-6 “That ye put off concerning the former conversation the old man, which is corrupt according to the deceitful lusts; and be renewed in the spirit of your mind; and that ye put on the new man, which after God is created in righteousness and true holiness.” —Ephesians 4:22-24 Generally speaking, baptism is a symbol of cleansing from sin, which every person needs, as all have sinned (Romans 3:23). More specifically, it symbolizes the death and burial of the old life of sin and the birth of a new life in Jesus. In other words, it represents Jesus’ death, burial, and resurrection. As we experience His selfless love for us, we are motivated: 1. to die to sin in our own lives, which involves dying to self, 2. to bury that old life under the water in baptism, and 3. to rise to a new life in Jesus by the power of His Holy Spirit. Baptism is a beautiful and powerful symbol of how Jesus’ death, burial, and resurrection replace our old identity with a completely new one in Him. Using the correct form of baptism matters because any other form undermines the symbolism and meaning of baptism by immersion. Alternative forms portray a vastly different spiritual reality—one that does not reflect the burial of the old life. Biblical baptism illustrates that the Christian life is not merely about becoming a better person; it is about completely crucifying the old self (Galatians 2:20; 6:14). A failure to fully surrender every area of life to Jesus results in a baptism where the person is, in a sense, “buried alive”—a distortion that robs the believer of the rich blessings Jesus longs to give (John 15:11). What else accompanies water baptism? “Jesus answered, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born of water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God.” —John 3:5 In addition to water baptism, every sincere Christian will also receive the baptism of the Holy Spirit, since full immersion in water is merely a visible manifestation of the inward immersion by the Holy Spirit. The good news is that God is more than willing to give His Spirit to anyone who asks (Luke 11:13). Those who desire to be transformed in life and character by the Spirit will receive Him, and He, in turn, will convict them of sin and bestow the righteousness of Jesus upon them (John 16:8; Titus 3:3-7). The baptism of the Holy Spirit is absolutely essential; without Him, we cannot change ourselves (Jeremiah 13:23). Evidence of receiving the baptism of the Spirit includes producing the fruit of the Spirit described in Galatians 5:22-23, as well as receiving His gifts—both of which enable us to be effective ambassadors for God (2 Corinthians 5:19-21). How do I know if I’m ready for baptism? “Go ye therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost: teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you: and, lo, I am with you alway, even unto the end of the world.” —Matthew 28:19-20 “He that believeth and is baptized shall be saved; but he that believeth not shall be damned.” —Mark 16:16 “Then Peter said unto them, Repent, and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins, and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost.” —Acts 2:38 “For if we have been planted together in the likeness of his death, we shall be also in the likeness of his resurrection: knowing this, that our old man is crucified with him, that the body of sin might be destroyed, that henceforth we should not serve sin.” —Romans 6:5-6 Baptism is an outward sign of an inward change of heart. It is to the Christian what a wedding is to marriage—a public declaration of commitment. Because baptism represents a commitment to Jesus as one’s personal Savior (Acts 8:37), it is vital to first come to know Him and understand His teachings. This aligns with the commission Jesus gave His disciples just before His ascension: to share His teachings throughout the world and to baptize those who accept them and believe in Him. Naturally, His teachings will bring conviction of sin, leading the genuine believer to repent of past sins (Acts 5:31) and to choose no longer to serve sin, but to die to self through the power of the Holy Spirit. This experience is known as being born of the Spirit (born again), and when it is present in a believer’s life, that person is ready to make the exciting—yet serious—public commitment to be faithful to Jesus, even to the point of death. Incidentally, this means that infant baptism is not appropriate, because an infant is not mature enough to understand the prerequisites or make the commitment. After all, Jesus Himself was baptized as an adult. Instead of being baptized, infants can be dedicated to God by their parents—as Jesus was (Luke 2:21-39)—while the parents also dedicate themselves to doing all they can to raise a child who knows and loves God and will one day make that baptismal commitment. The Bible, however, does not specify a particular age for baptism, because every person’s spiritual experience and maturity are different. Adult baptism, also known as believer’s baptism, was rediscovered by the Anabaptists (“re-baptizers”) during the Protestant Reformation. Prior to the rise of their movement in 1525, infant baptism was the norm across Christendom; the Anabaptists, however, believed that infants are incapable of understanding the gospel or demonstrating the repentance and faith that accompany it. They were ruthlessly persecuted for these beliefs by both Protestants and Catholics alike. For instance, on March 7, 1526, the city council of Zurich—a Protestant stronghold—passed an edict proclaiming the death sentence (by drowning) upon them. Persecution was fierce because baptism was not merely a religious issue but also a civil one. At the heart of the matter was the issue of liberty of conscience—the right to think for oneself—which was a radical idea at the time, threatening the stability of the civil order. Their persecution continued even after the 1648 Peace of Westphalia gave Lutherans and Calvinists official recognition, forcing the Anabaptists to seek reprieve through emigration to America. Today, their descendants include the Mennonites and the Amish, yet we all benefit from the courageous stand they took in offering up their lives for liberty of conscience—especially those living in the United States—because their stand was eventually enshrined in the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. What about the thief on the cross? “And one of the malefactors which were hanged railed on him, saying, If thou be Christ, save thyself and us. But the other answering rebuked him, saying, Dost not thou fear God, seeing thou art in the same condemnation? And we indeed justly; for we receive the due reward of our deeds: but this man hath done nothing amiss. And he said unto Jesus, Lord, remember me when thou comest into thy kingdom.” —Luke 23:39-42 The conversion of the thief on the cross demonstrates that there can be unique circumstances which prevent a person from being baptized by immersion. In such cases, the baptism of Jesus is counted on their behalf. However, this is not an excuse for someone who is able but unwilling to be baptized. Baptism remains a vital public commitment to Jesus. What does baptism not do? “For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God:” —Ephesians 2:8 It is important to note that we are not saved by baptism, as salvation is by grace through faith; however, baptism is an act of obedience to Jesus, born out of a conversion marked by genuine love for and gratitude to Him. Baptism does not remove temptation either, but God promises that we will not be tempted beyond what we are able to bear; He will always provide a way of escape (1 Corinthians 10:13). Finally, baptism itself does not change the heart—it is a symbol of a heart already transformed by the power of the Holy Spirit. What is baptism connected with? “Then they that gladly received his word were baptized: and the same day there were added unto them about three thousand souls. And they continued stedfastly in the apostles’ doctrine and fellowship, and in breaking of bread, and in prayers. … And they, continuing daily with one accord in the temple, and breaking bread from house to house, did eat their meat with gladness and singleness of heart, praising God, and having favour with all the people. And the Lord added to the church daily such as should be saved.” —Acts 2:41-42, 46-47 “And He is the head of the body, the church, who is the beginning, the firstborn from the dead, that in all things He may have the preeminence.” —Colossians 1:18 “For by one Spirit are we all baptized into one body, whether we be Jews or Gentiles, whether we be bond or free; and have been all made to drink into one Spirit.” —1 Corinthians 12:13 When the disciples began proclaiming the teachings of Jesus, those who believed and were baptized became part of the body of Christ—His church—of which He is Lord. The church is a community of Christ’s followers who nurture one another’s walk with God, work together to serve others, and spread the good news of the gospel. A decision for baptism, therefore, comes with the blessing of fellowship with other believers who accept all of Jesus’ teachings as revealed in the Bible and, by the power of the Holy Spirit, seek to live them out. Can a person be rebaptized? “He said unto them, Have ye received the Holy Ghost since ye believed? And they said unto him, We have not so much as heard whether there be any Holy Ghost. And he said unto them, Unto what then were ye baptized? And they said, Unto John’s baptism. Then said Paul, John verily baptized with the baptism of repentance, saying unto the people, that they should believe on him which should come after him, that is, on Christ Jesus. When they heard this, they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus.” —Acts 19:2-5 Rebaptism may be appropriate when new truth is discovered, as was the case with the group of believers who had been baptized by John but had never heard of the Holy Spirit. After learning this life-changing truth, they were so deeply impacted that they chose to be rebaptized. Another situation in which rebaptism is fitting is when a person desires to return to Jesus after having turned away from Him. Baptism is like a marriage ceremony with Jesus; so if genuine love has been rekindled in the heart—and it is accompanied by a renewed commitment to be faithful through both good times and bad—it can be appropriate to make a new public pledge to Him. Who has the authority to baptize? “Then the eleven disciples went away into Galilee, into a mountain where Jesus had appointed them. And when they saw him, they worshipped him: but some doubted. And Jesus came and spake unto them, saying, All power is given unto me in heaven and in earth. Go ye therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost: teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you: and, lo, I am with you alway, even unto the end of the world.” —Matthew 28:16-20 Jesus gave the authority to baptize exclusively to His disciples, whom He commissioned to faithfully teach all the truths He had commanded them. Therefore, when the Holy Spirit leads someone to seek baptism, it is important to find a church that teaches the full scope of Jesus’ teachings and to request that the church’s ordained male pastor—the modern equivalent of an ordained disciple—perform the baptism. By limiting baptismal authority to ordained pastors, Jesus established a structure designed to uphold the truths He entrusted to His Church and to safeguard her from compromise with error. Is it wise to put off baptism? “And now why tarriest thou? arise, and be baptized, and wash away thy sins, calling on the name of the Lord.” —Acts 22:16 “And as he reasoned of righteousness, temperance, and judgment to come, Felix trembled, and answered, Go thy way for this time; when I have a convenient season, I will call for thee.” —Acts 24:25 When the Holy Spirit brings conviction to the heart, one of Satan’s most effective strategies is to tempt that person to delay their decision until a more convenient time—a time that never comes. Postponing baptism because of a feeling of not being “good enough” is unwise. We begin our Christian walk as spiritual infants, not mature adults, and if babies waited to attempt walking until they were certain they would never fall, they would never learn to walk. So if the Holy Spirit is prompting you to be baptized, the Bible invites you to make plans today—without delay. How does God feel about a baptized person? “I say unto you, that likewise joy shall be in heaven over one sinner that repenteth, more than over ninety and nine just persons, which need no repentance.” —Luke 15:7 “In that day it shall be said to Jerusalem: “Do not fear; Zion, let not your hands be weak. The Lord your God in your midst, the Mighty One, will save; He will rejoice over you with gladness, He will quiet you with His love, He will rejoice over you with singing.”” —Zephaniah 3:16-17, NKJV Not only is there joy in heaven over every repentant sinner, but Zephaniah tells us that God Himself rejoices in song over His people! The truth is, we have the ability to make heaven rejoice, and stepping into the waters of baptism to make a public commitment to Jesus is sure to bring melodies of joy to the heavenly courts.",

      "body": "How much of the Bible is inspired? By whom? For what purpose? “All Scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness, that the man of God may be perfect, thoroughly furnished unto all good works.” —2 Timothy 3:16-17 How did it maintain its miraculous unity? “Knowing this first, that no prophecy of the scripture is of any private interpretation. For the prophecy came not in old time by the will of man: but holy men of God spake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost.” —2 Peter 1:20-21 The Bible was written over a period of 1,500 years by about 40 different authors whose education and background varied greatly. The Bible’s unity under these circumstances is astonishing and can only be explained by divine inspiration. Can the Bible be trusted? “Thy word is true from the beginning, and every one of thy righteous judgments endureth for ever.” —Psalm 119:160 Hasn’t it been corrupted over the ages? “The words of the LORD are pure words, as silver tried in a furnace of earth, purified seven times. Thou shalt keep them, O LORD, thou shalt preserve them from this generation for ever.” —Psalm 12:6-7 God’s word is truth, and He will ensure it stays that way. Can God’s Word be changed or done away with? “Heaven and earth shall pass away, but my words shall not pass away.” —Matthew 24:35 “For all flesh is as grass, and all the glory of man as the flower of grass. The grass withereth, and the flower thereof falleth away: but the word of the LORD endureth for ever. And this is the word which by the gospel is preached unto you.” —1 Peter 1:24-25 Why did God give us the Scriptures? “For whatsoever things were written aforetime were written for our learning, that we through patience and comfort of the scriptures might have hope.” —Romans 15:4 “For this is good and acceptable in the sight of God our Savior, who will have all men to be saved, and to come unto the knowledge of the truth.” —1 Timothy 2:3-4 “And that from a child thou hast known the holy scriptures, which are able to make thee wise unto salvation through faith which is in Christ Jesus.” —2 Timothy 3:15 God gave us the Scriptures so we can learn about His character and be grounded in His truth while navigating a world of deception, so that through it we might be saved from sin and have hope of eternal life. Who do the Scriptures point me to? “Search the scriptures; for in them ye think ye have eternal life: and they are they which testify of me.” —John 5:39 “Looking unto Jesus the author and finisher of our faith; who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross, despising the shame, and is set down at the right hand of the throne of God.” —Hebrews 12:2 “Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.” —John 14:6 All the stories of the Bible point me to Jesus, the Author and Finisher of my faith. How can I be blessed by the Bible? “Study to shew thyself approved unto God, a workman that needeth not to be ashamed, rightly dividing the word of truth.” —2 Timothy 2:15 “These were more noble than those in Thessalonica, in that they received the word with all readiness of mind, and searched the scriptures daily, whether those things were so.” —Acts 17:11 The Bible is unlike any other book because it is my Creator and Redeemer’s special gift to me. He speaks to me through it, and it is my privilege to read it daily because by doing so I’ll draw closer to Him. Every relationship is built on spending quality time together, and my relationship with Jesus is no different. Is God’s Word as important as physical food? “But he answered and said, It is written, Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God.” —Matthew 4:4 “Neither have I gone back from the commandment of his lips; I have esteemed the words of his mouth more than my necessary food.” —Job 23:12 “Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that believeth on me hath everlasting life. I am that bread of life. Your fathers did eat manna in the wilderness, and are dead. This is the bread which cometh down from heaven, that a man may eat thereof, and not die. I am the living bread which came down from heaven: if any man eat of this bread, he shall live for ever: and the bread that I will give is my flesh, which I will give for the life of the world.” —John 6:47-51 Jesus is the spiritual bread that brings everlasting life, and we “eat” it whenever we read His Word. Our need for Him is actually greater than our need for physical food. Who did Jesus say will help me understand the Bible? “Howbeit when he, the Spirit of truth, is come, he will guide you into all truth: for he shall not speak of himself; but whatsoever he shall hear, that shall he speak: and he will shew you things to come.” —John 16:13 Why should I ask for the Holy Spirit’s guidance? “Which things also we speak, not in the words which man’s wisdom teacheth, but which the Holy Ghost teacheth; comparing spiritual things with spiritual. But the natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God: for they are foolishness unto him: neither can he know them, because they are spiritually discerned.” —1 Corinthians 2:13-14 Because spiritual things are spiritually discerned and because the Bible is full of stories with symbolism, I need the Holy Spirit to open my spiritual eyes and help me bring these stories to life. Humility and a teachable attitude is also a crucial part of it. How should I study the Bible? “Whom shall he teach knowledge? and whom shall he make to understand doctrine? them that are weaned from the milk, and drawn from the breasts. For precept must be upon precept, precept upon precept; line upon line, line upon line; here a little, and there a little.” —Isaiah 28:9-10 God is not a God of contradiction or confusion, so it’s important to not take verses out of context and build a doctrine based on a verse or two. When studying a particular topic, it’s critical to identify as many verses as possible dealing with the topic and to let the Bible clarify itself on what seem, due to our misunderstanding, like contradictory ones. What will the truth in God’s Word do to me? “Sanctify them through thy truth: thy word is truth.” —John 17:17 “But we all, with open face beholding as in a glass the glory of the LORD, are changed into the same image from glory to glory, even as by the Spirit of the LORD.” —2 Corinthians 3:18 “For the word of God is living and powerful, and sharper than any two-edged sword, piercing even to the division of soul and spirit, and of joints and marrow, and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart.” —Hebrews 4:12, NKJV Reading the Bible brings me into contact with God’s divine mind and holy character, and by beholding it daily, I become more like Him through the work of the Holy Spirit. There is a reason the book of Hebrews calls the word of God living and powerful! If I’m willing to follow God’s will, what promise do I have? “If anyone wills to do His will, he shall know concerning the doctrine, whether it is from God or whether I speak on My own authority.” —John 7:17, NKJV If I’m willing to follow it, the promise is God will reveal His truth to me.",

      "body": "What is truth? ““Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.” —John 14:6 “God is not a man, that he should lie; neither the son of man, that he should repent: hath he said, and shall he not do it? or hath he spoken, and shall he not make it good?” —Numbers 23:19 “Sanctify them through thy truth: thy word is truth.” —John 17:17 “Seeing ye have purified your souls in obeying the truth through the Spirit unto unfeigned love of the brethren, see that ye love one another with a pure heart fervently: being born again, not of corruptible seed, but of incorruptible, by the word of God, which liveth and abideth for ever. For all flesh is as grass, and all the glory of man as the flower of grass. The grass withereth, and the flower thereof falleth away: but the word of the Lord endureth for ever. And this is the word which by the gospel is preached unto you.” —1 Peter 1:22-25 Truth is personified in Jesus and revealed in His Word, the Bible. Apart from the small number who were able to see and hear it embodied in Jesus, truth is preserved for the rest of us in the Old and New Testaments. It may seem unfair, but we must remember that the majority rejected Him, not realizing that He was indeed the Messiah, the Son of God. Let us also remember the words of Jesus Himself to the unbelieving Thomas: “Because thou hast seen me, thou hast believed; blessed are they that have not seen, and yet have believed” (John 20:29). What else can we learn about truth? “Ho, every one that thirsteth, come ye to the waters, and he that hath no money; come ye, buy, and eat; yea, come, buy wine and milk without money and without price. Wherefore do ye spend money for that which is not bread? and your labour for that which satisfieth not? hearken diligently unto me, and eat ye that which is good, and let your soul delight itself in fatness. Incline your ear, and come unto me: hear, and your soul shall live; and I will make an everlasting covenant with you, even the sure mercies of David.” —Isaiah 55:1-3 “Buy the truth, and sell it not; also wisdom, and instruction, and understanding.” —Proverbs 23:23 “Again, the kingdom of heaven is like unto a merchant man, seeking goodly pearls: who, when he had found one pearl of great price, went and sold all that he had, and bought it.” —Matthew 13:45 Truth is a free gift that can be obtained “without money and without price” by the poorest and the richest; yet, because we live in a world where good and evil are at war, error and deception strive for supremacy over truth. Due to Satan’s incessant warfare against it, truth often brings reproach, inconvenience, and sacrifice into the lives of those who, having found it in God’s Word, consider it better than gold and sweeter than honey. Some are willing to sacrifice everything for it, while personal gain, convenience, or persecution causes others to abandon it. Does Jesus change? “Jesus Christ the same yesterday, and to day, and for ever.” —Hebrews 13:8 What were the Ten Commandments written on? “And he gave unto Moses, when he had made an end of communing with him upon mount Sinai, two tables of testimony, tables of stone, written with the finger of God.” —Exodus 31:18 God wrote the Ten Commandments Himself on tablets of stone to demonstrate their unchanging and eternal nature. What did Jesus declare about the law? “Think not that I am come to destroy the law, or the prophets: I am not come to destroy, but to fulfil. For verily I say unto you, till heaven and earth pass, one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law, till all be fulfilled.” —Matthew 5:17-18 “And it is easier for heaven and earth to pass, than one tittle of the law to fail.” —Luke 16:17 “My covenant will I not break, nor alter the thing that is gone out of my lips.” —Psalm 89:34 “For I am the LORD, I change not; therefore ye sons of Jacob are not consumed.” —Malachi 3:6 Since Jesus cannot change, His law cannot change either, for it reflects His holy and unchanging character. Consequently, God could not alter His holy law and still remain the infinitely holy God that He is. Moreover, if His law could have been modified, the Father would have never needed to send His Son to die for our sins on Calvary. Christ’s death stands as eternal testimony that the law is as immutable as God Himself. It is often claimed that because of Jesus’ death, we are no longer under the law but under grace. But which of the Ten Commandments do we no longer need? Since Jesus died for our sins, are we now free to have other gods, bow down to images, blaspheme God’s name, desecrate His Sabbath, dishonor our parents, murder, commit adultery, steal, lie, and covet? Of course not. Each of these commandments remains as relevant today as when they were first proclaimed on Mount Sinai. What is part of His law? When was it established? “Remember the sabbath day, to keep it holy. Six days shalt thou labour, and do all thy work: but the seventh day is the sabbath of the LORD thy God: in it thou shalt not do any work, thou, nor thy son, nor thy daughter, thy manservant, nor thy maidservant, nor thy cattle, nor thy stranger that is within thy gates: for in six days the LORD made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that in them is, and rested the seventh day: wherefore the LORD blessed the sabbath day, and hallowed it.” —Exodus 20:8-11 “Thus the heavens and the earth were finished, and all the host of them. And on the seventh day God ended his work which he had made; and he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had made. And God blessed the seventh day, and sanctified it: because that in it he had rested from all his work which God created and made.” —Genesis 2:1-3 Part of the Ten Commandments that God gave to Moses on Mount Sinai is the seventh-day Sabbath, although God sanctified the day in the very first week of creation. The fourth commandment is a monument in time—a weekly reminder of our Creator God and an opportunity to acknowledge Him as Lord of our lives. The beauty of a time-based monument is its universal accessibility to all, regardless of location, who choose to receive its blessing of rest in God. Did Jesus keep it? “And he came to Nazareth, where he had been brought up: and, as his custom was, he went into the synagogue on the sabbath day, and stood up for to read.” —Luke 4:16 “And it came to pass also on another sabbath, that he entered into the synagogue and taught: and there was a man whose right hand was withered.” —Luke 6:6 “And they went into Capernaum; and straightway on the sabbath day he entered into the synagogue, and taught.” —Mark 1:21 Was it kept after His ascension? “But when they departed from Perga, they came to Antioch in Pisidia, and went into the synagogue on the sabbath day, and sat down.” —Acts 13:14 “And when the Jews were gone out of the synagogue, the Gentiles besought that these words might be preached to them the next sabbath. Now when the congregation was broken up, many of the Jews and religious proselytes followed Paul and Barnabas: who, speaking to them, persuaded them to continue in the grace of God. And the next sabbath day came almost the whole city together to hear the word of God.” —Acts 13:42-44 “And from thence to Philippi, which is the chief city of that part of Macedonia, and a colony: and we were in that city abiding certain days. And on the sabbath we went out of the city by a river side, where prayer was wont to be made; and we sat down, and spake unto the women which resorted thither.” —Acts 16:12-13 “After these things Paul departed from Athens, and came to Corinth; … And he reasoned in the synagogue every sabbath, and persuaded the Jews and the Greeks.” —Acts 18:1,4 In the Bible, the weekly Sabbath refers to the seventh day of the week (Exodus 20:10). Scripture testifies that Jesus Himself kept it, and His apostles continued to keep it after His ascension. What warning did Paul give? “Take heed therefore unto yourselves, and to all the flock, over the which the Holy Ghost hath made you overseers, to feed the church of God, which he hath purchased with his own blood. For I know this, that after my departing shall grievous wolves enter in among you, not sparing the flock. Also of your own selves shall men arise, speaking perverse things, to draw away disciples after them. Therefore watch, and remember, that by the space of three years I ceased not to warn every one night and day with tears.” —Acts 20:28-31 Paul warned that people would arise within the church—professing to be Christians—who would speak perverse things to draw believers away from the truth. Was this prophesied in advance? “And out of one of them came forth a little horn, which waxed exceeding great, toward the south, and toward the east, and toward the pleasant land. And it waxed great, even to the host of heaven; and it cast down some of the host and of the stars to the ground, and stamped upon them. Yea, he magnified himself even to the prince of the host, and by him the daily sacrifice was taken away, and the place of his sanctuary was cast down. And an host was given him against the daily sacrifice by reason of transgression, and it cast down the truth to the ground; and it practised, and prospered.” —Daniel 8:9-12 Daniel prophesied that a power, symbolized by a little horn, would arise and exalt itself in opposition to God’s authority, trampling on the truths of the Bible. Does Daniel have additional details? “And the ten horns out of this kingdom are ten kings that shall arise: and another shall rise after them; and he shall be diverse from the first, and he shall subdue three kings. And he shall speak great words against the most High, and shall wear out the saints of the most High, and think to change times and laws: and they shall be given into his hand until a time and times and the dividing of time.” —Daniel 7:24-25 These verses echo Paul’s warning about men arising “speaking perverse things,” as it describes a religious power that would “speak great words against the most High.” This power, again symbolized by a horn, would challenge God’s authority, persecute His followers for 1,260 years, and seek to change times and laws. This is the same religious power as the one described in Daniel 8:9-12, except that in Daniel 7:24-25 it rises from among the ten tribes that divided the Roman Empire, whereas in Daniel 8 it arises out of one of the four Greek kingdoms that emerged after the death of Alexander the Great. Since the Roman religion of Mithraism was borrowed from Greece through the Kingdom of Pergamon, it is not contradictory to say that this power emerged from both the Greek and Roman Empires. In fact, Mithraism was the Persian name for Babylonian sun worship, for Mithra was the Persian god of light, who, under the Roman Empire, was identified with the sun god Sol Invictus, the invincible or unconquerable sun. This sun worship was later Christianized when Catholicism declared Sunday holy in honor of Christ’s resurrection—a day long associated with pagan sun worship, not only in Mithraism but also in the religion of ancient Babylon. Thus, there is a direct line of continuity between the religions of Babylon, Persia, Greece, Rome, and Catholicism—a progression symbolically illustrated in the image of Daniel 2. There is only one commandment that is both a law and a measure of time: the fourth. The first seeds of its alteration were planted when Constantine converted to Christianity in 312 AD, for after becoming Emperor, he granted Christian bishops influence in the legislative process. Under their guidance, he soon passed the first Sunday law in 321 AD, declaring Sunday—the pagan day of sun worship—the official day of rest across the Roman Empire. This was reinforced in 364 AD, when the Council of Laodicea urged Christians to observe Sunday as their rest day while prohibiting them from resting on Saturday. Thus, the fourth commandment of God was effectively changed—from honoring the biblical seventh-day Sabbath established at creation to observing Sunday—and the rest is history. Murl Vance, “The Counterfeit Memorial,” Signs of the Times, July 29, 1940, p. 4 The term “times” in “think to change times and laws” also applies to prophetic times—the method of prophetic interpretation in particular. The historicist method, championed by the Protestant Reformers, has largely been abandoned in favor of the preterist and futurist methods, introduced by the Roman Catholic Jesuits Luis de Alcazar and Francisco Ribera. Alcazar proposed that the prophecies of Daniel and Revelation were fulfilled in the past (preterism), while Ribera suggested they will be fulfilled in the future (futurism). Historicism, on the other hand, views prophecy as relevant throughout church history, tracing it to specific historical events, nations, and movements. The preterist and futurist methods were introduced mainly to counter the historicist method and to divert attention away from Catholicism as a major power in end-time prophetic scenarios, since historicism unequivocally identifies the Roman Catholic Church as the sea beast of Revelation 13. Did Jesus warn about this? “Thus have ye made the commandment of God of none effect by your tradition. Ye hypocrites, well did Esaias prophesy of you, saying, This people draweth nigh unto me with their mouth, and honoureth me with their lips; but their heart is far from me. But in vain they do worship me, teaching for doctrines the commandments of men.” —Matthew 15:6-9 The elevation of human-made commandments and traditions above the truth of the Bible was already a problem in Jesus’ time, and He warned against it. Why? Because it is idolatry. Idolatry is traditionally defined as the worship of idols—human-made images. In the same way, Sunday sacredness is a human-made tradition. Just as God did not create the sun as an object of worship, He did not establish the first day as a day of worship; therefore, there is no real difference between worshiping the object and venerating the day. He also did not rest on Sunday. The Sabbath commemorates God’s rest on the seventh day, so Sunday cannot be the “new” Sabbath for the simple reason that He did not rest on that day. We never celebrate a friend’s birthday or a couple’s wedding anniversary on the day it did not occur, because these dates are historical, not arbitrary. Just as we cannot change the day we were born or married, we cannot change the day on which God rested. The same principle applies to Christmas—the supposed birth of Christ on December 25. It is highly unlikely that He was born at that time, since shepherds would not have been out in the fields watching their sheep in the middle of winter. Like Sunday, the date was associated with the sun in paganism. Its placement shortly after the winter solstice—the shortest day of the year—is a significant clue that it originally celebrated the sun’s “rebirth,” as the days slowly began to grow longer. What else was changed besides the fourth commandment? “And he shall speak great words against the most High, and shall wear out the saints of the most High, and think to change times and laws: and they shall be given into his hand until a time and times and the dividing of time.” —Daniel 7:25 The word “laws” is plural, and indeed the Sabbath commandment was not the only one that was changed. The Catholic Church removed the second commandment, which prohibits the worship of images, and divided the tenth commandment into two. However, it is the alteration of the fourth commandment that stands out most, because the Sabbath is the mark of God’s authority, identifying Him as the Creator. To alter it, therefore, is to directly challenge God’s authority. This naturally raises the following question: What is the Catholic Church’s mark of authority? Incidentally, Catholicism teaches that the pope is infallible when he speaks ex cathedra—from his authoritative position—yet at the same time asserts that God, the Creator of all, could somehow alter His own divine law. How can this be? What is the Catholic Church’s mark of authority? “Now in the matter of Sabbath observance the Protestant rule of Faith is utterly unable to explain the substitution of the Christian Sunday for the Jewish Saturday. It has been changed. The Bible still teaches that the Sabbath or Saturday should be kept holy. There is no authority in the New Testament for the substitution of Sunday for Saturday. Surely it is an important matter. It stands there in the Bible as one of the Ten Commandments of God. There is no authority in the Bible for abrogating this Commandment, or for transferring its observance to another day of the week. … ““We have in the authoritative voice of the Church the voice of Christ Himself. The Church is above the Bible; and this transference of Sabbath observance from Saturday to Sunday is proof positive of that fact. Deny the authority of the Church and you have no adequate or reasonable explanation or justification for the substitution of Sunday for Saturday in the Third—Protestant Fourth—Commandment of God.” —\"Sabbath Observance,\" The Catholic Record, September 1, 1923, p. 4. “Of course the Catholic Church claims that the change was her act. It could not have been otherwise, as none in those days would have dreamed of doing anything, in matters spiritual, ecclesiastical and religious without her. This act is a mark of her ecclesiastical power and authority in religious matters.” —C. F. Thomas, Chancellor of Cardinal Gibbons, letter, October 28, 1895. “The Church changed the observance of the Sabbath to Sunday by right of the divine, infallible authority given to her by her founder, Jesus Christ. The Protestant, claiming the Bible to be the only guide of faith, has no warrant for observing Sunday. In this matter the Seventh-day Adventist is the only consistent Protestant.” —The Catholic Universe Bulletin, August 14, 1942, p. 4. “If Protestants would follow the Bible, they would worship God on the Sabbath Day. In keeping the Sunday they are following a law of the Catholic Church.” —Albert Smith, Chancellor of Cardinal Gibbons, letter, February 10, 1920. “My brethren, look about you upon the various wrangling sects and denominations. Show me one that claims, or possesses the power to make laws binding on the conscience. There’s but one on the face of the earth—the Catholic Church—that has the power to make laws binding upon the conscience, binding before God, binding under pain of hell fire. Take for instance the day we celebrate—Sunday. What right have the Protestant churches to observe that, day? None whatever. … Sunday is not the Sabbath according to the Bible and the record of time. Every one knows that Sunday is the first day of the week, while Saturday is the seventh day and the Sabbath, the day consecrated as a day of rest. It is so recognized in all civilized nations. ““I have repeatedly offered $1000 to any one who will furnish any proof from the Bible that Sunday is the day we are bound to keep, and no one has called for the money. If any person in this town will show me any scripture for it I will, tomorrow evening, publicly acknowledge it and thank him for it. It was the holy Catholic Church that changed the day of rest from Saturday to Sunday, the first day of the week. And it not only compelled all to keep Sunday, but at the Council of Laodicea, A. D. 364, anathematized those who kept the Sabbath and urged all persons to labor on the seventh day under the penalty of anathema. ““Which church does the whole civilized world obey? Protestants … profess great reverence for the Bible, and yet by their solemn act of keeping Sunday they acknowledge the power of the Catholic Church. The Bible says, ‘Remember the Sabbath day, to keep it holy,’ but the Catholic Church says, ‘No, keep the first day of the week,’ and the whole world bows in obedience.” —Catholic Priest T. Enright, lecture at Harlan, Iowa, December 15, 1889. What question does the papacy ask Protestants? “Protestants have repeatedly asked the papacy, “How could you dare to change God’s law?” But the question posed to Protestants by the Catholic church is even more penetrating. ““Here it is officially: You will tell me that Saturday was the Jewish Sabbath, but that the Christian Sabbath has been changed to Sunday. Changed! but by whom? Who has authority to change an express commandment of Almighty God? When God has spoken and said, Thou shalt keep holy the seventh day, who shall dare to say, Nay, thou mayest work and do all manner of worldly business on the seventh day; but thou shalt keep holy the first day in its stead? ““This is a most important question, which I know not how you can answer. You are a Protestant, and you profess to go by the Bible and the Bible only; and yet in so important a matter as the observance of one day in seven as a holy day, you go against the plain letter of the Bible, and put another day in the place of that day which the Bible has commanded. ““The command to keep holy the seventh day is one of the ten commandments; you believe that the other nine are still binding; who gave you authority to tamper with the fourth? If you are consistent with your own principles, if you really follow the Bible and the Bible only, you ought to be able to produce some portion of the New Testament in which this fourth commandment is expressly altered. {% ct \"Library of Christian Doctrine: Why Don't You Keep Holy the Sabbath-Day? (London: Burns and Oates, Ltd.), pp. 3, 4.\" %} How many lawgivers are there? “There is one lawgiver, who is able to save and to destroy: who art thou that judgest another?” —James 4:12 There is only one Lawgiver—God. Yet we have learned that there exists a religious power claiming to be a lawgiver as well, one that considers itself justified in altering the law of God Himself, thereby placing its authority above His (2 Thessalonians 2:3-4). Jesus warned, “And fear not them which kill the body, but are not able to kill the soul: but rather fear him [God] which is able to destroy both soul and body in hell” (Matthew 10:28). The Church can kill the body (as it did to millions during the Dark Ages), but God has power to raise it from the dead (1 Thessalonians 4:16; 1 Corinthians 15:52). Whom, then, would you rather obey? “Reason and sense demand the acceptance of one or the other of these alternatives: either Protestantism and the keeping holy of Saturday, or Catholicity and the keeping holy of Sunday. Compromise is impossible.” —John Cardinal Gibbons, The Catholic Mirror, December 23, 1893. What role will the law play in the last days? “And after these things I saw four angels standing on the four corners of the earth, holding the four winds of the earth, that the wind should not blow on the earth, nor on the sea, nor on any tree. And I saw another angel ascending from the east, having the seal of the living God: and he cried with a loud voice to the four angels, to whom it was given to hurt the earth and the sea, saying, Hurt not the earth, neither the sea, nor the trees, till we have sealed the servants of our God in their foreheads.” —Revelation 7:1-3 “Bind up the testimony, seal the law among my disciples.” —Isaiah 8:16 “Nevertheless the foundation of God standeth sure, having this seal, The Lord knoweth them that are his. And, Let every one that nameth the name of Christ depart from iniquity.” —2 Timothy 2:19 In the last days, there will be a sealing of God’s people in their foreheads, which, according to Isaiah and 2 Timothy, refers to God’s law, for sin (iniquity) is the transgression of His law (1 John 3:4). When God’s people are sealed, they make an unwavering decision to honor the authority of His law as supreme—above the laws of men—no matter the cost. Their hearts are so knit with their Father’s that they would rather die than disobey their Maker (Revelation 12:11). This is not a works-based, legalistic religion, but a love-driven loyalty—by His grace through faith—to the One who risked all to save us. It is a faith that works. To the truly converted person who has been born again, keeping God’s law is not a burden but a delight (1 John 5:3; Psalm 40:8). It is noteworthy that in the Bible, God’s Ten Commandments are linked with His name (Deuteronomy 28:9-10; Revelation 14:1, 12) because they reflect His character. Therefore, God’s servants being sealed in their foreheads is synonymous with His name being written there (Revelation 14:1; 22:4). The harlot who rides the beast in Revelation 17:5 also bears a name on her forehead that stands in direct contrast to God’s holy name: “MYSTERY, BABYLON THE GREAT, THE MOTHER OF HARLOTS AND ABOMINATIONS OF THE EARTH”. Why is the name written on the forehead? Paul explains in Philippians 2:5, “Let this mind be in you, which was also in Christ Jesus.” To be sealed with His name is to possess His mind—a mind that delights to do the Father’s will, as revealed in His law (John 8:29). This is accomplished only by faith in God’s promises (Jeremiah 31:33; Ephesians 2:8) and through the transforming power of the Holy Spirit working in us (Titus 3:5). Those who are sealed with His name are clothed with the righteousness of Christ, symbolized in Revelation by the white robe washed in the blood of the Lamb and freely offered to all (Revelation 7:9, 14; 3:18). Jesus asks each of us, “Wilt thou be made whole?” (John 5:6). Do we have the faith of the leper who said to Him, “Lord, if thou wilt, thou canst make me clean” (Matthew 8:2)? If we do, Jesus will cleanse us—immediately—from the guilt, shame, and defilement of sin. “And Jesus put forth his hand, and touched him, saying, I will; be thou clean. And immediately his leprosy was cleansed.” —Matthew 8:3 If our faith is lacking, we can exercise the faith we do have as we ask for more: “Lord, I believe; help thou mine unbelief” (Mark 9:24). What is said about the saints? “Saying with a loud voice, Fear God, and give glory to him; for the hour of his judgment is come: and worship him that made heaven, and earth, and the sea, and the fountains of waters. … Here is the patience of the saints: here are they that keep the commandments of God, and the faith of Jesus.” —Revelation 14:7, 12 The final invitation in the last days to worship God includes a reference to the latter part of the fourth commandment, which identifies the Sabbath as the sign that God is the Creator of all. Those who respond to this call will be sealed with His law, of which the seventh-day Sabbath is the distinguishing sign. The call to worship God implies that another power will also seek worship, bearing its own counterfeit seal—the altered Ten Commandments—of which Sunday will be the mark. Just as God used the eating of a tree to test Adam and Eve in Eden, so He will use the observance of a day to test the final generation living on earth. Revelation 14:12 leaves no room for doubt, declaring that the saints will, by God’s grace, keep His commandments and the faith of Jesus.",

Then said his disciples, Lord, if he sleep, he shall do well. Howbeit Jesus spake of his death: but they thought that he had spoken of taking of rest in sleep. Then said Jesus unto them plainly, Lazarus is dead.” —John 11:11-14 Will there be a resurrection? “For this we say unto you by the word of the Lord, that we which are alive and remain unto the coming of the Lord shall not prevent them which are asleep. For the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the archangel, and with the trump of God: and the dead in Christ shall rise first.” —1 Thessalonians 4:15-16 “I am he that liveth, and was dead; and, behold, I am alive for evermore, amen; and have the keys of hell and of death.” —Revelation 1:18 Jesus uses the state of sleep as a metaphor for death because He knows there will be a resurrection at the second coming. This will be a resurrection of those who died in Christ because He was the only One who conquered death. Will there be a second resurrection? “Marvel not at this: for the hour is coming, in the which all that are in the graves shall hear his voice, and shall come forth; they that have done good, unto the resurrection of life; and they that have done evil, unto the resurrection of damnation.” —John 5:28-29 John makes it clear there will be two resurrections for two different groups of people: those who, through the grace of Christ, reflected goodness in their life will be part of the resurrection of life, which takes place at the second coming of Jesus, while those who lived unrighteous lives will be part of the resurrection of damnation. How did God form the first human? “And the LORD God formed man of the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soul.” —Genesis 2:7 God made man by forming him from the dust of the ground and breathing into him the breath of life. In other words, dust (the body) plus breath of God equals a living soul. What happens when a person dies? “Then shall the dust return to the earth as it was: and the spirit shall return unto God who gave it.” —Ecclesiastes 12:7 When a person dies, the body returns to dust, and the spirit returns to God. What is the spirit that returns to God? “All the while my breath is in me, and the spirit of God is in my nostrils.” —Job 27:3 “For as the body without the spirit is dead, so faith without works is dead also.” —James 2:26 The spirit that returns to God is simply the breath of life, without which the body dies. In other words, the process described in Ecclesiastes 12:7 is the opposite of what happened in Genesis 2:7. If a soul is a combination of two things—the body and the breath of life (spirit)—then the soul ceases to exist when the body returns to dust and the breath returns to God. The soul does not go anywhere; it simply ceases to exist. As an illustration, consider what is needed for light: there needs to be an electrical current and a bulb. As soon as the electrical current is turned off, the light simply ceases to exist. It is the same with the soul. What else does the Bible about the soul? “Behold, all souls are mine; as the soul of the father, so also the soul of the son is mine: the soul that sinneth, it shall die.” —Ezekiel 18:4 “For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.” —Romans 6:23 “For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God.” —Romans 3:23 A person’s soul or spirit does not go to heaven or hell at death, for the Bible plainly declares, “The soul that sinneth, it shall die.” Why is this so? Because the wages of sin are death, and all have sinned. Moreover, before His ascension, Jesus assured His disciples, “I will come again, and receive you unto Myself” (John 14:2-3). Notice that He did not say they would come to Him at death, but rather that He would come to them at His Second Coming. Where is King David now? “Men and brethren, let me freely speak unto you of the patriarch David, that he is both dead and buried, and his sepulchre is with us unto this day. … For David is not ascended into the heavens: but he saith himself, The LORD said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand.” —Acts 2:29, 34 Is conscious thought possible after death? “Put not your trust in princes, nor in the son of man, in whom there is no help. His breath goeth forth, he returneth to his earth; in that very day his thoughts perish.” —Psalm 146:3-4 Since the spirit is simply the breath then it is not possible for the spirit to exist after death. Here the psalmist describes the same process of death that was described in the previous verses: the breath leaving the body and returning to God who gave it, the body returning to dust (the earth), and when these two things happen all conscious thought ceases to exist. Can the dead praise God? “The dead praise not the LORD, neither any that go down into silence.” —Psalm 115:17 Do dead people remember anything? “For in death there is no remembrance of thee: in the grave who shall give thee thanks?” —Psalm 6:5 “For the living know that they shall die: but the dead know not any thing, neither have they any more a reward; for the memory of them is forgotten. Also their love, and their hatred, and their envy, is now perished; neither have they any more a portion for ever in any thing that is done under the sun.” —Ecclesiastes 9:5-6 Who has immortality? “That thou keep this commandment without spot, unrebukeable, until the appearing of our Lord Jesus Christ: which in his times he shall shew, who is the blessed and only Potentate, the King of kings, and Lord of lords; who only hath immortality, dwelling in the light which no man can approach unto; whom no man hath seen, nor can see: to whom be honour and power everlasting.” —1 Timothy 6:14-16 “Shall mortal man be more just than God? shall a man be more pure than his maker?” —Job 4:17 Man is fully mortal; only God is immortal. This idea that the soul is immortal stems from the Garden of Eden where Satan told Eve she would surely not die (Genesis 3:4), even though God clearly said that sin brings death (Genesis 2:17). Who else will inherit immortality? “To them who by patient continuance in well doing seek for glory and honour and immortality, eternal life.” —Romans 2:7 “For the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the archangel, and with the trump of God: and the dead in Christ shall rise first: then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air: and so shall we ever be with the Lord.” —1 Thessalonians 4:16-17 “Behold, I shew you a mystery; we shall not all sleep, but we shall all be changed, in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trump: for the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed. For this corruptible must put on incorruption, and this mortal must put on immortality. So when this corruptible shall have put on incorruption, and this mortal shall have put on immortality, then shall be brought to pass the saying that is written, Death is swallowed up in victory.” —1 Corinthians 15:51-54 1 Corinthians 15 says that not all the righteous will experience death, but all the righteous will be changed when the trumpet of God sounds at the second coming. In other words, the righteous who are live to see the second coming, as well as those who died in Christ, who will at that moment be resurrected, will receive new, immortal bodies. From that point on death will never have power over them because Jesus defeated it, and by accepting His sacrifice on their behalf, they will inherit His victory over it! What hope did Job have about the resurrection? “For I know that my redeemer liveth, and that he shall stand at the latter day upon the earth: and though after my skin worms destroy this body, yet in my flesh shall I see God.” —Job 19:25-26 “Who shall change our vile body, that it may be fashioned like unto his glorious body, according to the working whereby he is able even to subdue all things unto himself.” —Philippians 3:21 Because Jesus, His Redeemer, conquered death, Job will one day be able to see Him in a glorious, new, physical body. What about Luke 23:43? “And Jesus said unto him, Verily I say unto thee, today shalt thou be with me in paradise.” —Luke 23:43 “Jesus saith unto her, Touch me not; for I am not yet ascended to my Father: but go to my brethren, and say unto them, I ascend unto my Father, and your Father; and to my God, and your God.” —John 20:17 Jesus could not have gone to heaven after His death because on Sunday morning He told Mary He hadn’t yet ascended to His Father. It’s a little know fact, but the original Bible text did not have any punctuation. It was added centuries later by translators who could have placed the comma before the word “today” due to their own beliefs about death. The better place for the comma would be after the word “today” because then it would be in harmony with all the other Bible texts regarding death. Jesus was promising the thief on the cross that day—when it did not look like He could save anyone—that he would be with Him in Paradise one day when He returns to take all of His children home to heaven. Who did Saul see in Endor then? “And the king said unto her, Be not afraid: for what sawest thou? And the woman said unto Saul, I saw gods ascending out of the earth. And he said unto her, What form is he of? And she said, An old man cometh up; and he is covered with a mantle. And Saul perceived that it was Samuel, and he stooped with his face to the ground, and bowed himself.” —1 Samuel 28:13-14 “As the cloud is consumed and vanisheth away: so he that goeth down to the grave shall come up no more. He shall return no more to his house, neither shall his place know him any more.” —Job 7:9-10 “And there came forth a spirit, and stood before the LORD, and said, I will persuade him. And the LORD said unto him, Wherewith? And he said, I will go forth, and I will be a lying spirit in the mouth of all his prophets. And he said, Thou shalt persuade him, and prevail also: go forth, and do so.” —1 Kings 22:21-22 “For they are the spirits of devils, working miracles, which go forth unto the kings of the earth and of the whole world, to gather them to the battle of that great day of God Almighty.” —Revelation 16:14 It could not have been Samuel that Saul saw because the Bible is clear that the dead remain dead until the resurrection. In Revelation we learn that the devil has fallen angels whom he was able to persuade to join his rebellion in heaven, and after he was cast to earth, they were cast down with him (Revelation 12:4). In other places, they are called “lying spirits” and “spirits of devils” who have the power to work miracles, including masquerading as human beings. In fact, Satan Himself is able to appear as an angel of light (2 Corinthians 11:14). Saul saw one of these spirits masquerading as Samuel. What does the Bible say about communication with spirits? “Do not turn to mediums or spiritists; do not seek them out to be defiled by them. I am the LORD your God.” —Leviticus 19:31, NASB “There shall not be found among you any one that maketh his son or his daughter to pass through the fire, or that useth divination, or an observer of times, or an enchanter, or a witch, or a charmer, or a consulter with familiar spirits, or a wizard, or a necromancer. For all that do these things are an abomination unto the LORD: and because of these abominations the LORD thy God doth drive them out from before thee.” —Deuteronomy 18:10-12 “Now the Spirit speaketh expressly, that in the latter times some shall depart from the faith, giving heed to seducing spirits, and doctrines of devils.” —1 Timothy 4:1 “And when they say to you, “Seek those who are mediums and wizards, who whisper and mutter,” should not a people seek their God? Should they seek the dead on behalf of the living? To the law and to the testimony! If they do not speak according to this word, it is because there is no light in them.” —Isaiah 8:19-20, NKJV Communication with spirits is forbidden in the Bible because it’s an abomination to God. Paul also warns that this practice is one of the signs of the last days, and it will lead to deception and a departure from the faith, meaning it will be practiced by those who claim to be believers. Isaiah says that the only way to identify whether a spirit is from God or not is to compare what it says with the Word of God because every lying spirit will speak contrary to His Word. What did Paul write at the end of his life? “I have fought a good fight, I have finished my course, I have kept the faith: henceforth there is laid up for me a crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous judge, shall give me at that day: and not to me only, but unto all them also that love his appearing.” —2 Timothy 4:7-8 May the grace of Jesus help us to live a life of unwavering commitment and faithfulness to Him.",

What does it mean? “Behold, a virgin shall be with child, and shall bring forth a son, and they shall call his name Emmanuel, which being interpreted is, God with us.” —Matthew 1:23 Does John confirm Jesus’ divinity? “In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. &hellip; And the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us, and we beheld his glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father, full of grace and truth.” —John 1:1, 14 What did Jesus say about His divinity? “And now, O Father, glorify thou me with thine own self with the glory which I had with thee before the world was. … Father, I will that they also, whom thou hast given me, be with me where I am; that they may behold my glory, which thou hast given me: for thou lovedst me before the foundation of the world.” —John 17:5, 24 The Father shares His glory with His Son, Jesus, and it has always been this way. What other claim did Jesus make? “Jesus said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Before Abraham was, I am.” —John 8:58 Why is this claim significant? “And God said unto Moses, “I AM THAT I AM”: and he said, “Thus shalt thou say unto the children of Israel, ‘I AM hath sent me unto you.’”” —Exodus 3:14 Jesus used this expression to reveal Himself to Moses as “the Self-existing One.” It mirrors another of God’s names, Yahweh, which comes from a Hebrew word meaning “to be” or “to exist.” He’s telling Moses that He has no beginning or end. Does Paul corroborate this? “For by him were all things created, that are in heaven, and that are in earth, visible and invisible, whether they be thrones, or dominions, or principalities, or powers: all things were created by him, and for him: and he is before all things, and by him all things consist.” —Colossians 1:16-17 Not only is Jesus the Self-existing One, but He is also the Creator of all things! What is another sign of Jesus’ divinity? “And when he saw their faith, he said unto him, Man, thy sins are forgiven thee. And the scribes and the Pharisees began to reason, saying, Who is this which speaketh blasphemies? Who can forgive sins, but God alone? But when Jesus perceived their thoughts, he answering said unto them, What reason ye in your hearts? Whether is easier, to say, Thy sins be forgiven thee; or to say, Rise up and walk? But that ye may know that the Son of man hath power upon earth to forgive sins, (he said unto the sick of the palsy,) I say unto thee, Arise, and take up thy couch, and go into thine house.” —Luke 5:20-24 Because He is God, Jesus has the power to forgive sins. What did Thomas call Jesus? “And Thomas answered and said unto him, My Lord and my God.” —John 20:28 Do the angels worship Jesus? What does the Father call Him? “For unto which of the angels said he at any time, “Thou art my Son, this day have I begotten thee?” And again, “I will be to him a Father, and he shall be to me a Son?” And again, when he bringeth in the firstbegotten into the world, he saith, “And let all the angels of God worship him.” And of the angels he saith, “Who maketh his angels spirits, and his ministers a flame of fire.” But unto the Son he saith, “Thy throne, O God, is for ever and ever: a sceptre of righteousness is the sceptre of thy kingdom. Thou hast loved righteousness, and hated iniquity; therefore God, even thy God, hath anointed thee with the oil of gladness above thy fellows.”” —Hebrews 1:5-9 Not only do the angels in heaven worship Jesus, but the Father Himself calls Him God. What is one of the names given to Jesus in Isaiah 9? “For unto us a child is born, unto us a son is given: and the government shall be upon his shoulder: and his name shall be called Wonderful, Counseller, The mighty God, The everlasting Father, The Prince of Peace.” —Isaiah 9:6 What does Micah say about Jesus? “But thou, Bethlehem Ephratah, though thou be little among the thousands of Judah, yet out of thee shall he come forth unto me that is to be ruler in Israel; whose goings forth have been from of old, from everlasting.” —Micah 5:2 This Messianic prophecy is another echo of Jesus being “the Self-existing One.” Does Paul affirm Jesus’ divinity? “For in him dwelleth all the fulness of the Godhead bodily.” —Colossians 2:9 “Which in his times he shall shew, who is the blessed and only Potentate, the King of kings, and Lord of lords; who only hath immortality, dwelling in the light which no man can approach unto; whom no man hath seen, nor can see: to whom be honour and power everlasting.” —1 Timothy 6:15-16 Jesus “dwelling in unapproachable light” is a reference to His divinity, glory, and holiness, which no man can see and live. What claim does Jesus make in Revelation? “I am he that liveth, and was dead; and, behold, I am alive for evermore, amen; and have the keys of hell and of death.” —Revelation 1:18 Death could not conquer Jesus because it has no power over Him who is God. Does Paul have anything else to say about Jesus? “Let this mind be in you, which was also in Christ Jesus: who, being in the form of God, thought it not robbery to be equal with God: but made himself of no reputation, and took upon him the form of a servant, and was made in the likeness of men: and being found in fashion as a man, he humbled himself, and became obedient unto death, even the death of the cross. Wherefore God also hath highly exalted him, and given him a name which is above every name: that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of things in heaven, and things in earth, and things under the earth; and that every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father. Wherefore, my beloved, as ye have always obeyed, not as in my presence only, but now much more in my absence, work out your own salvation with fear and trembling.” —Philippians 2:5-12 Because Jesus is God and is equal with God, the Father, there will come a day when every human being will bow before Him and confess that He is Lord.",

      "body": "What promise did Jesus make about heaven? “Let not your heart be troubled: ye believe in God, believe also in me. In my Father’s house are many mansions: if it were not so, I would have told you. I go to prepare a place for you. And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again, and receive you unto myself; that where I am, there ye may be also.” —John 14:1-3 After His resurrection, Jesus returned to heaven to prepare it for His children’s arrival, and a day will come when He will return for them in order to bring them to heaven and dwell with Him for all eternity. What insight does Peter give? “But the day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night; in the which the heavens shall pass away with a great noise, and the elements shall melt with fervent heat, the earth also and the works that are therein shall be burned up. Seeing then that all these things shall be dissolved, what manner of persons ought ye to be in all holy conversation and godliness, looking for and hasting unto the coming of the day of God, wherein the heavens being on fire shall be dissolved, and the elements shall melt with fervent heat? Nevertheless we, according to his promise, look for new heavens and a new earth, wherein dwelleth righteousness.” —2 Peter 3:10-13 Unlike life on earth now, heaven will be a place where righteousness dwells. Sin and its consequences will be forever abolished. What kind of people will be there? “Blessed are the poor in spirit: for theirs is the kingdom of heaven. Blessed are they that mourn: for they shall be comforted. Blessed are the meek: for they shall inherit the earth. Blessed are they which do hunger and thirst after righteousness: for they shall be filled. Blessed are the merciful: for they shall obtain mercy. Blessed are the pure in heart: for they shall see God. Blessed are the peacemakers: for they shall be called the children of God. Blessed are they which are persecuted for righteousness’ sake: for theirs is the kingdom of heaven. Blessed are ye, when men shall revile you, and persecute you, and shall say all manner of evil against you falsely, for my sake. Rejoice, and be exceeding glad: for great is your reward in heaven: for so persecuted they the prophets which were before you.” —Matthew 5:3-12 “Jesus answered and said unto him, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God. Nicodemus saith unto him, How can a man be born when he is old? can he enter the second time into his mother’s womb, and be born? Jesus answered, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born of water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God.” —John 3:3 No one is born pure in heart, hungering and thirsting after rigtheousness because all have sinned (Romans 3:23). This is why Jesus said that no one can see the kingdom of God without being born again of the Spirit. So even though all have sinned, some, after learning about the love of Jesus, choose to put an end to the rebellion against Him in their lives. They make peace with Him by reaching out and taking His hand of mercy that offers forgiveness and imparts grace into their lives, restoring them into His image and fitting them for heaven. They surrender their hearts to Him and become the blessed ones of Matthew 5 who have been transformed by His love and made citizens of His kingdom (Philippians 3:20). What will it be like? “And I saw a new heaven and a new earth: for the first heaven and the first earth were passed away; and there was no more sea. And I John saw the holy city, new Jerusalem, coming down from God out of heaven, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband. And I heard a great voice out of heaven saying, Behold, the tabernacle of God is with men, and he will dwell with them, and they shall be his people, and God himself shall be with them, and be their God. And God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes; and there shall be no more death, neither sorrow, nor crying, neither shall there be any more pain: for the former things are passed away. And he that sat upon the throne said, Behold, I make all things new. And he said unto me, Write: for these words are true and faithful.” —Revelation 21:1-5 “And there shall be no more curse: but the throne of God and of the Lamb shall be in it; and his servants shall serve him: and they shall see his face; and his name shall be in their foreheads.” —Revelation 22:3-4 “For thus saith the LORD that created the heavens; God himself that formed the earth and made it; he hath established it, he created it not in vain, he formed it to be inhabited: I am the LORD; and there is none else.” —Isaiah 45:18 “And thou, O tower of the flock, the strong hold of the daughter of Zion, unto thee shall it come, even the first dominion; the kingdom shall come to the daughter of Jerusalem.” —Micah 4:8 As one of the most hope-filled passages in the entire Bible, (Revelation 21:3-4) adds a lot more color to what Peter meant when he said that righteousness will dwell there. And because sin and its curse will be abolished (Genesis 3:17-19), God will be able to dwell among His children, never to be separated again! They will be able to commune with Him the way Adam and Eve did before sin entered the world: face-to-face! These passages also tell us that God did not create earth just to watch it be destroyed by sin. No, He will abolish sin, recreate earth, and make it even more glorious than it was in Eden! He will do the work which Adam, Eve, and their offspring would have done had they never sinned—to populate and build up the earth (Genesis 1:28). God will fill the earth with the people He redeemed, and He will establish the New Jerusalem as its capital! What kind of bodies will the saved have? “Who shall change our vile body, that it may be fashioned like unto his glorious body, according to the working whereby he is able even to subdue all things unto himself.” —Philippians 3:21 “Behold my hands and my feet, that it is I myself: handle me, and see; for a spirit hath not flesh and bones, as ye see me have.” —Luke 24:39 “Strengthen ye the weak hands, and confirm the feeble knees. Say to them that are of a fearful heart, Be strong, fear not: behold, your God will come with vengeance, even God with a recompence; he will come and save you. Then the eyes of the blind shall be opened, and the ears of the deaf shall be unstopped. Then shall the lame man leap as a hart, and the tongue of the dumb sing: for in the wilderness shall waters break out, and streams in the desert.” —Isaiah 35:3-6 The saved will no longer have their mortal, earthly bodies because at Christ’s second coming they will receive new, immortal, and glorious bodies, like the body of Jesus, free from any trace of disease, abnormality, or blemish. Jesus had a real, physical body after His resurrection, and the saved will have a real, physical body in heaven too. Will the sorrows of earth taint the joy of heaven? “For, behold, I create new heavens and a new earth: and the former shall not be remembered, nor come into mind.” —Isaiah 65:17 What will the saved be doing there? “And they shall build houses, and inhabit them; and they shall plant vineyards, and eat the fruit of them. They shall not build, and another inhabit; they shall not plant, and another eat: for as the days of a tree are the days of my people, and mine elect shall long enjoy the work of their hands. They shall not labour in vain, nor bring forth for trouble; for they are the seed of the blessed of the LORD, and their offspring with them.” —Isaiah 65:21-23 “And I say unto you, That many shall come from the east and west, and shall sit down with Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, in the kingdom of heaven.” —Matthew 8:11 In addition to having a mansion in the New Jerusalem built by Jesus (John 14:1-3), the saved will also build their own homes and plant their own vineyards. Real people will be doing real things, and they will be enjoying the fruit of their labor, unlike on earth where hard work can end in disappointment, theft, or sudden destruction. The saved will also have the blessing of friendship and fellowship with one another, including the heroes of the Bible! Will there be predation and killing? “The wolf and the lamb shall feed together, and the lion shall eat straw like the bullock: and dust shall be the serpent’s meat. They shall not hurt nor destroy in all my holy mountain, saith the LORD.” —Isaiah 65:25 “The wolf will live with the lamb, and the leopard will lie down with the goat; the calf and young lion and fatling will be together, and a little child will lead them. The cow will graze with the bear, their young will lie down together, and the lion will eat straw like the ox. The infant will play by the cobra’s den, and the toddler will reach into the viper’s nest. They will neither harm nor destroy on all My holy mountain, for the earth will be full of the knowledge of the LORD as the sea is full of water.” —Isaiah 11:6-9 There will be no death in heaven, which means no predatory behavior either. What else will be different there? “And I saw a new heaven and a new earth: for the first heaven and the first earth were passed away; and there was no more sea.” —Revelation 21:1 “The wilderness and the solitary place shall be glad for them; and the desert shall rejoice, and blossom as the rose.” —Isaiah 35:1 “And there shall be no night there; and they need no candle, neither light of the sun; for the Lord God giveth them light: and they shall reign for ever and ever.” —Revelation 22:5 “But they that wait upon the LORD shall renew their strength; they shall mount up with wings as eagles; they shall run, and not be weary; and they shall walk, and not faint.” —Isaiah 40:31 “And there shall in no wise enter into it any thing that defileth, neither whatsoever worketh abomination, or maketh a lie: but they which are written in the Lamb’s book of life.” —Revelation 21:27 “Violence shall no more be heard in thy land, wasting nor destruction within thy borders; but thou shalt call thy walls Salvation, and thy gates Praise. The sun shall be no more thy light by day; neither for brightness shall the moon give light unto thee: but the LORD shall be unto thee an everlasting light, and thy God thy glory. Thy sun shall no more go down; neither shall thy moon withdraw itself: for the LORD shall be thine everlasting light, and the days of thy mourning shall be ended. Thy people also shall be all righteous: they shall inherit the land for ever, the branch of my planting, the work of my hands, that I may be glorified.” —Isaiah 60:18-21 Vast oceans and deserts make up a large portion of the earth’s surface today, but that will no longer be the case in heaven. There will also be no night there because the brightness of God’s presence will permeate the whole earth. There will be no weariness after hard work, and the saved will be able to fly like the angels, maybe even visiting other unfallen worlds created by God (Job 1:6; Hebrews 1:2; 11:3)! No destruction means there will be no natural disasters. And because heaven is a place where righteousness dwells, there will be nothing there that defiles, meaning no deception, no crime, no drunkenness, no brothels, no abuse, nor any other impurity. The righteous will be clothed with the righteousness of Jesus and will reflect His character of love! What will the New Jerusalem be like? “And the city lieth foursquare, and the length is as large as the breadth: and he measured the city with the reed, twelve thousand furlongs. The length and the breadth and the height of it are equal. And he measured the wall thereof, an hundred and forty and four cubits, according to the measure of a man, that is, of the angel.” —Revelation 21:16-17 “And the building of the wall of it was of jasper: and the city was pure gold, like unto clear glass. And the foundations of the wall of the city were garnished with all manner of precious stones. The first foundation was jasper; the second, sapphire; the third, a chalcedony; the fourth, an emerald; the fifth, sardonyx; the sixth, sardius; the seventh, chrysolite; the eighth, beryl; the ninth, a topaz; the tenth, a chrysoprasus; the eleventh, a jacinth; the twelfth, an amethyst. And the twelve gates were twelve pearls; every several gate was of one pearl: and the street of the city was pure gold, as it were transparent glass.” —Revelation 21:18-21 The city is arranged in a square with its width, length, and height equal. The distance around it is 12,000 furlongs or 1,500 miles (1 furlong is 1/8 of a mile), which means it’s 375 miles long each side! The streets are of pure gold, and the walls are 144 cubits or 216 feet of solid jasper—nearly 20 stories high—with 12 gates total, and each gate is of a single pearl. The city also has 12 foundations with each one of a different precious stone and color, so from a distance it will look like it’s resting upon a rainbow! When the New Jerusalem descends from heaven at the end of the 1,000 years, it will rest on a great plain created for it by Jesus after He flattens the Mount of Olives (Zechariah 14:4-5). What about the food and water supply? “And he shewed me a pure river of water of life, clear as crystal, proceeding out of the throne of God and of the Lamb. In the midst of the street of it, and on either side of the river, was there the tree of life, which bare twelve manner of fruits, and yielded her fruit every month: and the leaves of the tree were for the healing of the nations.” —Revelation 22:1-2 The city is watered by the river of life that flows from the throne of God, while the tree of life produces a different kind of fruit each month! In addition to this, the saved will also plant their own food at the homes they build (Isaiah 65:21). Since there will be no death there, the diet will be what it was before Adam and Eve sinned: fruits, grains, and nuts (Gensis 1:29). Sustained by the fruit and leaves of the tree of life, the saved will experience unfailing youth and vigor throughout eternity! What does Paul say about the glory of heaven? “But as it is written, Eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither have entered into the heart of man, the things which God hath prepared for them that love him.” —1 Corinthians 2:9 “For I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us.” —Romans 8:18 “For which cause we faint not; but though our outward man perish, yet the inward man is renewed day by day. For our light affliction, which is but for a moment, worketh for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory; while we look not at the things which are seen, but at the things which are not seen: for the things which are seen are temporal; but the things which are not seen are eternal.” —2 Corinthians 4:16-18 The joy, bliss, and glory of heaven will be beyond our wildest dreams; in fact, Paul writes that no matter the trials and sufferings that life on earth brings, they are not comparable with the eternal glory of heaven! What does Revelation say about the saved? “He that overcometh shall inherit all things; and I will be his God, and he shall be my son. But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death.” —Revelation 21:7-8 “And they overcame him by the blood of the Lamb, and by the word of their testimony; and they loved not their lives unto the death.” —Revelation 12:11 “These are they which were not defiled with women; for they are virgins. These are they which follow the Lamb whithersoever he goeth. These were redeemed from among men, being the firstfruits unto God and to the Lamb.” —Revelation 14:4 “And the Spirit and the bride say, Come. And let him that heareth say, Come. And let him that is athirst come. And whosoever will, let him take the water of life freely.” —Revelation 22:17 Those who overcome sin will inherit all things. And how do they overcome? By the blood of the Lamb. The Bible is clear that my only hope of overcoming the defiling sin in my heart is through the power of Jesus working in my life. There is no other way. The whole reason why Jesus left the courts of heaven to live a life of victory on earth and die a humiliating death on the cross on my behalf is because He longs to save me from the filthiness of sin (Matthew 1:21). And He gives this offer of salvation freely. Will I choose to renounce sin and follow the Lamb wherever He goes? What am I to do while waiting for God’s literal kingdom? “In those days came John the Baptist, preaching in the wilderness of Judaea, and saying, Repent ye: for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.” —Matthew 3:1-2 “And when he was demanded of the Pharisees, when the kingdom of God should come, he answered them and said, The kingdom of God cometh not with observation: neither shall they say, Lo here! or, lo there! for, behold, the kingdom of God is within you.” —Luke 17:20-21 “But seek ye first the kingdom of God, and his righteousness; and all these things shall be added unto you.” —Matthew 6:33 “Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done in earth, as it is in heaven.” —Matthew 6:10 When John the Baptist said the kingdom of God is “at hand,” he meant that the spiritual kingdom is already available now! I can experience the love, joy, and peace of God’s spiritual kingdom in my life today when I accept Jesus and give Him the throne of my heart! If seeking His kingdom and righteousness becomes my first priority in life, He will provide everything else for me. May the prayer of Jesus in (Matthew 6:10) be the prayer of my heart every day of my life.",

      "body": "How many does Jesus want to save? “The Lord is not slack concerning his promise, as some men count slackness; but is longsuffering to us-ward, not willing that any should perish, but that all should come to repentance.” —2 Peter 3:9 “For this is good and acceptable in the sight of God our Savior, who desires all men to be saved and to come to the knowledge of the truth.” —1 Timothy 2:3-4, NKJV If God could save every single person, without infringing on their freedom to choose, He would, but this He does not do, because He respects every person’s free will. Instead, He knocks patiently at the door of every heart (Revelation 3:20), waiting to be let in. What is He like? “The LORD hath appeared of old unto me, saying, Yea, I have loved thee with an everlasting love: therefore with lovingkindness have I drawn thee.” —Jeremiah 31:3 “But as he which hath called you is holy, so be ye holy in all manner of conversation; because it is written, Be ye holy; for I am holy.” —1 Peter 1:15-16 “Take heed unto yourselves, lest ye forget the covenant of the LORD your God, which he made with you, and make you a graven image, or the likeness of any thing, which the LORD thy God hath forbidden thee. For the LORD thy God is a consuming fire, even a jealous God.” —Deuteronomy 4:23-24 God is love, but He is also holy. He loves the sinner and has made ample provision for salvation from sin, because sin, and anyone who chooses to cling to it, cannot exist in the presence of a holy God—He is a consuming fire to it. What does the Bible say about the wicked? “Say unto them, As I live, saith the Lord GOD, I have no pleasure in the death of the wicked; but that the wicked turn from his way and live: turn ye, turn ye from your evil ways; for why will ye die, O house of Israel?” —Ezekiel 33:11 “For the LORD shall rise up as in mount Perazim, he shall be wroth as in the valley of Gibeon, that he may do his work, his strange work; and bring to pass his act, his strange act.” —Isaiah 28:21 “For, behold, the day cometh, that shall burn as an oven; and all the proud, yea, and all that do wickedly, shall be stubble: and the day that cometh shall burn them up, saith the LORD of hosts, that it shall leave them neither root nor branch. But unto you that fear my name shall the Sun of righteousness arise with healing in his wings; and ye shall go forth, and grow up as calves of the stall. And ye shall tread down the wicked; for they shall be ashes under the soles of your feet in the day that I shall do this, saith the LORD of hosts.” —Malachi 4:1-3 Because the wicked choose to cling to sin, which, at its core, is selfishness and in complete opposition to God’s government of self-sacrificing love, He has no other choice but to leave them to the consequence of their choice—death (Romans 6:23). The Bible calls this a strange act because God has no pleasure in the death of the wicked; these are people for whom He died, but because they refuse to turn from their path of sin and destruction, He must respect their choice and leave them to its consequences so that the curse of sin—the misery, suffering, and ruin—can be finally blotted out. Note also that Malachi says the fire will burn them up and turn them into ashes, meaning they will not burn in hell forever. What does the Psalmist have to say? “For yet a little while, and the wicked shall not be: yea, thou shalt diligently consider his place, and it shall not be.” —Psalm 37:10 “But the wicked shall perish, and the enemies of the LORD shall be as the fat of lambs: they shall consume; into smoke shall they consume away.” —Psalm 37:20 “Yet he passed away, and, lo, he was not: yea, I sought him, but he could not be found.” —Psalm 37:36 These verses are clear that the wicked will cease to exist after the fire finishes its work. They will not be suffering in hell for eternity. What about Matthew 25:46? “And these shall go away into everlasting punishment: but the righteous into life eternal.” —Matthew 25:46 The word “everlasting” here refers to the eternal consequences of the punishment—it is final. How is the fire of Sodom and Gomorrha described? “Even as Sodom and Gomorrha, and the cities about them in like manner, giving themselves over to fornication, and going after strange flesh, are set forth for an example, suffering the vengeance of eternal fire.” —Jude 7 “And turning the cities of Sodom and Gomorrha into ashes condemned them with an overthrow, making them an ensample unto those that after should live ungodly.” —2 Peter 2:6 The fire that destroyed Sodom and Gomorrha was an eternal fire too, but, obviously, the cities are no longer burning. The Bible is referring to the eternal consequences of the fire, which turned the cities into ashes—never to exist again. Doesn’t the Bible talk about unquenchable fire? “I indeed baptize you with water unto repentance: but he that cometh after me is mightier than I, whose shoes I am not worthy to bear: he shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost, and with fire: whose fan is in his hand, and he will throughly purge his floor, and gather his wheat into the garner; but he will burn up the chaff with unquenchable fire.” —Matthew 3:11-12 The fire is unquenchable in the sense that nothing can put it out until it finishes its work. Is there another instance of this in the Bible? “Thus saith the LORD; Take heed to yourselves, and bear no burden on the sabbath day, nor bring it in by the gates of Jerusalem; neither carry forth a burden out of your houses on the sabbath day, neither do ye any work, but hallow ye the sabbath day, as I commanded your fathers. But they obeyed not, neither inclined their ear, but made their neck stiff, that they might not hear, nor receive instruction. ““And it shall come to pass, if ye diligently hearken unto me, saith the LORD, to bring in no burden through the gates of this city on the sabbath day, but hallow the sabbath day, to do no work therein; then shall there enter into the gates of this city kings and princes sitting upon the throne of David, riding in chariots and on horses, they, and their princes, the men of Judah, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem: and this city shall remain for ever. And they shall come from the cities of Judah, and from the places about Jerusalem, and from the land of Benjamin, and from the plain, and from the mountains, and from the south, bringing burnt offerings, and sacrifices, and meat offerings, and incense, and bringing sacrifices of praise, unto the house of the LORD. ““But if ye will not hearken unto me to hallow the sabbath day, and not to bear a burden, even entering in at the gates of Jerusalem on the sabbath day; then will I kindle a fire in the gates thereof, and it shall devour the palaces of Jerusalem, and it shall not be quenched.” —Jeremiah 17:19-27 “Then they burned the house of God, broke down the wall of Jerusalem, burned all its palaces with fire, and destroyed all its precious possessions. And those who escaped from the sword he carried away to Babylon, where they became servants to him and his sons until the rule of the kingdom of Persia, to fulfill the word of the Lord by the mouth of Jeremiah, until the land had enjoyed her Sabbaths. As long as she lay desolate she kept Sabbath, to fulfill seventy years.” —2 Chronicles 36:21-27 2 Chronicles 36 was the fulfillment of the prophecy given by Jeremiah in chapter 17. Obviously, the fire is no longer burning, but when it was burning, it was an unquenchable fire that could not be put out until it consumed everything. What about Revelation 20:10? “And the devil that deceived them was cast into the lake of fire and brimstone, where the beast and the false prophet are, and shall be tormented day and night for ever and ever.” —Revelation 20:10 “Then his master shall bring him unto the judges; he shall also bring him to the door, or unto the door post; and his master shall bore his ear through with an aul; and he shall serve him for ever.” —Exodus 21:6 “But Hannah went not up; for she said unto her husband, I will not go up until the child be weaned, and then I will bring him, that he may appear before the LORD, and there abide for ever. … Therefore also I have lent him to the LORD; as long as he liveth he shall be lent to the LORD. And he worshipped the LORD there.” —1 Samuel 1:22, 28 The Greek word for “for ever” in Revelation 20:10 is “aion.” It’s where the word “eon” comes from. In the Bible it’s often used to indicate an unspecified period of time. In Exodus 21:6 it represents the life of a slave, and in 1 Samuel 1:22, 28 it means as long as Samuel lives; likewise, in Revelation 20:10 it means the torment lasts until death brings it to an end. Where and when will the fire come down? “As therefore the tares are gathered and burned in the fire; so shall it be in the end of this world. The Son of man shall send forth his angels, and they shall gather out of his kingdom all things that offend, and them which do iniquity; and shall cast them into a furnace of fire: there shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth.” —Matthew 13:40-42 “But the day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night; in the which the heavens shall pass away with a great noise, and the elements shall melt with fervent heat, the earth also and the works that are therein shall be burned up.” —2 Peter 3:10 “And they went up on the breadth of the earth, and compassed the camp of the saints about, and the beloved city: and fire came down from God out of heaven, and devoured them.” —Revelation 20:9 The Bible says the fire comes down on earth at the end of the 1,000 year period when the wicked are raised from the dead and Satan deceives them, for the last time, to make an attempt to capture the New Jerusalem. This is referred to as “the end of the world” in other Bible passages because it is God’s final act of cleansing the world of sin. This also means there is no one burning in hell now. The Bible makes it clear that the dead are in their graves waiting for the resurrection: the saved are waiting for the first resurrection at the second coming of Christ, while the lost are waiting for the second resurrection at the end of the 1,000 years. Who else will be destroyed? “For if God spared not the angels that sinned, but cast them down to hell, and delivered them into chains of darkness, to be reserved unto judgment.” —2 Peter 2:4 “Thine heart was lifted up because of thy beauty, thou hast corrupted thy wisdom by reason of thy brightness: I will cast thee to the ground, I will lay thee before kings, that they may behold thee. Thou hast defiled thy sanctuaries by the multitude of thine iniquities, by the iniquity of thy traffick; therefore will I bring forth a fire from the midst of thee, it shall devour thee, and I will bring thee to ashes upon the earth in the sight of all them that behold thee.” —Ezekiel 28:17-18 The fire cleanses the earth from all traces of sin, and so the fallen angels, including Satan, will also be destroyed by it, turning them to ashes, since the entire rebellion against God started with Satan and the angels he managed to deceive. Is everyone punished equally? “And that servant, which knew his lord’s will, and prepared not himself, neither did according to his will, shall be beaten with many stripes. But he that knew not, and did commit things worthy of stripes, shall be beaten with few stripes. For unto whomsoever much is given, of him shall be much required: and to whom men have committed much, of him they will ask the more.” —Luke 12:47-48 “And, behold, I come quickly; and my reward is with me, to give every man according as his work shall be.” —Revelation 22:12 “For the Son of man shall come in the glory of his Father with his angels; and then he shall reward every man according to his works.” —Matthew 16:27 The punishment is according to a person’s deeds. Those who are guilty of henious crimes against humanity will suffer longer than those who are not. It would be unjust and unfair any other way. What is the result of the fire? “For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.” —Romans 6:23 “Behold, they shall be as stubble; the fire shall burn them; they shall not deliver themselves from the power of the flame: there shall not be a coal to warm at, nor fire to sit before it.” —Isaiah 47:14 “For the day of the LORD is near upon all the heathen: as thou hast done, it shall be done unto thee: thy reward shall return upon thine own head. For as ye have drunk upon my holy mountain, so shall all the heathen drink continually, yea, they shall drink, and they shall swallow down, and they shall be as though they had not been.” —Obadiah 1:15-16 Hell cannot burn forever because the wages of sin are death, not eternal torment for a short life of sin. How cruel would that be! This eternal hell teaching goes all the way back to the Garden of Eden where Satan told Eve she would surely not die (Genesis 3:4) even though God clearly said that sin brings death (Genesis 2:17). But make no mistake, Jesus would rather die on the cross Himself than watch His creation destroyed by fire; nevertheless, He also respects every person’s freedom of choice, and in an effort to purge the world from the misery of sin, it is, ultimately, an act of love to bring the rebellion to an end. And so the fire will burn out once it finishes its work, and there will be not a coal left to warm at. Satan, his angels, and the wicked will cease to exist, never to live again. In Christianity, this is known as annihilationism. What happens once it goes out? “Looking for and hasting unto the coming of the day of God, wherein the heavens being on fire shall be dissolved, and the elements shall melt with fervent heat? Nevertheless we, according to his promise, look for new heavens and a new earth, wherein dwelleth righteousness.” —2 Peter 3:12-13 “And I saw a new heaven and a new earth: for the first heaven and the first earth were passed away; and there was no more sea. And I John saw the holy city, new Jerusalem, coming down from God out of heaven, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband. And I heard a great voice out of heaven saying, Behold, the tabernacle of God is with men, and he will dwell with them, and they shall be his people, and God himself shall be with them, and be their God. And God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes; and there shall be no more death, neither sorrow, nor crying, neither shall there be any more pain: for the former things are passed away.” —Revelation 21:1-4 “What do ye imagine against the LORD? he will make an utter end: affliction shall not rise up the second time.” —Nahum 1:9 Once every trace of sin is wiped out, God will create a new heaven and a new earth in which righteousness dwells. The universe will be forever secure from the curse of sin ever rising again because everyone will know, from experience, that God is love. The rebellion brought out the love of Jesus and the Father like nothing else could, and it was their love that conquered it.",

      "series": "The Bible Sabbath",
      "body": "What does Isaiah say about keeping the Sabbath? “Blessed is the man that doeth this, and the son of man that layeth hold on it; that keepeth the sabbath from polluting it, and keepeth his hand from doing any evil.” —Isaiah 56:2 Our heavenly Father pronounces a blessing on everyone who chooses to keep His Sabbath holy. Is this confirmed elsewhere? “For in six days the LORD made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that in them is, and rested the seventh day: wherefore the LORD blessed the sabbath day, and hallowed it.” —Exodus 20:11 “And it shall come to pass, if thou shalt hearken diligently unto the voice of the LORD thy God, to observe and to do all his commandments which I command thee this day, that the LORD thy God will set thee on high above all nations of the earth: and all these blessings shall come on thee, and overtake thee, if thou shalt hearken unto the voice of the LORD thy God. … But it shall come to pass, if thou wilt not hearken unto the voice of the LORD thy God, to observe to do all his commandments and his statutes which I command thee this day; that all these curses shall come upon thee, and overtake thee.” —Deuteronomy 28:1-2, 15 The Sabbath was not made to be a burden, but a blessing to the human race. Those who keep it partake of that blessing on a weekly basis. In Deuteronomy 28, God pronounces additional blessings on those who keep His commandments, including the fourth. How is the Sabbath to be kept? “Remember the sabbath day, to keep it holy. Six days shalt thou labour, and do all thy work: but the seventh day is the sabbath of the LORD thy God: in it thou shalt not do any work, thou, nor thy son, nor thy daughter, thy manservant, nor thy maidservant, nor thy cattle, nor thy stranger that is within thy gates: for in six days the LORD made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that in them is, and rested the seventh day: wherefore the LORD blessed the sabbath day, and hallowed it.” —Exodus 20:8-11 The Sabbath was instituted to provide rest and refuge in and through Christ (Matthew 11:28-30). It is a special weekly blessing for everyone who chooses to rest from their works by trusting in Him. We may have a long list of things to do, but we can still set them aside in order to have time to connect with God and acknowledge His supremacy in our lives. This rest from work extends to everyone “within our gates,” meaning those under our authority. How did Jesus keep it? “And he came to Nazareth, where he had been brought up: and, as his custom was, he went into the synagogue on the sabbath day, and stood up for to read.” —Luke 4:16 “And they went into Capernaum; and straightway on the sabbath day he entered into the synagogue, and taught.” —Mark 1:21 “And when the sabbath day was come, he began to teach in the synagogue: and many hearing him were astonished, saying, From whence hath this man these things? and what wisdom is this which is given unto him, that even such mighty works are wrought by his hands?” —Mark 6:2 “And it came to pass also on another sabbath, that he entered into the synagogue and taught: and there was a man whose right hand was withered.” —Luke 6:6 Looking to Jesus as our example in all things, we learn that Sabbath keeping also involves gathering with other believers for worship, spiritual nourishment, and fellowship. The verses above also show that teaching was a vital part of the synagogue experience, meaning it was far more than a casual weekly social gathering. It was a place for studying Scripture, where worshippers could learn, share, and become grounded in the truth (2 Timothy 2:15). Was this the case in the Old Testament too? “Six days shall work be done: but the seventh day is the sabbath of rest, an holy convocation; ye shall do no work therein: it is the sabbath of the LORD in all your dwellings.” —Leviticus 23:3 Not only is the Sabbath a time to convene with other believers, but this convening is called holy. Corporate praise and worship of God, praying with and for one another (Acts 16:13), Bible study, and fellowship (especially when we use it to share our experiences with God) are all integral parts of making the Sabbath a delight. When does the Sabbath start and end? “It is to be a Sabbath of complete rest for you, and you shall humble yourselves; on the ninth of the month at evening, from evening until evening, you shall keep your Sabbath.” —Leviticus 23:32, NASB “And God called the light Day, and the darkness he called Night. And the evening and the morning were the first day.” —Genesis 1:5 In the Bible, a day does not begin and end at midnight; it starts at sunset and continues until the following sunset. In the Genesis account, each day includes the prior evening as well, so since the Sabbath is the seventh day of the week, it begins at sunset on Friday and ends at sunset on Saturday. What insight does Isaiah give? “If thou turn away thy foot from the sabbath, from doing thy pleasure on my holy day; and call the sabbath a delight, the holy of the LORD, honourable; and shalt honour him, not doing thine own ways, nor finding thine own pleasure, nor speaking thine own words: then shalt thou delight thyself in the LORD; and I will cause thee to ride upon the high places of the earth, and feed thee with the heritage of Jacob thy father: for the mouth of the LORD hath spoken it.” —Isaiah 58:13-14 The Sabbath becomes a delight when Jesus is at its center—when we put away our own pursuits and rest from the cares of life to focus on the eternal things of God. It’s a special day to reflect on, honor, and connect with Him. Simply put, it is a day to delight in Him. The motivation behind Sabbath-keeping is crucial because it determines whether the day becomes a delight or a burden. Only when we keep it out of love for Christ—rather than duty—are we enabled to deny self and still call the Sabbath a delight. The truly born-again follower of Christ transitions from an attitude of “Don’t tell me what to do” to “What would You have me do?” What can we learn from the experience of Nehemiah? “In those days saw I in Judah some treading wine presses on the sabbath, and bringing in sheaves, and lading asses; as also wine, grapes, and figs, and all manner of burdens, which they brought into Jerusalem on the sabbath day: and I testified against them in the day wherein they sold victuals. There dwelt men of Tyre also therein, which brought fish, and all manner of ware, and sold on the sabbath unto the children of Judah, and in Jerusalem. Then I contended with the nobles of Judah, and said unto them, What evil thing is this that ye do, and profane the sabbath day? Did not your fathers thus, and did not our God bring all this evil upon us, and upon this city? yet ye bring more wrath upon Israel by profaning the sabbath. ““And it came to pass, that when the gates of Jerusalem began to be dark before the sabbath, I commanded that the gates should be shut, and charged that they should not be opened till after the sabbath: and some of my servants set I at the gates, that there should no burden be brought in on the sabbath day. So the merchants and sellers of all kind of ware lodged without Jerusalem once or twice. Then I testified against them, and said unto them, Why lodge ye about the wall? if ye do so again, I will lay hands on you. From that time forth came they no more on the sabbath. And I commanded the Levites that they should cleanse themselves, and that they should come and keep the gates, to sanctify the sabbath day.” —Nehemiah 13:15-22 We can clearly see that buying, selling, and conducting business to generate income are activities that profane the Sabbath day. This can pose a challenge for some professions; for example, it would not be right to abandon those in need of medical care on the Sabbath for example. However, as far as possible, we should seek to rest from secular activities in order to honor our Creator. What activities are encouraged on the Sabbath? “And he said unto them, What man shall there be among you, that shall have one sheep, and if it fall into a pit on the sabbath day, will he not lay hold on it, and lift it out? How much then is a man better than a sheep? Wherefore it is lawful to do well on the sabbath days. Then saith he to the man, Stretch forth thine hand. And he stretched it forth; and it was restored whole, like as the other.” —Matthew 12:11-13 Jesus continued to heal on the Sabbath, contrary to the traditions of the religious leaders of His time. Ministry to the sick, the needy, and the discouraged—by relieving their physical, emotional, or spiritual suffering—extends the blessing and delight of the Sabbath beyond ourselves to others. Any other activities? “Remember the sabbath day, to keep it holy. Six days shalt thou labour, and do all thy work: But the seventh day is the sabbath of the LORD thy God: in it thou shalt not do any work, thou, nor thy son, nor thy daughter, thy manservant, nor thy maidservant, nor thy cattle, nor thy stranger that is within thy gates: For in six days the LORD made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that in them is, and rested the seventh day: wherefore the LORD blessed the sabbath day, and hallowed it.” —Exodus 20:8-11 “And on the sabbath we went out of the city by a river side, where prayer was wont to be made; and we sat down, and spake unto the women which resorted thither.” —Acts 16:13 Since the Sabbath is a memorial of God as Creator and Redeemer, spending time in nature contemplating His wondrous works—and the power of His word that created them—can be an incredibly inspiring Sabbath activity. The Word that took a dark, formless earth (Genesis 1:2) and brought it to life still has the same power today to recreate our broken characters in His image (John 6:63; 1 Peter 1:25). His redemptive power is available to all who turn to His Word, the Bible, and claim His promises by faith (Ezekiel 36:25-27; Jeremiah 31:33; 2 Corinthians 5:17; Galatians 3:22). One more thing worth mentioning: Acts 16:13 shows us that prayer can be the perfect complement to time spent in nature. As we contemplate God’s creation, we may find ourselves naturally drawn into prayer—thanking and praising Him for what He has done, or simply sharing what is on our hearts. For whom was the Sabbath instituted? “And it came to pass, that he went through the corn fields on the sabbath day; and his disciples began, as they went, to pluck the ears of corn. And the Pharisees said unto him, Behold, why do they on the sabbath day that which is not lawful? And he said unto them, Have ye never read what David did, when he had need, and was an hungred, he, and they that were with him? How he went into the house of God in the days of Abiathar the high priest, and did eat the shewbread, which is not lawful to eat but for the priests, and gave also to them which were with him? And he said unto them, The sabbath was made for man, and not man for the sabbath: therefore the Son of man is Lord also of the sabbath.” —Mark 2:23-28 The Pharisees added so many man-made rules in an effort to protect the Sabbath’s holiness that they turned it into a burden. But Jesus did not follow their rules—He followed His Father’s will regarding proper Sabbath-keeping. In fact, Jesus clarified that the Sabbath was made for us, not the other way around (For a more in-depth look at how to keep the Sabbath holy, see Doug Batchelor’s book How to Keep the Sabbath Holy.) How can an unholy person keep the Sabbath holy? “For I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ: for it is the power of God unto salvation to every one that believeth; to the Jew first, and also to the Greek. For therein is the righteousness of God revealed from faith to faith: as it is written, The just shall live by faith.” —Romans 1:16-17 “… for whatsoever is not of faith is sin.” —Romans 14:23 “I am crucified with Christ: nevertheless I live; yet not I, but Christ liveth in me: and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God, who loved me, and gave himself for me.” —Galatians 2:20 The only way the Sabbath can be kept holy is in Christ and by faith. Without Christ living in us by faith, through His Spirit (John 14:17; Ephesians 2:22), we are completely incapable of keeping it holy. According to Paul, it is not even our own faith that enables this, but Christ’s faith working in us! No wonder Revelation speaks of a group of God’s faithful people who “keep the commandments of God and the faith of Jesus” (Revelation 14:12). Trying to keep His commandments in any way other than by faith is like asking a plant to grow without sunlight—an impossibility. In Jeremiah 31:33, God promised to write His law in our hearts. Do we believe Him? If He said it, He will fulfill it; we just have to ask! Have we asked Him, claimed His promise by faith, and thanked Him for doing it—even before we see any results? This is faith: taking God at His Word because He cannot lie (Numbers 23:19). Of course, we always have the freedom to interfere with or disrupt this process by filling our minds with things that glamorize sin. But if we choose to cooperate with Him, He will complete the work He began in us (Hebrews 12:2; Jude 1:24-25), and we will be able to genuinely say, “I delight to do thy will, O my God: yea, thy law is within my heart” (Psalm 40:8). Will God provide for my needs? “And the LORD said unto Moses, How long refuse ye to keep my commandments and my laws? See, for that the LORD hath given you the sabbath, therefore he giveth you on the sixth day the bread of two days; abide ye every man in his place, let no man go out of his place on the seventh day. So the people rested on the seventh day.” —Exodus 16:28-30 “Wherefore the LORD God of Israel saith, I said indeed that thy house, and the house of thy father, should walk before me for ever: but now the LORD saith, Be it far from me; for them that honour me I will honour, and they that despise me shall be lightly esteemed.” —1 Samuel 2:30 It may be tempting to worry about lost income on the Sabbath, but just as God miraculously provided a double portion of manna for the Israelites on Friday so they would have enough for Saturday, He will also provide for our needs today when we choose to honor Him by resting on His holy day. What promise does Jesus give me? “Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest. Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me; for I am meek and lowly in heart: and ye shall find rest unto your souls. For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light.” —Matthew 11:28-30 “For this is the love of God, that we keep his commandments: and his commandments are not grievous.” —1 John 5:3 The Pharisees turned the Sabbath into a burdensome yoke, but Jesus came to restore it as the delight it was always meant to be. If keeping the Sabbath feels like a burden, ask Him to help you experience its true joy—and He certainly will.",

What would be the manner of His conception? “Therefore the Lord himself shall give you a sign; Behold, a virgin shall conceive, and bear a son, and shall call his name Immanuel.” —Isaiah 7:14 “And the angel said unto her, Fear not, Mary: for thou hast found favour with God. And, behold, thou shalt conceive in thy womb, and bring forth a son, and shalt call his name JESUS. He shall be great, and shall be called the Son of the Highest: and the Lord God shall give unto him the throne of his father David: And he shall reign over the house of Jacob for ever; and of his kingdom there shall be no end. Then said Mary unto the angel, How shall this be, seeing I know not a man?” —Luke 1:30-34 “But while he thought on these things, behold, the angel of the Lord appeared unto him in a dream, saying, Joseph, thou son of David, fear not to take unto thee Mary thy wife: for that which is conceived in her is of the Holy Ghost.” —Matthew 1:20 What lineage would He come from? “I shall see him, but not now: I shall behold him, but not nigh: there shall come a Star out of Jacob, and a Sceptre shall rise out of Israel.” —Numbers 24:17 “Judah, thou art he whom thy brethren shall praise: thy hand shall be in the neck of thine enemies; thy father’s children shall bow down before thee. Judah is a lion’s whelp: from the prey, my son, thou art gone up: he stooped down, he couched as a lion, and as an old lion; who shall rouse him up? The sceptre shall not depart from Judah, nor a lawgiver from between his feet, until Shiloh come; and unto him shall the gathering of the people be.” —Genesis 49:8-10 “Behold, the days come, saith the Lord, that I will raise unto David a righteous Branch, and a King shall reign and prosper, and shall execute judgment and justice in the earth.” —Jeremiah 23:5 These prophecies came from different time periods and different prophets, but they all accurately foretold that Jesus would come from the lineage of Jacob, Judah, and king David. What was said about His ministry? “The Spirit of the Lord GOD is upon me; because the LORD hath anointed me to preach good tidings unto the meek; he hath sent me to bind up the brokenhearted, to proclaim liberty to the captives, and the opening of the prison to them that are bound; To proclaim the acceptable year of the LORD, and the day of vengeance of our God; to comfort all that mourn; To appoint unto them that mourn in Zion, to give unto them beauty for ashes, the oil of joy for mourning, the garment of praise for the spirit of heaviness; that they might be called trees of righteousness, the planting of the LORD, that he might be glorified.” —Isaiah 61:1-3 Who would betray Him? “For it was not an enemy that reproached me; then I could have borne it: neither was it he that hated me that did magnify himself against me; then I would have hid myself from him: But it was thou, a man mine equal, my guide, and mine acquaintance.” —Psalm 55:12-13 “Yea, mine own familiar friend, in whom I trusted, which did eat of my bread, hath lifted up his heel against me.” —Psalm 41:9 “When Jesus had said these things, He was troubled in spirit, and testified and said, “Most assuredly, I say to you, one of you will betray Me.” Then the disciples looked at one another, perplexed about whom He spoke. &hellip; Jesus answered, “It is he to whom I shall give a piece of bread when I have dipped it.” And having dipped the bread, He gave it to Judas Iscariot, the son of Simon.” —John 13:21-22, 26, NKJV Jesus was betrayed by a friend, one of His own disciples, and even the act that initiated the betrayal was accurately foretold—the eating of bread. How much would He be sold for? “And I said unto them, If ye think good, give me my price; and if not, forbear. So they weighed for my price thirty pieces of silver. And the LORD said unto me, Cast it unto the potter: a goodly price that I was prised at of them. And I took the thirty pieces of silver, and cast them to the potter in the house of the LORD.” —Zechariah 11:12-13 “Then Judas, which had betrayed him, when he saw that he was condemned, repented himself, and brought again the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and elders, Saying, I have sinned in that I have betrayed the innocent blood. And they said, What is that to us? see thou to that. And he cast down the pieces of silver in the temple, and departed, and went and hanged himself. And the chief priests took the silver pieces, and said, It is not lawful for to put them into the treasury, because it is the price of blood. And they took counsel, and bought with them the potter’s field, to bury strangers in.” —Matthew 27:3-7 “If the ox shall push a manservant or a maidservant; he shall give unto their master thirty shekels of silver, and the ox shall be stoned.” —Exodus 21:32 Jesus was sold for thirty pieces of silver, the price of a slave, but not only was the amount accurately foretold, but also Judas’ act of throwing the money into the temple, as well as that money subsequently going to a potter! How would He suffer? “Surely He hath borne our griefs, and carried our sorrows: yet we did esteem Him stricken, smitten of God, and afflicted. But He was wounded for our transgressions, He was bruised for our iniquities: the chastisement of our peace was upon Him; and with His stripes we are healed. All we like sheep have gone astray; we have turned every one to his own way; and the Lord hath laid on Him the iniquity of us all. He was oppressed, and He was afflicted, yet He opened not His mouth: He is brought as a lamb to the slaughter, and as a sheep before her shearers is dumb, so He openeth not His mouth.” —Isaiah 53:4-7 What would happen to his hands and feet? “For dogs have compassed me: the assembly of the wicked have inclosed me: they pierced my hands and my feet.” —Psalm 22:16 “And when they were come to the place, which is called Calvary, there they crucified him, and the malefactors, one on the right hand, and the other on the left. Then said Jesus, Father, forgive them; for they know not what they do.” —Luke 23:33-34 What about His clothing? “They divide My garments among them, and for My clothing they cast lots.” —Psalm 22:18, NKJV “And when they had crucified him, they parted his garments, casting lots upon them, what every man should take.” —Mark 15:24 What about His cry on the cross? “My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me? why art thou so far from helping me, and from the words of my roaring?” —Psalm 22:1 “And about the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, saying, Eli, Eli, lama sabachthani? that is to say, My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?” —Matthew 27:46 Was anything said about the timing of His death? “Observe the month of Abib, and keep the passover unto the LORD thy God: for in the month of Abib the LORD thy God brought thee forth out of Egypt by night.” —Deuteronomy 16:1 “Your lamb shall be without blemish, a male of the first year: ye shall take it out from the sheep, or from the goats: And ye shall keep it up until the fourteenth day of the same month: and the whole assembly of the congregation of Israel shall kill it in the evening.” —Exodus 12:5-6 “Purge out therefore the old leaven, that ye may be a new lump, as ye are unleavened. For even Christ our passover is sacrificed for us.” —1 Corinthians 5:7 In an incredible fulfillment of prophecy, Jesus, the Passover lamb to whom all the prior Passover feasts were pointing, died on the fourteenth day of the Hebrew month of Abib at about the ninth hour (Matthew 27:46-50). Would any of His bones be broken? “He keepeth all his bones: not one of them is broken.” —Psalm 34:20 “Then came the soldiers, and brake the legs of the first, and of the other which was crucified with him. But when they came to Jesus, and saw that he was dead already, they brake not his legs.” —John 19:32-33 What was said about His grave? “And His grave was assigned with wicked men, yet He was with a rich man in His death, because He had done no violence, nor was there any deceit in His mouth.” —Isaiah 53:9, NASB “When the even was come, there came a rich man of Arimathaea, named Joseph, who also himself was Jesus’ disciple: He went to Pilate, and begged the body of Jesus. Then Pilate commanded the body to be delivered. And when Joseph had taken the body, he wrapped it in a clean linen cloth, And laid it in his own new tomb, which he had hewn out in the rock: and he rolled a great stone to the door of the sepulchre, and departed.” —Matthew 27:57-60 Would He remain in the grave forever? “For you will not leave my soul among the dead or allow your Holy One to rot in the grave.” —Psalm 16:10, NLT “I am he that liveth, and was dead; and, behold, I am alive for evermore, amen; and have the keys of hell and of death.” —Revelation 1:18 Because death could not conquer the Author and Giver of life, we also have the hope of resurrection!",

      "body": "Should I be praying more? “And he withdrew himself into the wilderness, and prayed.” —Luke 5:16 “And in the morning, rising up a great while before day, he went out, and departed into a solitary place, and there prayed.” —Mark 5:17 “And when he had sent them away, he departed into a mountain to pray.” —Mark 6:46 “And they came to a place which was named Gethsemane: and he saith to his disciples, Sit ye here, while I shall pray.” —Mark 14:32 The Bible tells us that Jesus, our example, was a man of prayer. If He had a need to pray, how much more do we? Does God hear my prayers? “If ye then, being evil, know how to give good gifts unto your children: how much more shall your heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to them that ask him?” —Luke 11:13 “If ye then, being evil, know how to give good gifts unto your children, how much more shall your Father which is in heaven give good things to them that ask him?” —Matthew 7:11 “O thou that hearest prayer, unto thee shall all flesh come.” —Psalm 65:2 Jesus made it clear that our heavenly Father wants us to come to Him in prayer. He is more willing to grant our requests than parents are to give good gifts to their children. Of course, He doesn’t grant every request, but only those that will result in “good things” (Matthew 7:11)—that is, those in harmony with His wise and loving will for us. What heart posture is needed? “And he arose, and came to his father. But when he was yet a great way off, his father saw him, and had compassion, and ran, and fell on his neck, and kissed him. And the son said unto him, Father, I have sinned against heaven, and in thy sight, and am no more worthy to be called thy son.” —Luke 15:20-21 “Two men went up into the temple to pray; the one a Pharisee, and the other a publican. The Pharisee stood and prayed thus with himself, God, I thank thee, that I am not as other men are, extortioners, unjust, adulterers, or even as this publican. I fast twice in the week, I give tithes of all that I possess. And the publican, standing afar off, would not lift up so much as his eyes unto heaven, but smote upon his breast, saying, God be merciful to me a sinner. I tell you, this man went down to his house justified rather than the other: for every one that exalteth himself shall be abased; and he that humbleth himself shall be exalted.” —Luke 18:10-14 “And Jesus answering said unto them, They that are whole need not a physician; but they that are sick. I came not to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance.” —Luke 5:31-32 Being aware of our true relationship to God leads to prayers rooted in humility and reverence for Him—a consciousness of His holiness and wisdom, as well as our own unworthiness. It is only through the blood of Christ, shed for our sins, that we have been reconciled to our heavenly Father and enabled to come to Him in prayer. The Pharisee felt self-sufficient and therefore saw no need of Jesus, but the publican and the prodigal son were keenly aware of their unworthiness. Jesus made it clear that those who believe they are righteous feel little need of His righteousness, but those who recognize they are sinners are the ones He came to make whole (Luke 8:48). How did Daniel and Paul view themselves? “We have sinned, and have committed iniquity, and have done wickedly, and have rebelled, even by departing from thy precepts and from thy judgments.” —Daniel 9:5 “O Lord, righteousness belongeth unto thee, but unto us confusion of faces, as at this day; to the men of Judah, and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and unto all Israel, that are near, and that are far off, through all the countries whither thou hast driven them, because of their trespass that they have trespassed against thee.” —Daniel 9:7 “O my God, incline thine ear, and hear; open thine eyes, and behold our desolations, and the city which is called by thy name: for we do not present our supplications before thee for our righteousnesses, but for thy great mercies.” —Daniel 9:18 “This is a faithful saying, and worthy of all acceptation, that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners; of whom I am chief.” —1 Timothy 1:15 Daniel, after a lifetime of following God, included himself in the sins of his people when praying for God’s forgiveness. He did not say, “They have sinned,” but, “We have sinned.” Likewise, Paul, after many fruitful years of preaching, teaching, and building up the early church, did not hesitate to call himself the chief of sinners. He could have said, “Of whom I was chief,” but he said, “Of whom I am chief.” Today, there is so much emphasis on our identity as sons and daughters of God that calling oneself a sinner is almost viewed as heresy or a perversion of the gospel, but Paul and Daniel would beg to differ. It is true that in Christ we are children of God, but let us not forget who we are apart from Christ, so we never lose sight of our need to continually cling to Him (1 Corinthians 10:12); otherwise, we risk adopting the Pharisaic mindset—that being God’s children we no longer have a need of repentance (1 John 5:8). Anything else on heart posture? “And this is the confidence that we have in him, that, if we ask any thing according to his will, he heareth us: And if we know that he hear us, whatsoever we ask, we know that we have the petitions that we desired of him.” —1 John 5:14-15 “And he went a little further, and fell on his face, and prayed, saying, O my Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me: nevertheless not as I will, but as thou wilt.” —Matthew 26:39 “And whatsoever we ask, we receive of him, because we keep his commandments, and do those things that are pleasing in his sight.” —1 John 3:22 “If I regard iniquity in my heart, the Lord will not hear me.” —Psalm 66:18 It’s crucial to be fully surrendered to His will for our prayers to be effective. If there is anything in our lives that is out of harmony with His will—any sin He has convicted us about—it’s crucial that we humble ourselves, repent, and forsake it. If the desire to do this is lacking, we can ask Him to give it to us (Acts 5:31; Philippians 2:13). The unconverted human heart is naturally drawn to sin, so it is God alone who can give us a hatred for it (Genesis 3:15). Willful rebellion is so serious that, according to Proverbs 28:9, it makes one’s prayer an abomination to God. Paul echoes this sentiment when he says that God will not be mocked (Galatians 6:7), for He sees our hearts and knows when we are harboring willful hypocrisy or pretense toward Him. God will never force His will upon us, which is why surrender begins with the willingness to follow His will. It’s a choice we consciously make, giving Him permission to activate His will and power in our lives. What should be the focus of prayer? “But seek ye first the kingdom of God, and his righteousness; and all these things shall be added unto you.” —Matthew 6:33 “After this manner therefore pray ye: Our Father which art in heaven, Hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done in earth, as it is in heaven.” —Matthew 6:9-10 It is easy for our prayers to become self-focused and selfish, but Christ teaches us to seek first His kingdom and His righteousness. This is later reinforced in His model prayer: “Hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done.” Below are some difficult—but necessary—questions we can ask to help us understand where we stand: 1. Is my primary focus on bringing glory and honor to His holy name rather than my own? 1. Am I preparing for and investing in His kingdom of righteousness—which, by the way, starts in our hearts now (Luke 17:20-21)—or am I more concerned with expanding my own personal, earthly empire? 1. Am I seeking His will in my daily life, or am I pursuing my own wants and desires above all else? One author shared the following insight on praying Jesus’ model prayer: “I cannot say ‘our’ if I live only for myself. I cannot say ‘Father’ if I do not endeavor each day to act like his child. I cannot say ‘who art in heaven’ if I’m laying up no treasures there. I cannot say ‘hallowed be thy name’ if I am not striving for holiness. I cannot say ‘thy kingdom come’ if I’m not seeking to hasten the blessed hope. I cannot say ‘thy will be done’ if I am disobedient to his word. I cannot say ‘in earth as it is in heaven’ if I’ll not serve him here and now. I cannot say ‘give us this day our daily bread’ if I am selfishly hoarding for the future. I cannot say ‘forgive us our debts’ if I harbor a grudge against anyone. I cannot say ‘lead us not into temptation’ if I deliberately place myself in its path. I cannot say ‘deliver us from evil’ if I do not long for holiness. I cannot say ‘thine is the kingdom’ if I do not give Jesus the throne of my heart. I cannot attribute to him ‘the power’ if I fear what men may do. I cannot ascribe to him ‘the glory’ if I’m seeking for my own honor. I cannot say ‘forever’ if I’m living only for temporary earthly rewards.” —Anonymous Quoted in Doug Batchelor, Teach Us to Pray, 30 (2005). What things can I pray about? “Casting all your care upon him; for he careth for you.” —1 Peter 5:7 “Cast thy burden upon the LORD, and he shall sustain thee: He shall never suffer the righteous to be moved.” —Psalm 55:22 “Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest.” —Matthew 11:28 Besides praying for His glory, His kingdom, and His will, God also cares about our personal lives and invites us to bring to Him anything that causes worry, trouble, or heaviness in our hearts. He is our loving heavenly Father who is deeply interested in the burdens we carry, and He wants to help! What about intercessory prayer? “Praying always with all prayer and supplication in the Spirit, and watching thereunto with all perseverance and supplication for all saints.” —Ephesians 6:18 “I exhort therefore, that, first of all, supplications, prayers, intercessions, and giving of thanks, be made for all men; for kings, and for all that are in authority; that we may lead a quiet and peaceable life in all godliness and honesty. For this is good and acceptable in the sight of God our Saviour.” —1 Timothy 2:1-3 “And the Lord said, Simon, Simon, behold, Satan hath desired to have you, that he may sift you as wheat: but I have prayed for thee, that thy faith fail not: and when thou art converted, strengthen thy brethren.” —Luke 22:31,32 Praying for others is another crucial part of our prayer life. When we pray for someone else, God receives the legal right to work in that person’s life—a right He might not otherwise have if we had not prayed. Why is this? Since God values each person’s freedom of choice, He does not work against someone’s will, especially if that person is resistant to Him, but when another person begins interceding, it changes everything. It opens the door for God to work in the resistant person’s life out of respect for the intercessor’s prayer. Intercessory prayer, however, is not limited to those who are resistant to God. Jesus prayed for Peter—one of His own disciples—because He saw a blind spot in Peter’s life that Peter was unaware of. Moses prayed for the Israelites (Numbers 21:7) and for his brother Aaron (Deuteronomy 9:20), and Job prayed for his friends (Job 42:10). Just as Jesus intercedes for us in the heavenly sanctuary (Hebrews 7:25), we, as His followers, are called to intercede for others. What does intercession require? “Praying always with all prayer and supplication in the Spirit, and watching thereunto with all perseverance and supplication for all saints.” —Ephesians 6:18 “And he spake a parable unto them to this end, that men ought always to pray, and not to faint.” —Luke 18:1 “Pray without ceasing.” —1 Thessalonians 5:17 “Now she that is a widow indeed, and desolate, trusteth in God, and continueth in supplications and prayers night and day. But she that liveth in pleasure is dead while she liveth.” —1 Timothy 5:5-6 Praying for others often involves asking God for a change of heart, and this usually takes time. God honors everyone’s free will, but He also honors the prayers of others, so even if a person resists Him initially, there is still hope, as long as those praying are willing to persevere and be patient. It may take years—or even decades—for a change of heart to take place, but that is nothing compared with eternity. All good things take time and effort, and prayer is no different. Rushed prayers often lack power because they don’t mean much to us, but prayers that produce results take time and effort. It would be wise for us to preface every important decision or action in our lives with much prayer. Jesus Himself sometimes prayed all night, such as before ordaining the twelve apostles (Luke 6:12-13). As our prayer life develops, spending time communing with our Father becomes a delight, no matter how long it takes. What is the first step to effective prayer? “Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and ye shall find; knock, and it shall be opened unto you. For every one that asketh receiveth; and he that seeketh findeth; and to him that knocketh it shall be opened.” —Matthew 7:7-8 This might seem obvious, but simply bringing our request to God—asking Him to be involved in resolving it—is the first step toward effective prayer. God is a Gentleman (Revelation 3:20); He will not involve Himself where He is not desired or welcomed. He respects our free will too much to force His way into our lives without our permission. By the way, the best things to ask for are those that are in harmony with His will as revealed in His Word. If we can find a verse in the Bible showing that our request aligns with His will, we can have confidence that we are on the right track. What is the second step? “And Jesus answering saith unto them, Have faith in God. For verily I say unto you, That whosoever shall say unto this mountain, Be thou removed, and be thou cast into the sea; and shall not doubt in his heart, but shall believe that those things which he saith shall come to pass; he shall have whatsoever he saith. Therefore I say unto you, What things soever ye desire, when ye pray, believe that ye receive them, and ye shall have them.” —Mark 11:22-24 Faith is the hand that reaches out to God, taking Him at His word. One of the many ways God is different from us is that His word has creative power to accomplish what He pleases (Isaiah 55:11). When we speak, our words have no power to create something out of nothing, but when God speaks, things happen (Genesis 1:3); if He has promised something, we can count on Him to keep that promise (Numbers 23:19)—and there is a promise in the Bible for all of our needs. But what if our faith is weak? The Bible tells us that: 1. God has given every person a measure of faith (Romans 12:3). 1. We can ask Him to increase our faith (Mark 9:24), and He will likely give us opportunities to exercise it. 1. Faith comes by hearing, and hearing by the Word of God (Romans 10:17). In other words, we grow in faith as we get to know Him more through the study of His Word and through prayer. So why is faith so important to God? Well, it is the foundation of our relationship with Him. There is nothing more pleasing to a father than a child coming to him in confidence, full of trust in his love and power. Our heavenly Father delights when we come to Him in prayer, trusting that He will hear and answer our requests in His time and way. What is the third step? “Then they took away the stone from the place where the dead was laid. And Jesus lifted up his eyes, and said, Father, I thank thee that thou hast heard me. And I knew that thou hearest me always: but because of the people which stand by I said it, that they may believe that thou hast sent me. And when he thus had spoken, he cried with a loud voice, Lazarus, come forth. And he that was dead came forth …” —John 11:41-44 “And when he had consulted with the people, he appointed singers unto the LORD, and that should praise the beauty of holiness, as they went out before the army, and to say, Praise the LORD; for his mercy endureth for ever. And when they began to sing and to praise, the LORD set ambushments against the children of Ammon, Moab, and mount Seir, which were come against Judah; and they were smitten.” —2 Chronicles 20:21-22 When Jesus raised Lazarus, He thanked God for hearing His prayer before the resurrection occurred. Likewise, when the Israelites went to war under Jehoshaphat, they praised God before the battle even began. Thanking God before we receive His answer is closely related to the concept we just discussed—faith; it is further evidence of a trusting confidence in His love. It is natural to give thanks for something already received, but giving thanks in advance requires faith. However, if we know our request is in harmony with His will, as revealed in the Bible, we can be confident that He will answer it. Knowing God’s will for us requires Bible study, but there is power in finding a promise in His Word that pertains to our request, presenting it to Him in prayer, and then claiming it—in the name of His beloved Son—by faith, and thanking Him for it. In Jesus, all of God’s promises are sure (2 Corinthians 1:20). Obviously, how and when God answers our prayers is up to Him. He may say “Yes,” or He may say “Wait” if the timing is not quite right, thereby giving us a chance to practice patience. “No” is a perfectly legitimate answer too, even though it may not be what we wanted. In such cases, we can rest in the assurance that He sees the end from the beginning and always has our best interests in mind—knowing what is best for us better than we do ourselves. The three parts of an effective prayer can be easily remembered with the ABC acronym: Ask (A), Believe (B), and Claim (C). Author Glen Coon expounds on these in greater detail in his book The ABCs of Bible Prayer. Why do we pray in Jesus’ name? “And whatsoever ye shall ask in my name, that will I do, that the Father may be glorified in the Son. If ye shall ask any thing in my name, I will do it.” —John 14:13,14 “Ye have not chosen me, but I have chosen you, and ordained you, that ye should go and bring forth fruit, and that your fruit should remain: that whatsoever ye shall ask of the Father in my name, he may give it you.” —John 15:16 “And in that day ye shall ask me nothing. Verily, verily, I say unto you, Whatsoever ye shall ask the Father in my name, he will give it you. Hitherto have ye asked nothing in my name: ask, and ye shall receive, that your joy may be full.” —John 16:23,24 In Adam and Eve’s rejection of God in the garden, the human race separated itself from its Maker, but God immediately promised that, in His Son Jesus, He would provide them, and anyone who desired it, a path to reconciliation (Genesis 3:15). This promise was later illustrated to Jacob in the dream of a ladder, symbolizing Jesus, that united heaven and earth (Genesis 28:12). Adam and Eve’s rejection is replayed in the life of every person, for all have sinned (Romans 3:23). Apart from Christ—who alone lived a perfect life and offered it on the cross to pay for our sins—we have nothing to commend us to God. Our sins have made us unworthy of our Father (Luke 15:21), but Jesus has given us a second chance! When we pray in His name, we are enabled to “come boldly unto the throne of grace, that we may obtain mercy, and find grace to help in time of need” (Hebrews 4:16) because, when we accept Him as our Redeemer and Lord, He covers the shame of our sins with His perfect righteousness (Isaiah 61:10), and God calls us His children once more (1 John 3:1)! How important is gratitude? “And let the peace of God rule in your hearts, to the which also ye are called in one body; and be ye thankful. Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly in all wisdom; teaching and admonishing one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing with grace in your hearts to the Lord. And whatsoever ye do in word or deed, do all in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God and the Father by him.” —Colossians 3:15-17 “Continue in prayer, and watch in the same with thanksgiving.” —Colossians 4:2 “I thank my God upon every remembrance of you, always in every prayer of mine for you all making request with joy.” —Philippians 1:3-4 “In every thing give thanks: for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus concerning you.” —1 Thessalonians. 5:18 The Bible teaches that every good thing comes from our Father (James 1:17), so praise, gratitude, and thanksgiving have a place in every prayer. There will be circumstances in which these may be harder to express, but Paul tells us that “all things work together for good to those who love God” (Romans 8:28). Note that he doesn’t say “some things” or “most things,” but “all.” This means that God will use even the greatest tragedy for good—just look at the cross, where Jesus hung, rejected and crucified by the very people He came to save. Nothing we will ever experience comes close to what He endured on the cross. He took the sword first and blunted its edge for us. What is the purpose of prayer? “Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done in earth, as it is in heaven.” —Matthew 6:10 “Let this mind be in you, which was also in Christ Jesus.” —Philippians 2:5 “That he would grant you, according to the riches of his glory, to be strengthened with might by his Spirit in the inner man; that Christ may dwell in your hearts by faith; that ye, being rooted and grounded in love, may be able to comprehend with all saints what is the breadth, and length, and depth, and height; and to know the love of Christ, which passeth knowledge, that ye might be filled with all the fulness of God.” —Ephesians 3:16-19 “Behold, I stand at the door, and knock: if any man hear my voice, and open the door, I will come in to him, and will sup with him, and he with me.” —Revelation 3:20 Prayer leads us into harmony with the mind of Jesus and into deeper fellowship with Him. It is said that we are the sum of the people we spend the most time with because we often begin to imitate them. Prayer, along with Bible study, is how we spend time with Jesus. Bible study is how He speaks to us, and prayer is how we speak to Him. Without daily, quality time, every relationship will eventually fall apart—including our relationship with Christ. Does prayer help resist temptation? “Watch ye and pray, lest ye enter into temptation. The spirit truly is ready, but the flesh is weak.” —Mark 14:38 “Take ye heed, watch and pray: for ye know not when the time is.” —Mark 13:33 “Watch ye therefore, and pray always, that ye may be accounted worthy to escape all these things that shall come to pass, and to stand before the Son of man.” —Luke 21:36 “But the end of all things is at hand: be ye therefore sober, and watch unto prayer.” —1 Peter 4:7 When we are tempted, the last thing we often want to do is pray, but connecting with God in that crucial moment is key, and it’s best to continue praying until the temptation passes. As long as we hold on to God, we cannot be overcome. Praying before the temptation comes, as demonstrated in Jesus’ model prayer, is also wise: “and lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil” (Matthew 6:13). If we are willing to be vigilant and avoid situations we know will tempt us, God will do His part to help us. The good news is there is a way of escape from every temptation, as God will never allow us to be tempted beyond what we are able to bear (1 Corinthians 10:13). Had Jesus’ disciples heeded His call to watch and pray in Gethsemane, there is no doubt they would have been strengthened to better endure what was about to come upon both Him and them. And poor Peter—would he have denied his Lord if he had spent that time in prayer instead of sleeping? Does prayer enable laziness? “Give us this day our daily bread.” —Matthew 6:11 “And when the dew that lay was gone up, behold, upon the face of the wilderness there lay a small round thing, as small as the hoar frost on the ground. And when the children of Israel saw it, they said one to another, It is manna: for they wist not what it was. And Moses said unto them, This is the bread which the LORD hath given you to eat. This is the thing which the LORD hath commanded, Gather of it every man according to his eating, an omer for every man, according to the number of your persons; take ye every man for them which are in his tents.” —Exodus 16:14-16 When God provided manna for the Israelites, it didn’t simply fall into their mouths; they still had to go out and gather it. God wants us to cooperate with Him by investing ourselves in the process; otherwise, we risk becoming lazy with His blessings. The simple truth is that He will never do for us what we can do for ourselves, but once we have done our part, He will do what we cannot. Where should I pray? “But you, when you pray, go into your room, and when you have shut your door, pray to your Father who is in the secret place; and your Father who sees in secret will reward you openly.” —Matthew 6:6, NKJV “And in the morning, rising up a great while before day, he went out, and departed into a solitary place, and there prayed.” —Mark 1:35 The best places for prayer are quiet and free from distractions, allowing us to focus fully on communing with our heavenly Father. In contrast, the Pharisees of Jesus’ day loved to pray publicly in order to be seen by others, but Christ calls us to seek Him humbly and in private. Of course, there is a time and place for corporate prayer—such as a church service or a small group—but our personal prayers should be between us and God alone. Should my prayers be repetitive? “But when ye pray, use not vain repetitions, as the heathen do: for they think that they shall be heard for their much speaking.” —Matthew 6:7 “And ye shall seek me, and find me, when ye shall search for me with all your heart.” —Jeremiah 29:13 “Confess your faults one to another, and pray one for another, that ye may be healed. The effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man availeth much.” —James 5:16 Jesus associated the repetition of words and phrases with paganism (Acts 19:34; 1 Kings 18:26), thereby making it clear that such practices have no place in the life of a Christian. The same is true of “breath prayers” and the popular practice of “entering the silence,” which often involves emptying the mind—disengaging the reasoning faculties—which is one of the quickest ways to enter an altered state of consciousness. Such practices often lead to mysticism and can open the door to the influence of malevolent spiritual powers. (For more information, see Howard Peth’s book The Dangers of Contemplative Prayer.) God desires that we be fully engaged when we speak with Him—just as we would be when talking to a close friend—with our minds alert and our reasoning intact (Isaiah 1:18). Prayer should be fresh, fervent, and from the heart. If our hearts are not in it, we probably should not be praying it. Prayers that do not mean much to us are unlikely to mean much to God. Is praying aloud a good idea? “Then they took away the stone from the place where the dead was laid. And Jesus lifted up his eyes, and said, Father, I thank thee that thou hast heard me. And I knew that thou hearest me always: but because of the people which stand by I said it, that they may believe that thou hast sent me.” —John 11:41 “And he went a little further, and fell on his face, and prayed, saying, O my Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me: nevertheless not as I will, but as thou wilt.” —Matthew 26:39 “And at midnight Paul and Silas prayed, and sang praises unto God: and the prisoners heard them.” —Acts 16:25 Jesus often prayed aloud, even in His personal prayers; otherwise, His disciples would not have heard them and recorded them for us. Paul and Silas also prayed aloud after they were imprisoned, and their witness for God led to the jailer’s conversion (Acts 16:29-30). Even in private, personal prayers between us and God, praying audibly can be helpful because it keeps us more focused and engaged. However, we should be careful to maintain our privacy in these moments, ensuring that only God hears us. What is the PRAY acronym? PRAY is an easy-to-remember acronym that can bring structure to our prayers. It stands for: - Praise - acknowledging God’s goodness. - Repent - confessing sins He has convicted us about. - Ask - presenting our requests to Him and interceding for others. - Yield - surrendering ourselves to Him in faith—our will, mind, heart, body, plans, abilities, and resources. Should I document God’s answers? “And thou shalt remember all the way which the LORD thy God led thee these forty years in the wilderness, to humble thee, and to prove thee, to know what was in thine heart, whether thou wouldest keep his commandments, or no.” —Deuteronomy 8:2 “Remember his marvellous works that he hath done, His wonders, and the judgments of his mouth.” —1 Chronicles 16:12 Because it’s easy to forget how God has answered our prayers in the past, it’s wise to write them down and revisit them from time to time. Rehearsing His blessings will do wonders to strengthen our faith in Him.",

What is it an echo of? “You are worthy, O Lord, to receive glory and honor and power; for You created all things, and by Your will they exist and were created.” —Revelation 4:11, NKJV Revelation 14:6-7 is an echo of the verse above, which explains that God is worthy to receive glory, honor, and power because He is the Author of all life. How did God create? “And to make all men see what is the fellowship of the mystery, which from the beginning of the world hath been hid in God, who created all things by Jesus Christ.” —Ephesians 3:9 “For by him [Jesus] were all things created, that are in heaven, and that are in earth, visible and invisible, whether they be thrones, or dominions, or principalities, or powers: all things were created by him, and for him: and he is before all things, and by him all things consist.” —Colossians 1:16-17 God the Father created all things by His Son Jesus, who was fulfilling the will of His Father, and by Him it all consists and holds together! Which commandment identifies the Creator God? “Remember the sabbath day, to keep it holy. Six days shalt thou labour, and do all thy work: but the seventh day is the sabbath of the LORD thy God: in it thou shalt not do any work, thou, nor thy son, nor thy daughter, thy manservant, nor thy maidservant, nor thy cattle, nor thy stranger that is within thy gates: for in six days the LORD made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that in them is, and rested the seventh day: wherefore the LORD blessed the sabbath day, and hallowed it.” —Exodus 20:8-11 The fourth commandment begins with the word “remember” because God knew His Sabbath would be forgotten. It then identifies Him as the Creator of all things, thus providing the reason He has a claim to our worship, which all who rest on the Sabbath day acknowledge. The Sabbath commandment also contains the three basic elements of a seal: name (“the Lord”), title (“your God”), and territory (“heaven and earth”). This uniquely identifies God as the author of the other nine commandments and establishes His authority. In other words, the authority of the Decalogue rests on the fourth commandment; without it, anyone could claim authorship of the other nine. What else can I learn about the Sabbath from Genesis 2? “Thus the heavens and the earth were finished, and all the host of them. And on the seventh day God ended his work which he had made; and he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had made. And God blessed the seventh day, and sanctified it: because that in it he had rested from all his work which God created and made.” —Genesis 2:1-3 The reason why the fourth commandment invites me to keep the Sabbath day holy is because God blessed this specific day and sanctified it. The word used in the original text is qadash, which means “to be set apart or consecrated.” In other words, the seventh day, is special to God and unlike any of the other six days of the week. Who is the Sabbath really for? “And he said unto them, The sabbath was made for man, and not man for the sabbath: therefore the Son of man is Lord also of the sabbath.” —Mark 2:27-28 “For thus saith the LORD unto the eunuchs that keep my sabbaths, and choose the things that please me, and take hold of my covenant; rven unto them will I give in mine house and within my walls a place and a name better than of sons and of daughters: I will give them an everlasting name, that shall not be cut off. Also the sons of the stranger, that join themselves to the LORD, to serve him, and to love the name of the LORD, to be his servants, every one that keepeth the sabbath from polluting it, and taketh hold of my covenant; even them will I bring to my holy mountain, and make them joyful in my house of prayer: their burnt offerings and their sacrifices shall be accepted upon mine altar; for mine house shall be called an house of prayer for all people.” —Isaiah 56:4-7 The Sabbath was made for all humanity. When God established the Sabbath, He did not need the rest it provided, for He does not grow weary (Isaiah 40:28). Nor had He labored in the way we do, since apart from forming Adam and Eve, His creative acts were accomplished simply by speaking. But humanity does grow weary from labor and therefore needs the rest the Sabbath provides. This is affirmed in the Old Testament, for Isaiah declares that the Sabbath was not only for the Israelites but also for the “strangers”—outsiders—who chose to “join themselves to the Lord.” Jesus, the Creator and Lord of the Sabbath, confirmed this same truth in the New Testament when He declared, “The Sabbath was made for man.” He could have said “for the Jews,” but He did not. Therefore, the commonly used expression “Jewish Sabbath” reflects either genuine ignorance or a serious misunderstanding of Scripture. Why was it given to us? “Moreover also I gave them my sabbaths, to be a sign between me and them, that they might know that I am the LORD that sanctify them. … And hallow my sabbaths; and they shall be a sign between me and you, that ye may know that I am the LORD your God.” —Ezekiel 20:12, 20 “And remember that thou wast a servant in the land of Egypt, and that the LORD thy God brought thee out thence through a mighty hand and by a stretched out arm: therefore the LORD thy God commanded thee to keep the sabbath day.” —Deuteronomy 5:15 The Sabbath is a sign of my acknowledgment that: 1. God is Lord because He created this world in six consecutive, literal, 24-hour days (Exodus 20:8, 11). The Sabbath is a weekly reminder that I have a Creator who desires to have a relationship with me. This truth carries several important implications: I am not self-created; I am not a god, nor can I become one; I possess no inherent divinity—no inner godhood or divine spark; I do not have an immortal soul, for only God is immortal (1 Timothy 6:15-16); and I did not come into existence by accident or through a long process of evolution. My life has meaning and purpose. 2. God is Lord of my life because He is the One who redeems and sanctifies me. In the Bible, the Israelites’ bondage in Egypt symbolizes the spiritual bondage of sin from which God delivers me. Therefore, the Sabbath is a weekly reminder that, in Jesus, victory over sin is available to all. After all, Jesus would not have told the woman caught in adultery to “go and sin no more” if that were impossible (John 8:11). Moreover, the Sabbath is a sign that I am not saved by my own works, but by faith in His completed work on the cross, as well as His ongoing work as my Intercessor in the heavenly sanctuary. In Eden, God rested on the seventh day from His work of creation, and in the tomb, Jesus rested on the same day from His work of redemption. Therefore, the Sabbath serves as a memorial of both acts. It is a weekly rest in Jesus, during which I set aside my secular work and worldly duties to connect with and honor Him—no matter how busy life may become. Did Jesus keep the Sabbath? “And he came to Nazareth, where he had been brought up: and, as his custom was, he went into the synagogue on the sabbath day, and stood up for to read.” —Luke 4:16 “And came down to Capernaum, a city of Galilee, and taught them on the sabbath days.” —Luke 4:31 “And they went into Capernaum; and straightway on the sabbath day he entered into the synagogue, and taught.” —Mark 1:21 “And when the sabbath day was come, he began to teach in the synagogue: and many hearing him were astonished, saying, From whence hath this man these things? and what wisdom is this which is given unto him, that even such mighty works are wrought by his hands?” —Mark 6:2 Luke tells us that going to the synagogue on the Sabbath day was a habit, not just an occasional occurrence, for Jesus. Did His followers keep it? “And that day was the preparation, and the sabbath drew on. And the women also, which came with him from Galilee, followed after, and beheld the sepulchre, and how his body was laid. And they returned, and prepared spices and ointments; and rested the sabbath day according to the commandment.” —Luke 23:54-56 “Now upon the first day of the week, very early in the morning, they came unto the sepulchre, bringing the spices which they had prepared, and certain others with them.” —Luke 24:1 The Bible is clear that His followers kept the Sabbath. In fact, they even stopped their work of anointing His body in order to keep it according to the commandment. They ended up coming back on Sunday, the first day of the week, after the Sabbath was over, to finish their work. Did Jesus expect it to be kept after His resurrection? “But pray ye that your flight be not in the winter, neither on the sabbath day.” —Matthew 24:20 Jesus warned about the destruction of Jerusalem by Rome, which occured in A.D. 70, and made it clear that the Sabbath would be kept long after His resurrection. Did His followers keep it after His resurrection? “And he reasoned in the synagogue every sabbath, and persuaded the Jews and the Greeks.” —Acts 18:4 “And when the Jews were gone out of the synagogue, the Gentiles besought that these words might be preached to them the next sabbath. Now when the congregation was broken up, many of the Jews and religious proselytes followed Paul and Barnabas: who, speaking to them, persuaded them to continue in the grace of God. And the next sabbath day came almost the whole city together to hear the word of God.” —Acts 13:42-44 “And Paul, as his manner was, went in unto them, and three sabbath days reasoned with them out of the scriptures.” —Acts 17:2 “But when they departed from Perga, they came to Antioch in Pisidia, and went into the synagogue on the Sabbath day, and sat down.” —Acts 13:14 Christ’s apostles kept the Sabbath themselves and taught others to do the same, including the converted Gentiles. On what day was John, the Revelator, in the Spirit? “I was in the Spirit on the Lord’s day, and heard behind me a great voice, as of a trumpet.” —Revelation 1:10 What is the Lord’s Day? “For the Son of man is Lord even of the sabbath day.” —Matthew 12:8 “And hallow my sabbaths; and they shall be a sign between me and you, that ye may know that I am the LORD your God.” —Ezekiel 20:20 “Speak thou also unto the children of Israel, saying, Verily my sabbaths ye shall keep: for it is a sign between me and you throughout your generations; that ye may know that I am the LORD that doth sanctify you.” —Exodus 31:13 God is Lord of the Sabbath, the seventh day (Exodus 20:11). Notice that He calls these days “My Sabbaths,” meaning it is His special day, which He blessed and sanctified to be a sign between Him and His people of His creative, redeeming, and sanctifying power. Does God change His ways? “Jesus Christ the same yesterday, and to day, and for ever.” —Hebrews 13:8 “Every good gift and every perfect gift is from above, and cometh down from the Father of lights, with whom is no variableness, neither shadow of turning.” —James 1:17 “My covenant will I not break, nor alter the thing that is gone out of my lips.” —Psalm 89:34 “And it is easier for heaven and earth to pass, than one tittle of the law to fail.” —Luke 16:17 “Heaven and earth shall pass away: but my words shall not pass away.” —Luke 21:33 God is not a fallible man who makes mistakes, changes His mind, or alters His commandments. The Decalogue is a transcript of His character and, as such, it can never be altered, which is good news, because it means His righteous and loving character will never change! Although some have claimed that His commandments have been altered—and the Bible predicted such attempts—the truth remains that His commandments are unchangeable. Will the Sabbath be kept in heaven? “For as the new heavens and the new earth, which I will make, shall remain before me, saith the LORD, so shall your seed and your name remain. And it shall come to pass, that from one new moon to another, and from one sabbath to another, shall all flesh come to worship before me, saith the LORD.” —Isaiah 66:22-23 The Sabbath will continue to be kept in heaven as a beautiful weekly testament to God’s power to fully redeem fallen humanity from a world of sin and to sanctify them for a new life in heaven. In heaven, it will also take on a new dimension as a memorial of His power to redeem the world itself from the curse of sin after He recreates it anew!",

Amen.” —Matthew 28:19-20 “The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the communion of the Holy Ghost, be with you all.” —2 Corinthians 13:14 The Holy Spirit is part of the Godhead, also referred to as the Trinity, that consists of three distinct Persons: the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. These three Persons are united in perfect harmony as one God (Isaiah 46:9). In the Old Testament there are multiple instances where this unity in plurality is shown (Genesis 1:26; 3:22; 11:7; Isaiah 6:8). Another example is Jesus’ baptism, when all three members of the Godhead were present: the Son of God was baptized, the Father spoke, and the Holy Spirit descended (Matthew 3:16-17). Is the Holy Spirit a person? “But Peter said, Ananias, why hath Satan filled thine heart to lie to the Holy Ghost, and to keep back part of the price of the land? Whiles it remained, was it not thine own? and after it was sold, was it not in thine own power? why hast thou conceived this thing in thine heart? thou hast not lied unto men, but unto God.” —Acts 5:3-4 “Howbeit when he, the Spirit of truth, is come, he will guide you into all truth: for he shall not speak of himself; but whatsoever he shall hear, that shall he speak: and he will shew you things to come.” —John 16:13 “And he that searcheth the hearts knoweth what is the mind of the Spirit, because he maketh intercession for the saints according to the will of God.” —Romans 8:27 Peter made it clear that the Holy Spirit is not only God, but He can also be lied to, which means He’s a Person with a personality, not an impersonal “force.” Paul confirmed this when he stated that the Spirit has a mind. Jesus, also, referred to the Spirit as “He”—an individual Being who works in harmony with the Godhead. What did Jesus promise before His ascension? “Nevertheless I tell you the truth; It is expedient for you that I go away: for if I go not away, the Comforter will not come unto you; but if I depart, I will send him unto you.” —John 16:7 “And I will pray the Father, and he shall give you another Comforter, that he may abide with you for ever. Even the Spirit of truth; whom the world cannot receive, because it seeth him not, neither knoweth him: but ye know him; for he dwelleth with you, and shall be in you. I will not leave you comfortless: I will come to you.” —John 14:16-17 “And he that keepeth his commandments dwelleth in him, and he in him. And hereby we know that he abideth in us, by the Spirit which he hath given us.” —1 John 3:24 Jesus promised that after His ascension He would send us the Comforter, the Holy Spirit, who’s abiding presence would comfort us. Notice also that when Jesus said the Holy Spirit would dwell in us, He followed that up with “I will come to you,” meaning Jesus equates the presence of the Spirit with His own presence! He Himself lives and abides in us through the Holy Spirit. When Jesus was on earth, people wanting to be with Him had to physically seek Him out, but we no longer have these limitations! Jesus can be anywhere and with anyone through the Person of the Holy Spirit. What is the Holy Spirit’s role? “Howbeit when he, the Spirit of truth, is come, he will guide you into all truth: for he shall not speak of himself; but whatsoever he shall hear, that shall he speak: and he will shew you things to come. He shall glorify me: for he shall receive of mine, and shall shew it unto you.” —John 16:13-14 “But the Comforter, which is the Holy Ghost, whom the Father will send in my name, he shall teach you all things, and bring all things to your remembrance, whatsoever I have said unto you.” —John 14:26 “Now we have received, not the spirit of the world, but the spirit which is of God; that we might know the things that are freely given to us of God. Which things also we speak, not in the words which man’s wisdom teacheth, but which the Holy Ghost teacheth; comparing spiritual things with spiritual. But the natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God: for they are foolishness unto him: neither can he know them, because they are spiritually discerned.” —1 Corinthians 2:12-14 Paul tells us that spiritual things are spiritually discerned (1 Corinthians 2:14), so one of the roles of the Holy Spirit is to teach and guide those studying the Bible into an understanding of its beautiful, freely given, truths because the Bible was written under the inspiration of the Spirit (2 Timothy 3:16; 2 Peter 1:21). Without the aid of the Spirit, the Bible cannot be understood, which is why it’s crucial to pray for the Holy Spirit’s guidance whenever we read it. Notice also that John says the Spirit does not speak independently of Jesus; on the contrary, He’s in harmony with the teachings of Jesus, working to give us an understanding of them. What else does the Spirit do? “And when he is come, he will reprove the world of sin, and of righteousness, and of judgment.” —John 16:8 “But when the Comforter is come, whom I will send unto you from the Father, even the Spirit of truth, which proceedeth from the Father, he shall testify of me.” —John 15:26 “Likewise the Spirit also helpeth our infirmities: for we know not what we should pray for as we ought: but the Spirit itself maketh intercession for us with groanings which cannot be uttered. And he that searcheth the hearts knoweth what is the mind of the Spirit, because he maketh intercession for the saints according to the will of God.” —Romans 8:26-27 The Holy Spirit reproves, or brings conviction, of sin, of righteousness, and of judgment. In other words, He identifies what is right and wrong in the sight of God, enabling us to experience spiritual growth and an increased love of God, His righteousness, and holy living. Put simply, the Holy Spirit is the catalyst that brings power, victory, and life to the Christian walk. These life changes might seem impossible to us, but, if we are willing to cooperate with the Holy Spirit, nothing is impossible to God (Mark 10:26-27; Philippians 2:13). The Holy Spirit also testifies of Jesus, revealing His character and truth to us, which, if received, has the power to sanctify our own characters (John 14:6; 17:17). And whenever we pray, it’s the Holy Spirit who inspires our petitions, if we let Him, so that they are in accordance to God’s will. To what extent do I need the Spirit? “And be not drunk with wine, wherein is excess; but be filled with the Spirit.” —Ephesians 5:18 “For John truly baptized with water; but ye shall be baptized with the Holy Ghost not many days hence.” —Acts 1:5 God wants us to be filled, or baptized, with the Holy Spirit. The word “filled” can be translated as “to fill up,” indicating that it’s not just a partial filling. How do I receive the Holy Spirit? “If ye then, being evil, know how to give good gifts unto your children: how much more shall your heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to them that ask him?” —Luke 11:13 “Let this mind be in you, which was also in Christ Jesus.” —Philippians 2:5 All I need to do to receive the Holy Spirit is ask God for it! He wants to bestow the Holy Spirit on all, but He will not do it against anyone’s will, which is why I need to ask. Asking only comes after there’s been a realization of my need of the Spirit, which means there is a heart that’s surrendered to God, dead to self, willing to receive. Paul uses the word “let” to describe the process of receiving the mind of Christ, meaning there is a willingness to yield—to surrender—to the sanctifying work of the Holy Spirit. And it truly is His work, not ours, because we cannot change ourselves, but we must be willing to cooperate with Him. What happens when one is filled with the Spirit? “But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, longsuffering, gentleness, goodness, faith, meekness, temperance: against such there is no law. And they that are Christ’s have crucified the flesh with the affections and lusts. If we live in the Spirit, let us also walk in the Spirit. Let us not be desirous of vain glory, provoking one another, envying one another.” —Galatians 5:22-26 “This I say then, Walk in the Spirit, and ye shall not fulfil the lust of the flesh.” —Galatians 5:16 A life that is filled with the Holy Spirit will produce the fruits of the Spirit, which are the attributes of Jesus, while the carnal, selfish nature will be crucified, or surrendered, to Christ. Notice that these are the fruits of the Spirit, not our own fruits, because we cannot produce them ourselves. What does the Spirit have power to do? “And the earth was without form, and void; and darkness was upon the face of the deep. And the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters.” —Genesis 1:2 “A new heart also will I give you, and a new spirit will I put within you: and I will take away the stony heart out of your flesh, and I will give you an heart of flesh. And I will put my spirit within you, and cause you to walk in my statutes, and ye shall keep my judgments, and do them.” —Ezekiel 36:26-27 “Not by works of righteousness which we have done, but according to his mercy he saved us, by the washing of regeneration, and renewing of the Holy Ghost; which he shed on us abundantly through Jesus Christ our Saviour.” —Titus 3:5-6 “Jesus answered, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born of water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God. That which is born of the flesh is flesh; and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit. Marvel not that I said unto thee, Ye must be born again. The wind bloweth where it listeth [wishes], and thou hearest the sound thereof, but canst not tell whence it cometh, and whither it goeth: so is every one that is born of the Spirit.” —John 3:5-8 Just like the Holy Spirit participated in the work of creation on that first week, He participates in the work of recreating the heart, renewing the mind, and transforming the character after the likeness of Jesus. When the Holy Spirit dwells in us, He will give us a new heart, enabling us to keep God’s commandments and live a genuine, victorious, joyful Christian life. This transplant of the heart is what Jesus referred to when He told Nicodemus that no one can enter the kingdom of God unless born of the Spirit. Like the movement of the wind, the work of the Holy Spirit upon the heart is a mystery to us, but just like the movement of the wind is made evident by its sound, the work of the Spirit will be made evident by its fruits in a person’s life. What is the baptism of the Holy Spirit? “For John truly baptized with water; but ye shall be baptized with the Holy Ghost not many days hence.” —Acts 1:5 “And when the day of Pentecost was fully come, they were all with one accord in one place. And suddenly there came a sound from heaven as of a rushing mighty wind, and it filled all the house where they were sitting. And there appeared unto them cloven tongues like as of fire, and it sat upon each of them. And they were all filled with the Holy Ghost, and began to speak with other tongues, as the Spirit gave them utterance.” —Acts 2:1-4 “Then Peter said unto them, Repent, and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins, and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost.” —Acts 2:38 Jesus’ promise to send the Holy Spirit was fulfilled on the Day of Pentecost when the disciples were filled, or baptized, with the Spirit, receiving various supernatural gifts that enabled them to proclaim the gospel with power. Peter made it clear that God’s genuine followers today are also prepared for service through the same outpouring of the Holy Spirit (Ephesians 4:11-13) when they repent and are baptized. And just like the outpouring during Pentecost, there will be another outpouring of the Spirit in the last days, just before Christ’s return, that will enable God’s followers to preach the gospel with power and give the final warning to the world (Acts 3:19-21; Joel 2:28-29). Will the Spirit participate in the resurrection? “But if the Spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you, he that raised up Christ from the dead shall also quicken your mortal bodies by his Spirit that dwelleth in you.” —Romans 8:11 The Holy Spirit will participate in the resurrection of God’s faithful followers, just like He participated in the resurrection of Christ. If we are Christ’s, there is no need to fear death because Jesus, who conquered death, will resurrect His people through the power of the Holy Spirit at His second coming. What are the gifts of the Spirit? “Now there are diversities of gifts, but the same Spirit. And there are differences of administrations, but the same Lord. And there are diversities of operations, but it is the same God which worketh all in all. But the manifestation of the Spirit is given to every man to profit withal. ““For to one is given by the Spirit the word of wisdom; to another the word of knowledge by the same Spirit; to another faith by the same Spirit; to another the gifts of healing by the same Spirit; to another the working of miracles; to another prophecy; to another discerning of spirits; to another divers kinds of tongues; to another the interpretation of tongues: but all these worketh that one and the selfsame Spirit, dividing to every man severally [separately] as he will.” —1 Corinthians 12:4-11 “And he gave some, apostles; and some, prophets; and some, evangelists; and some, pastors and teachers; for the perfecting of the saints, for the work of the ministry, for the edifying of the body of Christ: till we all come in the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of God, unto a perfect man, unto the measure of the stature of the fulness of Christ.” —Ephesians 4:11-13 “Having then gifts differing according to the grace that is given to us, whether prophecy, let us prophesy according to the proportion of faith; or ministry, let us wait on our ministering: or he that teacheth, on teaching; or he that exhorteth, on exhortation: he that giveth, let him do it with simplicity; he that ruleth, with diligence; he that sheweth mercy, with cheerfulness.” —Romans 12:6-8 The Holy Spirit bestows various spiritual gifts on believers to edify the members of the church as well as to minister to those outside of the church. These can be obvious miraculous talents, but they also include already existing ones that the Spirit then develops. The Holy Spirit distributes these gifts as He wills, and every believer receives at least one. What does “speaking in tongues” mean? “And they were all filled with the Holy Ghost, and began to speak with other tongues, as the Spirit gave them utterance. And there were dwelling at Jerusalem Jews, devout men, out of every nation under heaven. Now when this was noised abroad, the multitude came together, and were confounded, because that every man heard them speak in his own language. ““And they were all amazed and marvelled, saying one to another, Behold, are not all these which speak Galilaeans? And how hear we every man in our own tongue, wherein we were born? Parthians, and Medes, and Elamites, and the dwellers in Mesopotamia, and in Judaea, and Cappadocia, in Pontus, and Asia, Phrygia, and Pamphylia, in Egypt, and in the parts of Libya about Cyrene, and strangers of Rome, Jews and proselytes, Cretes and Arabians, we do hear them speak in our tongues the wonderful works of God.” —Acts 2:4-11 “So likewise ye, except ye utter by the tongue words easy to be understood, how shall it be known what is spoken? for ye shall speak into the air. … Yet in the church I had rather speak five words with my understanding, that by my voice I might teach others also, than ten thousand words in an unknown tongue. … ““If any man speak in an unknown tongue, let it be by two, or at the most by three, and that by course; and let one interpret. But if there be no interpreter, let him keep silence in the church; and let him speak to himself, and to God. Let the prophets speak two or three, and let the other judge. If any thing be revealed to another that sitteth by, let the first hold his peace. For ye may all prophesy one by one, that all may learn, and all may be comforted. And the spirits of the prophets are subject to the prophets. For God is not the author of confusion, but of peace, as in all churches of the saints.” —1 Corinthians 14:9, 19, 27-33 “But ye shall receive power, after that the Holy Ghost is come upon you: and ye shall be witnesses unto me both in Jerusalem, and in all Judaea, and in Samaria, and unto the uttermost part of the earth.” —Acts 1:8 Jesus said that the gifts and the filling of the Holy Spirit are for the purpose of witnessing to other people. This was examplified at Pentacost because one of the gifts of the Spirit was an ability to speak other tongues, or languages, and since there were people present in Jerusalem from other nations, the gift was needed so that the gospel could be communicated without any language barriers. The book of Acts mentions tongues only three times (Acts 2:4-11; 10:44-46; 19:4-6), and the Greek word for “tongues” in each of these three instances is the same word used for “tongues” in Revelation 14:6, which means real languages. In 1 Corinthians Paul sheds more light on the subject. He emphasizes that tongues should be spoken that can be understood by those present, and if an unknown tongue is spoken, an interpreter should be used. He then concludes his remarks by making it clear that God is not the author of confusion. So speaking in tongues is a gift of the Spirit that gives a person the ability to speak another language, when that need is present, for the proclamation of the gospel. What warning is given regarding the Holy Spirit? “And the LORD said, My spirit shall not always strive with man, for that he also is flesh: yet his days shall be an hundred and twenty years.” —Genesis 6:3 “And grieve not the Holy Spirit of God, whereby ye are sealed unto the day of redemption.” —Ephesians 4:30 Because the Holy Spirit is a Person, He can be grieved, and when this happens, He stops striving with us, meaning He stops convicting us of sin and of righteousness, no longer leading us to abandon the things that are offensive to God (sins of commission) or to do what is right in the sight of God, which can turn into sins of omission, if refused. Grieving away the Holy Spirit is a frightful position to be in because once He ceases to invite a person to come to Christ there is no hope of salvation left. The Bible compares the Holy Spirit’s revelations of Bible truth with receiving light. As the Holy Spirit guides us into an understanding of Bible truth, and we choose to walk in that revealed light, God will continue giving us more light (Proverbs 4:18-19), but a persistent rejection of revealed truth can lead to the extinguishing of light, leaving us in the spiritual darkness of error (John 12:35). Paul describes this process as quenching the Spirit (1 Thessalonians 5:19), similar to how water quenches fire. In fact, Paul later warns that this quenching can lead to a delusion where error is accepted as truth (2 Thessalonians 2:10-12), which leads to the experience described in Matthew 7:22-23 where Jesus says “I never knew you” to those who thought they were saved but, actually, were lost because they had quenched the Spirit. In Matthew 7:21 Jesus says only those who do the will of His Father will enter the kingdom of heaven, so any teaching of “salvation in sin“ is not from God because it rejects the need of Jesus (as does “salvation by works“). A genuine acceptance of Jesus as Lord and Savior, that is motivated by love and gratitute, always leads to a changed lifestyle that is in harmony with His will, which is salvation from sin by faith in Jesus’ power to forgive, save, and transform (2 Corinthians 5:17; John 14:15). Who choose to obey Him because we are saved, not to be saved. What is blasphemy against the Spirit? “Wherefore I say unto you, All manner of sin and blasphemy shall be forgiven unto men: but the blasphemy against the Holy Ghost shall not be forgiven unto men. And whosoever speaketh a word against the Son of man, it shall be forgiven him: but whosoever speaketh against the Holy Ghost, it shall not be forgiven him, neither in this world, neither in the world to come.” —Matthew 12:31-32 We’ve learned that one of the roles of the Holy Spirit is to convict us of sin, and the Bible makes it clear that any sin that is confessed will be forgiven by Jesus (1 John 1:9). Blasphemy against the Holy Spirit, which cannot be forgiven, also known as the unpardonable sin, is a continual resisting or rejection of the Holy Spirit’s convicting, converting power, which leads to sins that are left unconfessed and, therefore, cannot be forgiven. This is why David, after committing the sin of adultery and murder, prayed that God would not take His Holy Spirit from him (Psalm 51:11) because he knew that only the Spirit was able to lead him to repentance and a transformation of heart. God is patient, continuing to plead even with resistant people, but He won’t force Himself on anyone, and there will come a time when His pleading will cease (Genesis 6:3), if continually resisted. Each refusal to surrender to the Holy Spirit’s convictions creates a more hardened heart that is less sensitive to future conviction, and if this is continued, the Spirit will eventually depart, leaving that person to live with the cherished, uncofessed sin for good. It’s unknown how long it takes to reach the point of no return, but one thing is certain: it’s never safe to say “no” to the Holy Spirit. The only wise thing to do is to surrender to the convictions of the Spirit by confessing and forsaking the sin being pointed out (1 John 1:9). By the way, if you feel concerned you have rejected the Holy Spirit then that is evidence you have not. Is it safe to ignore conviction? “I made haste, and delayed not to keep thy commandments.” —Psalm 119:60 “For he saith, I have heard thee in a time accepted, and in the day of salvation have I succoured thee: behold, now is the accepted time; behold, now is the day of salvation.” —2 Corinthians 6:2 “And now why tarriest thou? arise, and be baptized, and wash away thy sins, calling on the name of the Lord.” —Acts 22:16 Tomorrow is never guaranteed, so waiting to act on the pleadings of the Holy Spirit is never wise. Let’s not repeat the mistake Felix made when he chose to wait for a more convenient time to act (Acts 24:25), which never came. The good news is every time we choose to respond to the Holy Spirit’s convictions we yield to the power of the Spirit to change the mind and heart, and if we continue to cooperate with Him, He will transform our character to reflect the character of Jesus. Who does the Holy Spirit glorify? “He shall glorify me: for he shall receive of mine, and shall shew it unto you.” —John 16:14 “He that speaketh of himself seeketh his own glory: but he that seeketh his glory that sent him, the same is true, and no unrighteousness is in him.” —John 7:18 Being Christ’s personal representative on earth, the Holy Spirit’s ministry is about drawing people to and glorifying Jesus, just as Christ’s ministry was about glorifying His Father (John 17:4). Those who have the genuine spiritual gifts of the Spirit will not seek to draw attention to themselves, their own teachings, or the things of the world; the focus will be on Jesus, His teachings, and His heavenly kingdom. What promises does the Bible give us? “For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, they are the sons of God.” —Romans 8:14 “My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me: and I give unto them eternal life; and they shall never perish, neither shall any man pluck them out of my hand.” —John 10:27-28 As we commit our lives to Jesus and follow His Spirit’s leading, we become sons and daughters of God. His promise to us is He will keep us on course, leading us to His kingdom!",

      "body": "What is the main motivator in a Christian’s life? “But God commendeth his love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us.” —Romans 5:8 “We love him, because he first loved us.” —1 John 4:19 Love for Christ is what moves a person to accept and follow Him. Without it, following Jesus turns into a burden. How is the Christian life and marriage similar? “And whatsoever we ask, we receive of him, because we keep his commandments, and do those things that are pleasing in his sight.” —2 Corinthians 5:20 Love for one’s spouse leads to a desire to please. That which is pleasing is practiced, and that which is displeasing is discontinued. The same is true in our relationship with Jesus. In His Word He outlines certain principles of conduct that please Him as well as those that displease Him, and a Christian who is filled with love for Jesus will find it a joy to do those things that make Him happy, while avoiding those that bring sorrow to His heart. What does pleasing God bring? “If ye keep my commandments, ye shall abide in my love; even as I have kept my Father’s commandments, and abide in his love. These things have I spoken unto you, that my joy might remain in you, and that your joy might be full.” —John 15:10-11 “The thief cometh not, but for to steal, and to kill, and to destroy: I am come that they might have life, and that they might have it more abundantly.” —John 10:10 God has given us certain principles because, as our Creator, He knows what is best for us. The enemy tries to portray these principles as legalistic and dull, because he wants us to stay away from them, but the truth is following them brings fullness of joy into the life. They are for our own good (Deuteronomy 6:24), safeguarding us from the danger of sin (Psalm 119:11), while also giving us the opportunity to express our love for Christ as we follow His example (John 14:15). What responsibility does a Christian have? “Now then we are ambassadors for Christ, as though God did beseech you by us: we pray you in Christ’s stead, be ye reconciled to God.” —2 Corinthians 5:20 “Now when they saw the boldness of Peter and John, and perceived that they were unlearned and ignorant men, they marvelled; and they took knowledge of them, that they had been with Jesus.” —Acts 4:13 “Go through, go through the gates; prepare ye the way of the people; cast up, cast up the highway; gather out the stones; lift up a standard for the people.” —Isaiah 62:10 Those who become followers of Christ become His ambassadors, representing Him wherever they go, whether in the family, at school, at work, or on vacation. Words and actions not only testify if the heart belongs to Christ, but they also have an influence on others. Jesus gave a solemn warning to Christians who are indifferent to their own example and influence (Matthew 18:6) as did Paul (Romans 14:7, 13). When people saw the conduct of Peter and John it was obvious to them that they were different because they had been with Jesus. May our walk with Christ transform us in like manner to reflect His character to those we come in contact with (Matthew 5:16). Does the Bible say about worldliness? “Love not the world, neither the things that are in the world. If any man love the world, the love of the Father is not in him. For all that is in the world, the lust of the flesh, and the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life, is not of the Father, but is of the world. And the world passeth away, and the lust thereof: but he that doeth the will of God abideth for ever.” —1 John 2:15-17 Every sin falls into one of three categories: 1) the lust of the flesh, 2) the lust of the eyes, or 3) the pride of life. These are the avenues through which Satan works to awaken in us a love for the world. Because we cannot serve two masters (Matthew 6:24), a love for the world decreases our love for God, whose principles are the exact opposite of those in the world, which is why James says that lovers of the world become enemies of God (James 4:4). We are called to be unspotted from the world (James 1:27) because the world, and its principles, will pass away, but the principles of God are eternal. What about conformity? “I beseech you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God, that ye present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God, which is your reasonable service. And be not conformed to this world: but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind, that ye may prove what is that good, and acceptable, and perfect, will of God.” —Romans 12:1-2 Living in a world of sin brings pressure to conform to its ways, to be squeezed into its mold, but God’s goal is to transform us by renewing our minds through the truth of His Word (John 17:17). Where does transformation start? “For as he thinketh in his heart, so is he.” —Proverbs 23:7 “But we all, with open face beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord, are changed into the same image from glory to glory, even as by the Spirit of the Lord.” —2 Corinthians 3:18 Transformation starts in the mind: thoughts turn into words, words into actions, actions into habits, and habits into character. Satan knows that we become what we repeatedly behold, which is why he has a myriad of ways to influence our thoughts through our five senses, but especially sight and hearing. Because we become what we see and hear, we are invited to behold the glory of God’s character by daily reading His letter to us—the Bible—so that we may become more like Him. What should I think about? “And the peace of God, which passeth all understanding, shall keep your hearts and minds through Christ Jesus. Finally, brethren, whatsoever things are true, whatsoever things are honest, whatsoever things are just, whatsoever things are pure, whatsoever things are lovely, whatsoever things are of good report; if there be any virtue, and if there be any praise, think on these things.” —Philippians 4:7-8 “Casting down imaginations, and every high thing that exalteth itself against the knowledge of God, and bringing into captivity every thought to the obedience of Christ.” —2 Corinthians 10:5 “Now the works of the flesh are manifest, which are these; adultery, fornication, uncleanness, lasciviousness, idolatry, witchcraft, hatred, variance, emulations, wrath, strife, seditions, heresies, envyings, murders, drunkenness, revellings, and such like: of the which I tell you before, as I have also told you in time past, that they which do such things shall not inherit the kingdom of God. But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, longsuffering, gentleness, goodness, faith, meekness, temperance: against such there is no law. And they that are Christ’s have crucified the flesh with the affections and lusts.” —Galatians 5:19-24 The above verses makes it clear there is little in modern entertainment that is fit for a Christian to watch. The list Paul provides in Philippians on the kind of thoughts we are to think about has implications on what a Christian will choose to avoid: - Dishonesty: lying, cheating, stealing, betrayal, or injustice. - Impurity: profanity, pornography, fornication, adultery, homosexuality, and watching or listening to anything that’s debasing. It’s unfortunate, but the lyrics of most secular songs glorify immoral behavior and numb our desire for spiritual things. Music is powerful because it bypasses the frontal lobe, the reasoning part of our brain, thereby appealing primarily to our emotions. It affects every function of the body, including pulse, breathing, and reflexes, but repetitive and syncopated rhythms, especially, alter mood and brain wave patterns, sending the listener into a type of hypnosis. At its best, music can be refreshing and uplifting, like it was to Saul when David played his harp (1 Samuel 16:23), but at its worst, it can be very degrading. Jesus wants to redeem us from the degradation of sin, and when we choose to follow Him, He will lead us to music that elevates, inspires, and refreshes. (For a deep dive into music, see the Distraction Dilemma seminar by Christian Berdahl.) Besides music, there is a second avenue into our mind: the things we watch. Do the TV shows, movies, and internet videos we watch increase our love for Jesus or the world? Do they promote the principles of His kingdom or those of the world? It’s no secret that the majority of modern entertainment falls into the latter category, and it is having an affect on society. One study found that without television “there would be 10,000 fewer murders per year in the United States, 70,000 fewer rapes, and 700,000 fewer assaults.” Time is finite and precious, so instead of beholding these vices, Jesus invites us to behold Him through, and be blessed by, the reading and study of His Word (Isaiah 45:22). Newsweek, “Violence, Reel to Reel”, Dec. 11, 1995, p. 47. Any other guidance? “The LORD trieth the righteous: but the wicked and him that loveth violence his soul hateth.” —Psalm 11:5 “Turn away mine eyes from beholding vanity; and quicken thou me in thy way.” —Psalm 119:37 “Let this mind be in you, which was also in Christ Jesus.” —Philippians 2:5 Instead of beholding vanity or violence, which are displeasing to God, we are invited to have the mind of Christ. It may seem like a high standard, but nothing is impossible to God (Mark 10:27). We can never accomplish it through our own power, but if we ask Him for it, He will give us a complete transformation of mind (1 Corinthians 6:9-11). Am I able to decide what is right? “Ye shall not do after all the things that we do here this day, every man whatsoever is right in his own eyes.” —Deuteronomy 12:8 “There is a way that seemeth right unto a man, but the end thereof are the ways of death.” —Proverbs 16:25 “The way of a fool is right in his own eyes: but he that hearkeneth unto counsel is wise.” —Proverbs 12:15 “Be not wise in thine own eyes: fear the LORD, and depart from evil. It shall be health to thy navel, and marrow to thy bones.” —Proverbs 3:7-8 Sin has so perverted our sensibility to what is right and wrong that, without God drawing a clear distinction between the two in His Word, we are incapable of making the distinction ourselves. The key question He would like us to ask is will this music, movie, TV show, or book honor You? How should I dress? “In like manner also, that the women adorn themselves in modest apparel, with propriety and moderation, not with braided hair or gold or pearls or costly clothing, but, which is proper for women professing godliness, with good works.” —1 Timothy 2:9-10, NKJV God’s counsel regarding clothing, which applies to both men and women, is modesty, propriety, and moderation. The key word is moderation, which means we are to avoid expensive clothes, but we are not to dress in sackcloth either. Our clothing should be clean, neat, and modest. What is a Christian’s true adornment? “While they behold your chaste conversation coupled with fear. Whose adorning let it not be that outward adorning of plaiting the hair, and of wearing of gold, or of putting on of apparel; but let it be the hidden man of the heart, in that which is not corruptible, even the ornament of a meek and quiet spirit, which is in the sight of God of great price.” —1 Peter 3:2-4 The ornaments God desires His people to wear are not outward ones; rather, it’s the adornment of the heart—possessing a character that reflects Jesus. What does God say about jewelry? “Moreover the LORD saith, Because the daughters of Zion are haughty, and walk with stretched forth necks and wanton eyes, walking and mincing as they go, and making a tinkling with their feet. Therefore the Lord will smite with a scab the crown of the head of the daughters of Zion, and the LORD will discover their secret parts. In that day the Lord will take away the bravery of their tinkling ornaments about their feet, and their cauls, and their round tires like the moon, the chains, and the bracelets, and the mufflers, the bonnets, and the ornaments of the legs, and the headbands, and the tablets, and the earrings, the rings, and nose jewels, the changeable suits of apparel, and the mantles, and the wimples, and the crisping pins, the glasses, and the fine linen, and the hoods, and the vails. And it shall come to pass, that instead of sweet smell there shall be stink; and instead of a girdle a rent; and instead of well set hair baldness; and instead of a stomacher a girding of sackcloth; and burning instead of beauty.” —Isaiah 3:16-24 God clearly shows His displeasure when His people, referred to as daughters of Zion, adorn themselves on the outside and lack the adornment that truly matters—the adornment of character. What is jewelry associated with? “And I will visit upon her the days of Baalim, wherein she burned incense to them, and she decked herself with her earrings and her jewels, and she went after her lovers, and forgat me, saith the LORD.” —Hosea 2:13 “Then Jacob said unto his household, and to all that were with him, Put away the strange gods that are among you, and be clean, and change your garments: and let us arise, and go up to Bethel; and I will make there an altar unto God, who answered me in the day of my distress, and was with me in the way which I went. And they gave unto Jacob all the strange gods which were in their hand, and all their earrings which were in their ears; and Jacob hid them under the oak which was by Shechem.” —Genesis 35:2-4 “Unto a land flowing with milk and honey: for I will not go up in the midst of thee; for thou art a stiffnecked people: lest I consume thee in the way. And when the people heard these evil tidings, they mourned: and no man did put on him his ornaments. For the LORD had said unto Moses, Say unto the children of Israel, Ye are a stiffnecked people: I will come up into the midst of thee in a moment, and consume thee: therefore now put off thy ornaments from thee, that I may know what to do unto thee. And the children of Israel stripped themselves of their ornaments by the mount Horeb.” —Exodus 33:3-6 In the Bible jewelry is associated with idolatry, backsliding, apostasy, and forgetting God. By its very nature, jewelry draws attention to and exalts self, thus appealing to pride (1 John 2:16). The putting away of jewelry, on the other hand, is associated with repentance and turning back to God. For example, when Jacob chose to rededicate his life to God, he told his family to destroy their idols and to remove their jewelry. When the Israelites mourned their apostasy of worshiping the golden calf, God told them to put away their jewelry, and they did. How is the apostate church of Revelation portrayed? “And there came one of the seven angels which had the seven vials, and talked with me, saying unto me, Come hither; I will shew unto thee the judgment of the great whore that sitteth upon many waters: with whom the kings of the earth have committed fornication, and the inhabitants of the earth have been made drunk with the wine of her fornication. So he carried me away in the spirit into the wilderness: and I saw a woman sit upon a scarlet coloured beast, full of names of blasphemy, having seven heads and ten horns. And the woman was arrayed in purple and scarlet colour, and decked with gold and precious stones and pearls, having a golden cup in her hand full of abominations and filthiness of her fornication: and upon her forehead was a name written, MYSTERY, BABYLON THE GREAT, THE MOTHER OF HARLOTS AND ABOMINATIONS OF THE EARTH.” —Revelation 17:1-5 “And he cried mightily with a strong voice, saying, Babylon the great is fallen, is fallen, and is become the habitation of devils, and the hold of every foul spirit, and a cage of every unclean and hateful bird. For all nations have drunk of the wine of the wrath of her fornication, and the kings of the earth have committed fornication with her, and the merchants of the earth are waxed rich through the abundance of her delicacies. And I heard another voice from heaven, saying, Come out of her, my people, that ye be not partakers of her sins, and that ye receive not of her plagues.” —Revelation 18:2-4 The apostate chuch of Revelation, having abandoned her loyalty to Jesus Christ, is shown as being decked with jewelry, which is in contrast to God’s true church of Revelation 12:1 clothed with the sun, a symbol of Jesus’ righteousness (Malachi 4:2). God later calls His people to separate from Babylon and everything it stands for, including jewelry, pomp, and the exaltation of self. Instead, we are called to be clothed with the garments of salvation and Christ’s righteousness (Isaiah 61:10). Is obedience legalism? “Know ye not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God? Be not deceived: neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor effeminate, nor abusers of themselves with mankind, nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor extortioners, shall inherit the kingdom of God. And such were some of you: but ye are washed, but ye are sanctified, but ye are justified in the name of the Lord Jesus, and by the Spirit of our God.” —1 Corinthians 6:9-11 “Thou believest that there is one God; thou doest well: the devils also believe, and tremble. But wilt thou know, O vain man, that faith without works is dead? Was not Abraham our father justified by works, when he had offered Isaac his son upon the altar? Seest thou how faith wrought with his works, and by works was faith made perfect? And the scripture was fulfilled which saith, Abraham believed God, and it was imputed unto him for righteousness: and he was called the Friend of God. Ye see then how that by works a man is justified, and not by faith only.” —James 2:19-24 “Even so every good tree bringeth forth good fruit; but a corrupt tree bringeth forth evil fruit. A good tree cannot bring forth evil fruit, neither can a corrupt tree bring forth good fruit. Every tree that bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down, and cast into the fire. Wherefore by their fruits ye shall know them.” —Matthew 7:17-20 We obey Him because we are saved, not to be saved. The Bible is clear we are saved by God’s grace through faith (Ephesians 2:8), and because there is nothing we can do to be saved, when we accept His free gift of redemption from sin, we develop gratitude and love for Jesus that naturally makes us want to please Him, just as Jesus lived to please His Father in everything He did (John 8:29). For a person who genuinely loves Christ it’s a joy to discover His will in the Bible and to follow it in all areas of life. A conversion without a transformation of character or change in lifestyle, on the other hand, is most likely not genuine because faith without works is dead. A tree is known by its fruit, and genuine faith will produce a life that is obedient to Christ in an expression of love for Him. Is the Christian life appealing to all? “But the natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God: for they are foolishness unto him: neither can he know them, because they are spiritually discerned.” —1 Corinthians 2:14 “For they that are after the flesh do mind the things of the flesh; but they that are after the Spirit the things of the Spirit. For to be carnally minded is death; but to be spiritually minded is life and peace. Because the carnal mind is enmity against God: for it is not subject to the law of God, neither indeed can be. So then they that are in the flesh cannot please God.” —Romans 8:5-8 The principles of Jesus are for those who are looking to be led by His Spirit. The world lacks spiritual discernment, so it will consider the things of God as foolishness. In fact, unconverted people would find heaven a bore because their love for worldly things could never be satisfied. This is why Jesus wants to change our tastes here on earth by calling us to be separate from the world (2 Corinthians 6:17) because the truth is we cannot serve two masters (Matthew 6:24). Many try to follow Christ while staying as close as possible to the world, but a house divided against itself cannot stand (Matthew 12:25). Moreover, Jesus will never withhold from us anything that is good (Psalm 84:11) but only those things that are harmful. We may not always understand why He asks us to do certain things, but motivated by love, we can give Him the benefit of the doubt, trusting that He always has our best interest in mind. What if changing my habits feels overwhelming? “And they were astonished out of measure, saying among themselves, Who then can be saved? And Jesus looking upon them saith, With men it is impossible, but not with God: for with God all things are possible.” —Mark 10:26-27 “Sanctify them through thy truth: thy word is truth.” —John 17:17 Changing our tastes and habits is often overwhelming, and the truth is we cannot do it ourselves, but if we are willing to change and have faith in God’s power to do it, He will give us a love for the pure, holy, and righteous. What He needs from us is a willingness to separate from the things of the world and a desire to draw close to Him by spending more time with Him in His Word, through which He can then sanctify us (John 17:17). The more time we spend with Him, the more we will love Him, and the more we will want to please Him. Having our consent, He will then have the freedom to change us into His image (2 Corinthians 3:18), and people will take notice that we had been with Jesus (Acts 4:13). What is Jesus’ desire for me? “Ye are the light of the world. A city that is set on an hill cannot be hid.” —Matthew 5:14 “I will greatly rejoice in the LORD, my soul shall be joyful in my God; for he hath clothed me with the garments of salvation, he hath covered me with the robe of righteousness, as a bridegroom decketh himself with ornaments, and as a bride adorneth herself with her jewels.” —Isaiah 61:10 “If ye know these things, happy are ye if ye do them.” —John 13:17 “I delight to do thy will, O my God: yea, thy law is within my heart.” —Psalm 40:8 Christ is looking for people who are willing to be fully surrendered to Him so that He can make them a light in a world that is only getting darker, people who are willing to be different, who want to be clothed with His garments of salvation and covered with His robe of rigtheousness. He is looking for a people who will rejoice in His redemption from, and victory over, sin in their lives, people who realize that true happiness, which is in such short supply in this world, comes from knowing and doing His will.",

      "body": "Is the Sabbath temporary or perpetual? “Wherefore the children of Israel shall keep the sabbath, to observe the sabbath throughout their generations, for a perpetual covenant. It is a sign between me and the children of Israel for ever: for in six days the LORD made heaven and earth, and on the seventh day he rested, and was refreshed. And he gave unto Moses, when he had made an end of communing with him upon mount Sinai, two tables of testimony, tables of stone, written with the finger of God.” —Exodus 31:16-18 The Ten Commandments, of which the Sabbath is a part, were written by the finger of God on tablets of stone rather than on materials subject to decay, such as wood or clay, as a testament to their timelessness (Matthew 5:17-18). Was the Sabbath for the Jewish people only? “Thus the heavens and the earth were finished, and all the host of them. And on the seventh day God ended his work which he had made; and he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had made. And God blessed the seventh day, and sanctified it: because that in it he had rested from all his work which God created and made.” —Genesis 2:1-3 “For as the new heavens and the new earth, which I will make, shall remain before me, saith the LORD, so shall your seed and your name remain. And it shall come to pass, that from one new moon to another, and from one sabbath to another, shall all flesh come to worship before me, saith the LORD.” —Isaiah 66:22-23 The seventh-day Sabbath was set apart, blessed, and sanctified in the very first week of creation, long before there was a Jewish nation, and it will be kept even in heaven as a testament to God as our Creator and Redeemer. The Sabbath was instituted in Eden for all humanity, and as long as we are His creation, whom He has redeemed, so long will the Sabbath stand. How many need sanctification? “For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God.” —Romans 3:23 “Moreover also I gave them my sabbaths, to be a sign between me and them, that they might know that I am the LORD that sanctify them.” —Ezekiel 20:12 Because all have sinned, all need the sanctifying power of Christ—of which the Sabbath is a sign; therefore, it cannot be a sign for the Jewish nation only, for sin is no respecter of persons, just as God’s power to sanctify is no respecter of sinners. As God set the Sabbath apart as a day for Himself, so He sets us apart as a people for Himself (1 Peter 2:9; 2 Corinthians 6:17-18). Is the Sabbath an antidote to salvation by works? “For he spake in a certain place of the seventh day on this wise, and God did rest the seventh day from all his works. … There remaineth therefore a rest to the people of God. For he that is entered into his rest, he also hath ceased from his own works, as God did from his. Let us labour therefore to enter into that rest, lest any man fall after the same example of unbelief.” —Hebrews 4:4-6, 9-11 The Sabbath is a memorial of God as both Creator and Redeemer. Just as He rested from His work of creation on the seventh day, so Jesus rested from His work of redemption in the tomb. The Sabbath, therefore, is a sign of resting in Christ by faith in His completed work on my behalf. In other words, to deny the Sabbath is, in essence, to deny salvation by faith. Because I cannot sanctify or save myself, I am invited to cease striving for salvation by my own works and to rest in the righteous life of Jesus instead. By resting on the seventh day, I acknowledge this sublime truth. What happened as the Sabbath approached after Jesus died? “And that day was the preparation, and the sabbath drew on. And the women also, which came with him from Galilee, followed after, and beheld the sepulchre, and how his body was laid. And they returned, and prepared spices and ointments; and rested the sabbath day according to the commandment.” —Luke 23:54-56 The Bible points out that, since it was the Day of Preparation (Friday) and the Sabbath was about to begin at sunset, Jesus’ followers were so concerned about keeping the Sabbath that they even stopped their labor of love in preparing the body of their beloved Savior for burial. They rested on the Sabbath, as commanded, and returned early on Sunday morning to resume their unfinished work. What happened on the first day? “Now upon the first day of the week, very early in the morning, they came unto the sepulchre, bringing the spices which they had prepared, and certain others with them.” —Luke 24:1 “In the end of the sabbath, as it began to dawn toward the first day of the week, came Mary Magdalene and the other Mary to see the sepulchre.” —Matthew 28:1 “And very early in the morning the first day of the week, they came unto the sepulchre at the rising of the sun.” —Mark 16:2 “The first day of the week cometh Mary Magdalene early, when it was yet dark, unto the sepulchre, and seeth the stone taken away from the sepulchre.” —John 20:1 It is important to note that Jesus’ followers returned to the tomb because they still had unfinished burial work to complete. Since they brought spices with them, it is evident they did not expect to find Him resurrected, so their Sunday morning labor of love was not an act of honoring His resurrection but rather a continuation of their burial work. Did Jesus command the keeping of Sunday? “Now when Jesus was risen early the first day of the week, he appeared first to Mary Magdalene, out of whom he had cast seven devils. And she went and told them that had been with him, as they mourned and wept.” —Mark 16:9 “Jesus saith unto her, Woman, why weepest thou? whom seekest thou? She, supposing him to be the gardener, saith unto him, Sir, if thou have borne him hence, tell me where thou hast laid him, and I will take him away. Jesus saith unto her, Mary. She turned herself, and saith unto him, Rabboni; which is to say, Master. Jesus saith unto her, Touch me not; for I am not yet ascended to my Father: but go to my brethren, and say unto them, I ascend unto my Father, and your Father; and to my God, and your God. Mary Magdalene came and told the disciples that she had seen the Lord, and that he had spoken these things unto her.” —John 20:15-18 After His resurrection, Jesus had multiple opportunities to instruct His followers to keep Sunday as the new Sabbath in honor of His resurrection, but this He never did. When He appeared to Mary Magdalene that morning, there was no mention of Sunday at all. Considering the many Old Testament passages in which God directly commands the observance of the seventh-day Sabbath, one would reasonably expect at least one verse in the New Testament where Jesus—or His Father—commands His followers to keep Sunday instead. Yet no such verse exists. All we have is alleged circumstantial evidence, which, when closely examined, falls apart as well. How do we honor Jesus’ resurrection? “Know ye not, that so many of us as were baptized into Jesus Christ were baptized into his death? Therefore we are buried with him by baptism into death: that like as Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the Father, even so we also should walk in newness of life. For if we have been planted together in the likeness of his death, we shall be also in the likeness of his resurrection: knowing this, that our old man is crucified with him, that the body of sin might be destroyed, that henceforth we should not serve sin. For he that is dead is freed from sin. Now if we be dead with Christ, we believe that we shall also live with him.” —Romans 6:3-8 Jesus instituted baptism by immersion as a symbol of His death, burial, and resurrection. In baptism, a person goes briefly under the water, representing death to sin and burial with Christ, and then rises out of the water to a new life in and for Christ. Didn’t the disciples break bread on the first day? “And upon the first day of the week, when the disciples came together to break bread, Paul preached unto them, ready to depart on the morrow; and continued his speech until midnight.” —Acts 20:7 “And they continued stedfastly in the apostles’ doctrine and fellowship, and in breaking of bread, and in prayers. … And they, continuing daily with one accord in the temple, and breaking bread from house to house, did eat their meat with gladness and singleness of heart.” —Acts 2:42, 46 The meeting in which bread was broken on the first day of the week occurred because Paul was leaving the next day. Apart from this unique circumstance, the meeting had no special significance, since the early Christians broke bread daily. What about John 20:19? “Mary Magdalene came and told the disciples that she had seen the Lord, and that he had spoken these things unto her. Then the same day at evening, being the first day of the week, when the doors were shut where the disciples were assembled for fear of the Jews, came Jesus and stood in the midst, and saith unto them, Peace be unto you. And when he had so said, he shewed unto them his hands and his side. Then were the disciples glad, when they saw the Lord. Then said Jesus to them again, Peace be unto you: as my Father hath sent me, even so send I you.” —John 20:18-21 “Afterward he appeared unto the eleven as they sat at meat, and upbraided them with their unbelief and hardness of heart, because they believed not them which had seen him after he was risen.” —Mark 16:14 Mark tells us that after Jesus’ disciples heard He had risen, they did not at first believe the reports, so later that same day He appeared to them in person. Since they did not believe He had risen, they could not have gathered to honor His resurrection. Moreover, after He appeared, He had the perfect opportunity to declare Sunday holy, but—just as in His interaction with Mary—He did not do so. Finally, according to the Bible, days begin at sunset (Genesis 1:5); thus, biblically—and for the Jews—this Sunday evening gathering would actually have been Monday. How about 1 Corinthians 16:2? “Now concerning the collection for the saints, as I have given order to the churches of Galatia, even so do ye. Upon the first day of the week let every one of you lay by him in store, as God hath prospered him, that there be no gatherings when I come. And when I come, whomsoever ye shall approve by your letters, them will I send to bring your liberality unto Jerusalem.” —1 Corinthians 16:1-3 In this passage, Paul is encouraging the Corinthians to remember their fellow believers in Judea, who were experiencing a famine (Acts 11:27-30), by putting money aside on Sunday, the day when financial matters were typically settled, after the Sabbath had passed, so that the funds would be ready when he visited them. The money was to be set aside privately, according to each person’s financial ability, and on a weekly basis rather than in a one-time donation, in order to encourage systematic giving. Nothing in these passages indicates that a worship gathering occurred on Sunday or that these offerings were collected during such a service. What about Romans 14:5-6? “One man esteemeth one day above another: another esteemeth every day alike. Let every man be fully persuaded in his own mind. He that regardeth the day, regardeth it unto the Lord; and he that regardeth not the day, to the Lord he doth not regard it. He that eateth, eateth to the Lord, for he giveth God thanks; and he that eateth not, to the Lord he eateth not, and giveth God thanks.” —Romans 14:5-6 Looking at the context, verse 1 shows that Paul is addressing “doubtful disputations” (Romans 14:1), meaning issues of personal preference related to ceremonial practices. Verses 2 and 3 offer further insight: the controversy was actually about fasting (Romans 14:2-3, 6). Some Jewish Christians thought all believers were obligated to fast on specific days; by contrast, Gentile Christians, who were unfamiliar with such ceremonial observances, had a different view. Seeking reconciliation, Paul urged them to stop passing judgment on one another in these matters. The Sabbath, however, cannot be considered a “doubtful disputation,” since it is not part of the ceremonial law; rather, it belongs to God’s unchanging, moral law—the Ten Commandments—established at creation. How about Colossians 2:16-17? “Let no man therefore judge you in meat, or in drink, or in respect of a holyday [festival], or of the new moon, or of the sabbath days: which are a shadow of things to come; but the body is of Christ.” —Colossians 2:16-17 The fact that the passage mentions food, drink, festivals, and new moons in connection with “sabbath days” indicates that, once again, it is referring to the ceremonial laws. These are described as “a shadow of things to come” because they all pointed forward to Christ. When the veil of the temple was supernaturally torn from top to bottom at Christ’s death, God signified that these ceremonial laws had met their fulfillment in His Son and were no longer needed (Ephesians 2:14-15), for the great sacrifice to which they all pointed had been made. In contrast to the Ten Commandments, which were written by God Himself on stone and placed inside the ark of the covenant (Deuteronomy 10:3-5), the ceremonial laws were written by Moses on parchment and placed beside the ark (Deuteronomy 31:24-26). The “sabbath days” mentioned as part of the ceremonial law refer to the yearly sabbaths described in Leviticus 23:24-38, not the weekly Sabbath that is part of the moral law. These annual sabbaths fell on specific days of the month each year (for example, the first, ninth, tenth, or fifteenth day), yet they were still called sabbaths because the people were to rest from their work on those days. What is the Lord’s day? “I was in the Spirit on the Lord’s day, and heard behind me a great voice, as of a trumpet.” —Revelation 1:10 “And he said unto them, The sabbath was made for man, and not man for the sabbath: Therefore the Son of man is Lord also of the sabbath.” —Mark 2:27-28 “But the seventh day is the sabbath of the LORD thy God: in it thou shalt not do any work, thou, nor thy son, nor thy daughter, thy manservant, nor thy maidservant, nor thy cattle, nor thy stranger that is within thy gates.” —Exodus 20:10 “Six days shall work be done: but the seventh day is the sabbath of rest, a holy convocation; ye shall do no work therein: it is the sabbath of the LORD in all your dwellings.” —Leviticus 23:3 Biblically, there is only one day that the Lord God claims as His own—the seventh-day Sabbath. Jesus affirmed this, and the fourth commandment clearly identifies it as such. Unfortunately, “the Lord’s day” is widely misinterpreted as referring to Sunday, even though there is no Scriptural evidence to support this. What did Jesus teach about the law? “Think not that I am come to destroy the law, or the prophets: I am not come to destroy, but to fulfil. For verily I say unto you, till heaven and earth pass, one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law, till all be fulfilled.” —Matthew 5:17-18 There are no verses in the Bible showing that Jesus changed the fourth commandment to mean observing Sunday instead of Saturday, nor did He instruct others to do so later on. On the contrary, His mission was to fulfill the law and to uphold and expand it beyond the mere “letter” of the law to include the “spirit” of the law as well. For instance, Jesus expanded the commandment against adultery to include lust (Matthew 5:28) and the commandment against murder to include hatred (Matthew 5:21-22). Law is the foundation of all government—both on earth and in heaven. Since Jesus does not change, His government, and therefore, His law, cannot change; otherwise, the wisdom, authority, and stability of His rule would immediately come into question. After all, if one of His commandments can change, why not the other nine? Most people agree with His prohibitions against having other gods, idolatry, blasphemy, dishonoring parents, murder, theft, adultery, bearing false witness, or covetousness. But what about the fourth commandment? Many acknowledge the need for weekly rest, yet the specific day on which to rest is often regarded as a matter of personal opinion. The Sabbath commandment is the only one that establishes God’s authority to give the other nine—by the simple fact that we are the created and He is the Creator. Furthermore, without the fourth commandment, anyone could have given the other nine. The Sabbath, therefore, stands as His signature upon the entire Decalogue. But does God really care about the day we honor? Yes, He does. Did He care about the tree from which Eve ate? Most definitely. Does He mean what He says? Absolutely. Ultimately, the day we choose to honor is both a test of obedience and a question of authority: whose authority will I acknowledge and submit to—God’s or someone else’s? It is a simple yet profound decision that every person must make.",

      "body": "Who is the true owner of everything on earth? “In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth.” —Genesis 1:1 “The earth is the LORD’S, and the fulness thereof; the world, and they that dwell therein.” —Psalm 24:1 “For every beast of the forest is mine, and the cattle upon a thousand hills. I know all the fowls of the mountains: and the wild beasts of the field are mine. If I were hungry, I would not tell thee: for the world is mine, and the fulness thereof.” —Psalm 50:10-12 The Bible teaches that the earth and everything in it belongs to God because He is its Creator; we are simply managers, or stewards, of His property and His goods (Matthew 25:14). From whom do financial blessings flow? “The silver is mine, and the gold is mine, saith the LORD of hosts.” —Haggai 2:8 “But thou shalt remember the LORD thy God: for it is he that giveth thee power to get wealth, that he may establish his covenant which he sware unto thy fathers, as it is this day.” —Deuteronomy 8:18 “Every good gift and every perfect gift is from above, and cometh down from the Father of lights, with whom is no variableness, neither shadow of turning.” —James 1:17 God is also the true owner of all the wealth of the world, and it is He who gives us power to obtain the wealth that we have. In fact, James says that God is the source of all our blessings, not just the financial ones. What percentage of income belongs to the Lord? “And all the tithe of the land, whether of the seed of the land, or of the fruit of the tree, is the LORD’S: it is holy unto the LORD. … And concerning the tithe of the herd, or of the flock, even of whatsoever passeth under the rod, the tenth shall be holy unto the LORD.” —Leviticus 27:30, 32 The Bible says that a tenth of our income belongs to God (the word “tithe” means “a tenth”). This means that when we tithe we aren’t making a gift but are simply returning what already belongs to Him. Tithing, perhaps more than anything else, tends to reveal the true posture of our heart, because when it truly belongs to Him, tithe is returned cheerfully (2 Corinthians 9:7), out of love and gratitude for Him and as an act of faith that He will continue to take care of us in the future. Some may think that they cannot afford to tithe, but the truth is a person cannot afford not to tithe. Because God has promised a blessing on those who tithe, the 90% that is blessed by God will go much father than the 100% without His blessing. God invites anyone who is unsure about tithing to put Him to the test and see how faithful He will be to His promise (Malachi 3:10). Incidentally, Adam and Eve failed the test of trusting God because, out of all the trees they could freely eat from, they took of the one that was not theirs. Similarly, all the blessings we have in life are from God (James 1:17), but He only claims a tenth of our income as His. In reality, it’s not our money that He wants, but our loyalty and trust, because when we tithe, we enter into a partnership with Him, acknowledging His blessings and trusting that He will continue to provide. What was the tithe instituted for? “And, behold, I have given the children of Levi all the tenth in Israel for an inheritance, for their service which they serve, even the service of the tabernacle of the congregation.” —Numbers 18:21 When the Israelites entered the Promised Land, the tribe of Levi received certain cities from God, but they did not receive a large plot of land to live off, like the other tribes did, because the tribe of Levi was set apart for ministry in the sanctuary, and so God arranged to support them with the tithe as their source of income. What about the ministers of today? “Do ye not know that they which minister about holy things live of the things of the temple? and they which wait at the altar are partakers with the altar? Even so hath the Lord ordained that they which preach the gospel should live of the gospel.” —1 Corinthians 9:13-14 “Bring ye all the tithes into the storehouse, that there may be meat [food] in mine house, and prove me now herewith, saith the LORD of hosts, if I will not open you the windows of heaven, and pour you out a blessing, that there shall not be room enough to receive it.” —Malachi 3:10 “For the Scripture says, “You shall not muzzle an ox while it treads out the grain,” and, “The laborer is worthy of his wages.”” —1 Timothy 5:18, NKJV Paul is clear that tithing is still God’s method of supporting the ministers of today as they dedicate their lives to the preaching of the gospel. This gives every follower of Jesus the privilege to participate in the blessing of spreading the gospel throughout the world. God confirms this in the book of Malachi when He invites His followers to bring their tithe into His storehouse so that it could be provisioned with food for the priests ministering in the temple (Nehemiah 10:37-38). Today’s equivalent of the storehouse would be the church, which then uses the tithe to support its pastors. By the way, Malachi makes it clear that the tithe is to be used solely for the work of ministry, nothing else. Some may also wonder whether tithing comes out of pre- or post-tax income, but the truth is that it’s not possible to actually outgive God (Luke 6:38), so if the government gets a cut from our gross then certainly our heavenly Father deserves better than what is left after tax. Did Jesus say anything about tithing? “Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye pay tithe of mint and anise and cummin, and have omitted the weightier matters of the law, judgment, mercy, and faith: these ought ye to have done, and not to leave the other undone.” —Matthew 23:23 Here Jesus pointed out that it is possible to do the right thing and still have an uncoverted heart. The Pharisees were careful to observe religious principles, but they did not experience the converting power of the Holy Spirit upon the heart. This conversion is what Jesus referred to when He told Nicodemus that one cannot enter the kingdom of God without being born again (John 3:3-5), but once it takes place, the fruits of the Spirit are then evident in the life (Galatians 5:22-25). This is why Jesus rebuked the Pharisees for failing to show justice, mercy, and grace, but notice that He did commend their practice of returning tithe. Is tithing only for the Jewish people? “And Melchizedek king of Salem brought forth bread and wine: and he was the priest of the most high God. And he blessed him, and said, Blessed be Abram of the most high God, possessor of heaven and earth, and blessed be the most high God, which hath delivered thine enemies into thy hand. And he gave him tithes of all.” —Genesis 14:20 “And this stone, which I have set for a pillar, shall be God’s house: and of all that thou shalt give me I will surely give the tenth unto thee.” —Genesis 28:22 Genesis tells us that tithing was practiced by Abram and Jacob before the existance of the Israelite nation, which means that God gives everyone the privilege to honor Him by returning a tenth of His blessings. This also means that tithing was not abolished at the cross because it was never limited to the laws and ordinances of Moses. Can I chose where my tithe goes? “And all the tithe of the land, whether of the seed of the land, or of the fruit of the tree, is the LORD’S: it is holy unto the LORD.” —Leviticus 27:30 God has claimed the tithe as His own, reserving it for the work of ministry (Malachi 3:10), and He has called it holy, so the decision to use it for another purpose, such as charitable giving, is not for us to make. How should I support other worthy causes? “Give unto the LORD the glory due unto his name: bring an offering, and come into his courts.” —Psalm 96:8 “Every man according as he purposeth in his heart, so let him give; not grudgingly, or of necessity: for God loveth a cheerful giver.” —2 Corinthians 9:7 “Every man shall give as he is able, according to the blessing of the LORD thy God which he hath given thee.” —Deuteronomy 16:17 The Bible does make provision for the use of voluntary offerings for other worthy causes, which are given according to the discretion of the giver; however, it’s important to note that God does not want us to give grudgingly, but only if it comes from a cheerful, willing heart. How important is faithfulness in returning tithe? “Will a man rob God? Yet ye have robbed me. But ye say, Wherein have we robbed thee? In tithes and offerings. Ye are cursed with a curse: for ye have robbed me, even this whole nation. Bring ye all the tithes into the storehouse, that there may be meat in mine house, and prove me now herewith, saith the LORD of hosts, if I will not open you the windows of heaven, and pour you out a blessing, that there shall not be room enough to receive it. And I will rebuke the devourer for your sakes, and he shall not destroy the fruits of your ground; neither shall your vine cast her fruit before the time in the field, saith the LORD of hosts.” —Malachi 3:8-11 Because the tithe belongs to the Lord, the Bible says that neglecting to return it is robbery of God, which is a violation of the eight commandment (Exodus 20:15): “Thou shalt not steal.” Ultimately, it’s not our money that God is after, but our heart, and a willingness to obey Him, out of love, in all things, is evidence of a heart that is surrendered. Moreover, Malachi teaches that it’s not really possible to outgive God because His generosity exceeds our ability to receive (Malachi 3:10), and it’s this generosity that He wants to develop in our own lives. He wants us to share in the blessing of giving—to realize that “it is more blessed to give than to receive” (Acts 20:35). Ultimately, though, His greatest desire is for us to enter into a trusting relationship with Him. It’s also important to note that the promise of God’s blessing on those who faithfully tithe does not guarantee protection from hardship because we still live in a world of sin, nor does it guarantee financial prosperity because God is the one who chooses the type of blessing. While He can and does bless His people financially, there are other forms of blessing too, such as good health, peace of mind, protection, wisdom, good family relations, solid friendships, old things lasting longer, and others. The Bible says the poor will always be with us (John 12:8), so just as financial prosperity is not necessarily a sign of God’s blessing, a lack of it is not a sign of His disapproval. We can rest assured that our heavenly Father is acquainted with all of our needs, and He will give us the right blessing at the right time (1 Peter 5:7). How can I be sure I’m tithing for the right reason? “If ye love me, keep my commandments.” —John 14:15 “But God be thanked, that ye were the servants of sin, but ye have obeyed from the heart that form of doctrine which was delivered you.” —Romans 6:17 Obedience with tithing, as with the Ten Commandments, is not a form righteousness by works because the Bible is clear that we are saved by faith only (Ephesians 2:8-9). We obey not to be saved but because we are saved by the grace and mercy of God that is freely available to all. When His love for us awakens a love for Him then it is only natural to want to please the person we genuinely love. Of course, this desire and ability to obey God comes only through the work of the Holy Spirit upon the heart, which Paul so eloquently explains in Romans 8:4-9. Such obedience can only be righteousness by faith because it is not our own, but it is evidence that love for God reigns supreme in the heart. Could the tithing system be abused? “Then saith one of his disciples, Judas Iscariot, Simon’s son, which should betray him, Why was not this ointment sold for three hundred pence, and given to the poor? This he said, not that he cared for the poor; but because he was a thief, and had the bag, and bare what was put therein.” —John 12:4-6 Where there are people there will be room for dishonesty, but human weakness is not an excuse for us not to be faithful to God. After all, Judas, one of Christ’s own disciples, was a thief. Remember, Christ commended the poor widow who gave all that she had to a church whose leaders would later crucify Him (Mark 12:41-44), but He still honored her because she gave out of love and faithfulness to Him (Hebrews 7:8). Our part is to be faithful to God, but once the money leaves our hands, it becomes His responsibility to deal with any potential misuse of His funds. What promises does God give us? “There is that scattereth, and yet increaseth; and there is that withholdeth more than is meet, but it tendeth to poverty. The liberal soul shall be made fat: and he that watereth shall be watered also himself.” —Proverbs 11:24,25 “Honour the LORD with thy substance, and with the firstfruits of all thine increase: so shall thy barns be filled with plenty, and thy presses shall burst out with new wine.” —Proverbs 3:9,10 What advice does Jesus give regarding life priorities? “Lay not up for yourselves treasures upon earth, where moth and rust doth corrupt, and where thieves break through and steal: but lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust doth corrupt, and where thieves do not break through nor steal: for where your treasure is, there will your heart be also.” —Matthew 6:19-21 “But seek ye first the kingdom of God, and his righteousness; and all these things shall be added unto you.” —Matthew 6:33 “If ye know these things, happy are ye if ye do them.” —John 13:17 Jesus invites us to store treasure in heaven, not on earth, because our hearts are tightly linked with our investments. The heart focused on accumulating more and more money becomes greedy and covetous, but if the focus is on sharing the good news of Jesus then it becomes generous, loving, and joyful. Many people make the things of the world their first priority, and they still worry about their future, but Jesus asks His followers to do the opposite—to seek first His kingdom and His righteousness, and the promise is He will take care of everything else. So let’s trust Him fully and seek His will in everything we do (Proverbs 3:5-6), including how we use our time and talents, because, in the end, His ways are always higher than our own (Isaiah 55:8-9).",

      "title": "Origin of Evil",
      "series": "The Great Controversy",
      "body": "Is God evil? “He that loveth not knoweth not God; for God is love.” —1 John 4:8 “For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.” —John 3:16 How did evil originate? “Another parable put he forth unto them, saying, The kingdom of heaven is likened unto a man which sowed good seed in his field: But while men slept, his enemy came and sowed tares among the wheat, and went his way. But when the blade was sprung up, and brought forth fruit, then appeared the tares also. So the servants of the householder came and said unto him, Sir, didst not thou sow good seed in thy field? from whence then hath it tares? He said unto them, An enemy hath done this.” —Matthew 13:24-28 God cannot be the originator of evil because that is contrary to His character of love. It was an enemy of God that was responsible for the birth of evil. What was Satan’s original name? “How art thou fallen from heaven, O Lucifer, son of the morning! how art thou cut down to the ground, which didst weaken the nations!” —Isaiah 14:12 Lucifer means “light bearer”, and he was one of God’s angels. Was Lucifer perfect when God created him? “Thou sealest up the sum, full of wisdom, and perfect in beauty. Thou hast been in Eden the garden of God; every precious stone was thy covering, the sardius, topaz, and the diamond, the beryl, the onyx, and the jasper, the sapphire, the emerald, and the carbuncle, and gold: the workmanship of thy tabrets and of thy pipes was prepared in thee in the day that thou wast created. Thou art the anointed cherub that covereth; and I have set thee so: thou wast upon the holy mountain of God; thou hast walked up and down in the midst of the stones of fire. Thou wast perfect in thy ways from the day that thou wast created, till iniquity was found in thee.” —Ezekiel 28:12-15 “The Lord reigneth; let the people tremble: he sitteth between the cherubims; let the earth be moved.” —Psalm 99:1 In Ezekiel 28 Lucifer is symbolized as the “prince of Tyre,” and we learn that he was created perfect. He was also a covering cherub, which means he had a high position in heaven and was next to God’s very presence. It’s unknown how long perfection existed in heaven, but eventually evil was born in Lucifer’s heart because he aall of God’s angels had freedom of choice. This is a risk God willingly took because genuine love cannot exist without a free will. How did he taint his heart? “By the multitude of thy merchandise they have filled the midst of thee with violence, and thou hast sinned: therefore I will cast thee as profane out of the mountain of God: and I will destroy thee, O covering cherub, from the midst of the stones of fire. Thine heart was lifted up because of thy beauty, thou hast corrupted thy wisdom by reason of thy brightness: I will cast thee to the ground, I will lay thee before kings, that they may behold thee.” —Ezekiel 28:16-17 “How art thou fallen from heaven, O Lucifer, son of the morning! how art thou cut down to the ground, which didst weaken the nations! For thou hast said in thine heart, I will ascend into heaven, I will exalt my throne above the stars of God: I will sit also upon the mount of the congregation, in the sides of the north: I will ascend above the heights of the clouds; I will be like the most High.” —Isaiah 14:12-14 Lucifer allowed his beauty to fill him with pride, and he started to envy God’s power, His throne, and the worship of the angels. Eventually, his goal was to unseat God. What did this lead to? “And there was war in heaven: Michael and his angels fought against the dragon; and the dragon fought and his angels, and prevailed not; neither was their place found any more in heaven.” —Revelation 12:7-8 “And he [Jesus] said unto them, I beheld Satan as lightning fall from heaven.” —Luke 10:18 Lucifer was able to convince other angels to join him in his rebellion, leading to war in heaven. God could have then destroyed him, but He did not want the remaining angels to worship Him out of fear, so He cast Lucifer out of heaven and gave him an opportunity to demonstrate what would be the result of sin and rebellion. Would it bring more prosperity and happiness than God’s form of government? Where did he end up? “And the great dragon was cast out, that old serpent, called the Devil, and Satan, which deceiveth the whole world: he was cast out into the earth, and his angels were cast out with him.” —Revelation 12:9 Earth is where Satan would have a chance to develop his own form of government. What did God do next? “So God created man in his own image, in the image of God created he him; male and female created he them. And God blessed them, and God said unto them, Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it: and have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth. ““And God said, Behold, I have given you every herb bearing seed, which is upon the face of all the earth, and every tree, in the which is the fruit of a tree yielding seed; to you it shall be for meat. And to every beast of the earth, and to every fowl of the air, and to every thing that creepeth upon the earth, wherein there is life, I have given every green herb for meat: and it was so. And God saw every thing that he had made, and, behold, it was very good. And the evening and the morning were the sixth day.” —Genesis 1:27-31 “And the LORD God took the man, and put him into the garden of Eden to dress it and to keep it. And the LORD God commanded the man, saying, Of every tree of the garden thou mayest freely eat: But of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not eat of it: for in the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die.” —Genesis 2:15-17 After losing some of His angels, God created a new order of beings after His own image. Adam and Eve were to be independent judges between the government of God and that of Satan since they did not witness the conflict in heaven. God gave them a perfect start, everything they needed for happiness and prosperity, but like His angels, they also had free will, and in order to be fair to Satan, God gave him access to them at the tree. What lie did Satan tell Eve that was an echo of Isaiah 14:14? “Now the serpent was more subtil than any beast of the field which the LORD God had made. And he said unto the woman, Yea, hath God said, Ye shall not eat of every tree of the garden? And the woman said unto the serpent, We may eat of the fruit of the trees of the garden: But of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden, God hath said, Ye shall not eat of it, neither shall ye touch it, lest ye die. And the serpent said unto the woman, Ye shall not surely die: For God doth know that in the day ye eat thereof, then your eyes shall be opened, and ye shall be as gods, knowing good and evil.” —Genesis 3:1-5 Satan used a serpent to deceive Eve and contradict God by telling her that not only would she not die if she ate the fruit, but she would also become like God, which is exactly what Satan himself desired in heaven. The implication was that God was holding her back from reaching her fullest potential, and Satan was actually the one who had her best interests in mind, not God. What happened instead? “And when the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that it was pleasant to the eyes, and a tree to be desired to make one wise, she took of the fruit thereof, and did eat, and gave also unto her husband with her; and he did eat. And the eyes of them both were opened, and they knew that they were naked; and they sewed fig leaves together, and made themselves aprons.” —Genesis 3:6-7 In order to deceive Eve, Satan mixed in some truth with his lie when he said she would know good and evil because now that they had sinned against God, Adam and Eve lost their innocence, and their eyes were indeed opened to shame, grief, suffering, pain, and death, but they did not ascend to a higher state of existence, as Satan had promised. It was not God’s will for them to know evil, but because Adam and Eve had chosen to believe Satan’s version of reality, he was now free to proceed with establishing his form of government on Earth. What does sin do? “And they heard the voice of the LORD God walking in the garden in the cool of the day: and Adam and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the LORD God amongst the trees of the garden.” —Genesis 3:8 “Behold, the LORD’S hand is not shortened, that it cannot save; neither his ear heavy, that it cannot hear: But your iniquities have separated between you and your God, and your sins have hid his face from you, that he will not hear.” —Isaiah 59:1-2 As soon as Adam and Eve sinned, they hid from God for the first time. Sin leads to separation from God because sin cannot exist in the presence of a holy God without being consumed by it. A chasm was now formed between the Giver of life and His creation, and the process of death had commenced. What did sin do to the human heart? “The heart is deceitful above all things, and desperately wicked; who can know it?” —Jeremiah 17:9 Once the human heart was corrupted with sin, the door was opened up to the influence of evil in all it’s forms. What does sin lead to? “For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.” —Romans 6:23 Sin leads to separation from the Giver of life, which leads to death. How many are subject to death? “Wherefore, as by one man sin entered into the world, and death by sin; and so death passed upon all men, for that all have sinned.” —Romans 5:12 “For all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God.” —Romans 3:23 Am I really free in my fallen condition? “Know ye not, that to whom ye yield yourselves servants to obey, his servants ye are to whom ye obey; whether of sin unto death, or of obedience unto righteousness?” —Romans 6:16 Ever since the fall, the human race no longer has true freedom and has become a slave to sin and, ultimately, to death. Is there hope of escaping death? “And I will put enmity between you and the woman, and between your seed and her Seed; He shall bruise your head, and you shall bruise His heel.” —Genesis 3:15, NKJV “Forasmuch then as the children are partakers of flesh and blood, he also himself likewise took part of the same; that through death he might destroy him that had the power of death, that is, the devil; And deliver them who through fear of death were all their lifetime subject to bondage. For verily he took not on him the nature of angels; but he took on him the seed of Abraham.Wherefore in all things it behoved him to be made like unto his brethren, that he might be a merciful and faithful high priest in things pertaining to God, to make reconciliation for the sins of the people.” —Hebrews 2:14-17 Once Adam and Eve fell, God did not leave them in their hopeless condition but gave them a promise that sin would not reign on earth forever. A Redeemer would come who would crush the head of Satan and break the power of sin and death over the human race by paying for their sins Himself. How can I escape death? “For if by one man’s offence death reigned by one; much more they which receive abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness shall reign in life by one, Jesus Christ. Therefore as by the offence of one judgment came upon all men to condemnation; even so by the righteousness of one the free gift came upon all men unto justification of life. For as by one man’s disobedience many were made sinners, so by the obedience of one shall many be made righteous.” —Romans 5:17-19 “Being justified freely by his grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus: Whom God hath set forth to be a propitiation through faith in his blood, to declare his righteousness for the remission of sins that are past, through the forbearance of God.” —Romans 3:24-25 Christ’s perfect life gives us the ability to be free from the bondage of sin and it’s penalty of death! By paying for our sins, Jesus made it possible for anyone who receives this free gift by faith through repentance of sins to be forgiven and declared righteous before God! What does God promise? “For I the LORD thy God will hold thy right hand, saying unto thee, Fear not; I will help thee.” —Isaiah 41:13 God in His love and mercy does not leave us in our hopeless condition. He gave His own Son to give us a way out of our predicament and eliminate the separation that occured between Him and the human race in the Garden of Eden. Will Satan live forever? “Thine heart was lifted up because of thy beauty, thou hast corrupted thy wisdom by reason of thy brightness: I will cast thee to the ground, I will lay thee before kings, that they may behold thee. Thou hast defiled thy sanctuaries by the multitude of thine iniquities, by the iniquity of thy traffick; therefore will I bring forth a fire from the midst of thee, it shall devour thee, and I will bring thee to ashes upon the earth in the sight of all them that behold thee.” —Ezekiel 28:17-18 What will God do once evil is eradicated? “And I saw a new heaven and a new earth: for the first heaven and the first earth were passed away; and there was no more sea. And I John saw the holy city, new Jerusalem, coming down from God out of heaven, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband. And I heard a great voice out of heaven saying, Behold, the tabernacle of God is with men, and he will dwell with them, and they shall be his people, and God himself shall be with them, and be their God. And God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes; and there shall be no more death, neither sorrow, nor crying, neither shall there be any more pain: for the former things are passed away. And he that sat upon the throne said, Behold, I make all things new. And he said unto me, Write: for these words are true and faithful.” —Revelation 21:1-5 There will come a day when Satan will be destroyed and his flawed kingdom will come to an end. It will be replaced by an earth that will be even more glorious than the Garden of Eden, and we will once again be able to talk to God face to face! Will evil rise again? “What do ye imagine against the LORD? he will make an utter end: affliction shall not rise up the second time.” —Nahum 1:9 “And one shall say unto him, What are these wounds in thine hands? Then He shall answer, Those with which I was wounded in the house of my friends.” —Zechariah 13:6 Sin and rebellion will never rise up again because the pierced hands of Jesus will be an eternal reminder of the evil results of sin.",

      "body": "What is faith? “Now faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen.” —Hebrews 11:1 Faith is what reaches out and grasps things not seen that are backed up by evidence. In Isaiah 1:18 God says, “Come now, and let us reason together,” which means He does not want anyone to blindly follow Him; on the contrary, He wants faith to be informed by evidence. Why is faith necessary? “But without faith it is impossible to please him: for he that cometh to God must believe that he is, and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him.” —Hebrews 11:6 Faith is the means by which my journey with Jesus starts. It is the hand of faith that reaches out to grasp the outstretched hand of God. He is always ready and eager to help those who come to Him, but I must first believe in Him and His goodness. This faith is based on plentiful evidence, but the evidence does not remove the need for faith altogether. There will always be room for doubt for those who want to doubt simply because the finite human mind cannot fully grasp an everlasting, infinite God. Thus the need for faith: God said it—I believe it. How many have faith? “For I say, through the grace given unto me, to every man that is among you, not to think of himself more highly than he ought to think; but to think soberly, according as God hath dealt to every man the measure of faith.” —Romans 12:3 Fatih is like a muscle; every person has been given a measure of it. Some neglect it, never use it, and it grows weak. Others act on what they have, reaching out to God, and He meets them where they are, revealing Himself to them, which in turn makes their faith stronger, and then they act on that, and it continues to grow each time it is used. What if my faith is weak? “And the apostles said unto the Lord, Increase our faith.” —Luke 17:5 “Jesus said unto him, If thou canst believe, all things are possible to him that believeth. And straightway the father of the child cried out, and said with tears, Lord, I believe; help thou mine unbelief.” —Mark 9:23-24 “Then came the disciples to Jesus apart, and said, Why could not we cast him out? And Jesus said unto them, Because of your unbelief: for verily I say unto you, If ye have faith as a grain of mustard seed, ye shall say unto this mountain, Remove hence to yonder place; and it shall remove; and nothing shall be impossible unto you.” —Matthew 17:19-20 Even if my faith is weak and small as a tiny seed, I can exercise the faith that I do have, and ask God to increase it, believing in His power to do so, and it will be done. What is faith based on? “So then faith cometh by hearing, and hearing by the word of God.” —Romans 10:17 “Another parable put he forth unto them, saying, The kingdom of heaven is like to a grain of mustard seed, which a man took, and sowed in his field: which indeed is the least of all seeds: but when it is grown, it is the greatest among herbs, and becometh a tree, so that the birds of the air come and lodge in the branches thereof.” —Matthew 13:31-32 Faith is primarily based on the evidence of truth revealed in the Word of God, the Bible. Like a seed that is watered by the rain, faith grows whenever it is watered with the truth of His Word and that truth is then internalized—received and allowed to take root in the heart. With our cooperation, God can take that small seed of faith and make it grow into a mature tree through His Word. What role does faith have in prayer? “And Jesus answering saith unto them, Have faith in God. For verily I say unto you, That whosoever shall say unto this mountain, Be thou removed, and be thou cast into the sea; and shall not doubt in his heart, but shall believe that those things which he saith shall come to pass; he shall have whatsoever he saith. Therefore I say unto you, What things soever ye desire, when ye pray, believe that ye receive them, and ye shall have them.” —Mark 11:22-24 “And when he was come into the house, the blind men came to him: and Jesus saith unto them, Believe ye that I am able to do this? They said unto him, Yea, Lord. Then touched he their eyes, saying, According to your faith be it unto you. And their eyes were opened.” —Matthew 9:28-30 “And this is the confidence that we have in him, that, if we ask any thing according to his will, he heareth us.” —1 John 5:14 “But let him ask in faith, with no doubting, for he who doubts is like a wave of the sea driven and tossed by the wind.” —James 1:6, NKJV My prayers are answered according to my faith, or confidence, in Jesus’ power and love, which I become aware of by exposing my mind and heart to His Word. The Bible says that I can be confident that any request that is in harmony with God’s will, as revealed in His Word, He hears. What is the power of the gospel dependent on? “For unto us was the gospel preached, as well as unto them: but the word preached did not profit them, not being mixed with faith in them that heard it.” —Hebrews 4:2 The gospel is the good news of God’s desire and power to save humanity from the misery of sin. When the gospel is mingled with faith, it is acted on and received into the mind and heart, starting a marvelous process of transformation in the life of the receiver through the power of God. How do I inherit the promises of God? “That ye be not slothful, but followers of them who through faith and patience inherit the promises.” —Hebrews 6:12 “These all died in faith, not having received the promises, but having seen them afar off, and were persuaded of them, and embraced them, and confessed that they were strangers and pilgrims on the earth. For they that say such things declare plainly that they seek a country. And truly, if they had been mindful of that country from whence they came out, they might have had opportunity to have returned. But now they desire a better country, that is, an heavenly: wherefore God is not ashamed to be called their God: for he hath prepared for them a city.” —Hebrews 11:13-16 How is faith linked with forgiveness? “And when he saw their faith, he said unto him, Man, thy sins are forgiven thee.” —Luke 5:20 The Bible shows God is willing to forgive anyone who is truly repentant. When this evidence is acted on by faith, when I take God at His Word, He will forgive me too, just like He forgave the paralytic according to his faith. How important is faith in salvation? “For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God: not of works, lest any man should boast.” —Ephesians 2:8-9 Salvation is only through faith. I am made righteous by faith in Jesus’ love as expressed in His willingness to forgive my sins and clothe me with His righteousness. I am also sanctified by faith in His power to save me from my sins. Salvation is completely of God; it is a gift. Faith is the means by which I reach out to Him and recieve that gift. Whose faith came to my rescue? “I am crucified with Christ: nevertheless I live; yet not I, but Christ liveth in me: and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God, who loved me, and gave himself for me.” —Galatians 2:20 I am alive because of the perfect faith of Jesus, who opened the way of salvation for me. What is evident in those who are saved by faith? “By whom [Jesus] we have received grace and apostleship, for obedience to the faith among all nations, for his name.” —Romans 1:5 “Here is the patience of the saints: here are they that keep the commandments of God, and the faith of Jesus.” —Revelation 14:12 Those who have the faith of Jesus also keep the commandments of God because Jesus Himself kept them. In the book of Romans Paul says Jesus gives us grace for obedience to the faith. Now it is true that I am saved by faith alone, but it is also true that once I am saved by Jesus, my love for Him leads me to obey Him. Obedience is the result of salvation, not the means to it. It can only be born out of love for the One who died for me, and it is made possible by His grace working in me. Is there more evidence of this? “Even so faith, if it hath not works, is dead, being alone. Yea, a man may say, Thou hast faith, and I have works: shew me thy faith without thy works, and I will shew thee my faith by my works. Thou believest that there is one God; thou doest well: the devils also believe, and tremble. But wilt thou know, O vain man, that faith without works is dead?” —James 2:17-20 “Do men gather grapes of thorns, or figs of thistles? Even so every good tree bringeth forth good fruit; but a corrupt tree bringeth forth evil fruit. … Wherefore by their fruits ye shall know them. Not every one that saith unto me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of heaven; but he that doeth the will of my Father which is in heaven. Many will say to me in that day, Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied in thy name? and in thy name have cast out devils? and in thy name done many wonderful works? And then will I profess unto them, I never knew you: depart from me, ye that work iniquity.” —Matthew 7:16-17, 20-23 Obedience shows the genuineness of my faith. Put another way, my faith is confirmed, or justified, to me by my works. They are evidence for me, not God, since He already knows my genuine heart (Psalm 139:1-4), but I do need the evidence because it’s easy to deceive myself about my true condition (Jeremiah 17:9-10). What is the counterfeit to faith? “Then the devil taketh him up into the holy city, and setteth him on a pinnacle of the temple, and saith unto him, If thou be the Son of God, cast thyself down: for it is written, He shall give his angels charge concerning thee: and in their hands they shall bear thee up, lest at any time thou dash thy foot against a stone. Jesus said unto him, It is written again, Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God.” —Matthew 4:5-7 “Behold, I give unto you power to tread on serpents and scorpions, and over all the power of the enemy: and nothing shall by any means hurt you.” —Luke 10:19 The counterfeit of faith is presumption, which tends to put God to the test under contrived and unnatural circumstances, often for selfish motives. Satan tempted Jesus to cast Himself down to prove His divinity by perverting a promise from Psalm 91:12, but this promise wasn not made for deliberate, voluntary, self-created dangers. Even though Jesus gave His disciples power over serpents and scorpions, they were not supposed to go looking for them intentionally to prove their faith. How do I overcome? “For whatsoever is born of God overcometh the world: and this is the victory that overcometh the world, even our faith.” —1 John 5:4 Those who have faith in God’s power not only to forgive their sins, but also to save them from their sins will be victorious!",

He retaineth not his anger for ever, because he delighteth in mercy. He will turn again, he will have compassion upon us; he will subdue our iniquities; and thou wilt cast all their sins into the depths of the sea.” —Micah 7:18-19 “For I will be merciful to their unrighteousness, and their sins and their iniquities will I remember no more.” —Hebrews 8:12 Did God forsake Israel in their rebellion? “And refused to obey, neither were mindful of thy wonders that thou didst among them; but hardened their necks, and in their rebellion appointed a captain to return to their bondage: but thou art a God ready to pardon, gracious and merciful, slow to anger, and of great kindness, and forsookest them not.” —Nehemiah 9:17 How can I receive forgiveness of my sins? “Repent ye therefore, and be converted, that your sins may be blotted out, when the times of refreshing shall come from the presence of the Lord.” —Acts 3:19 “Let the wicked forsake his way, and the unrighteous man his thoughts: and let him return unto the LORD, and he will have mercy upon him; and to our God, for he will abundantly pardon.” —Isaiah 55:7 Forsaking my way implies turning around and going in the opposite direction. I go from running away from God toward sin to running away from sin toward God. If I repent and have a desire to leave my sins behind, the promise is I will receive forgiveness. How many sins is God willing to cleanse me from? “If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.” —1 John 1:9 God will never refuse to forgive a person who is truly sorry and genuinely asks Him for forgiveness. How does God want me to live after I’ve been forgiven? “When Jesus had lifted up himself, and saw none but the woman, he said unto her, Woman, where are those thine accusers? hath no man condemned thee? She said, No man, Lord. And Jesus said unto her, Neither do I condemn thee: go, and sin no more.” —John 8:10-11 Jesus doesn’t just want to forgive my sins; He wants to cleanse me from my sins and restore His image in me by transforming my life. How can He give me victory over all of my sins? “Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and ye shall find; knock, and it shall be opened unto you: for every one that asketh receiveth; and he that seeketh findeth; and to him that knocketh it shall be opened.” —Matthew 7:7-8 “And this is the confidence that we have in him, that, if we ask any thing according to his will, he heareth us.” —1 John 5:14 “What shall we then say to these things? If God be for us, who can be against us? He that spared not His own Son, but delivered Him up for us all, how shall He not with Him also freely give us all things?” —Romans 8:31-32 There is no sin too powerful for God, but He cannot do anything against my will either. If I confess my sins and ask Him to give me victory over them, believing that He is powerful enough to do it, He will do it according to my faith. What promise does He give me? “Then will I sprinkle clean water upon you, and ye shall be clean: from all your filthiness, and from all your idols, will I cleanse you. A new heart also will I give you, and a new spirit will I put within you: and I will take away the stony heart out of your flesh, and I will give you an heart of flesh. And I will put my spirit within you, and cause you to walk in my statutes, and ye shall keep my judgments, and do them.” —Ezekiel 36:25-27 “He will turn again, he will have compassion upon us; he will subdue our iniquities; and thou wilt cast all their sins into the depths of the sea.” —Micah 7:19 God wants to free me from the power of sin because sin hurts me. He can also give me the power to be free because I cannot change myself, just like a leopard cannot change his spots, but He can! He promises to give a new heart and a new spirit to those who ask Him. Why can I receive forgiveness? “I have blotted out, as a thick cloud, thy transgressions, and, as a cloud, thy sins: return unto me; for I have redeemed thee.” —Isaiah 44:22 Who ended up paying for my sins? “Who hath delivered us from the power of darkness, and hath translated us into the kingdom of his dear Son: in whom we have redemption through his blood, even the forgiveness of sins.” —Colossians 1:13-14 I can be forgiven because Christ already paid for my sins on the cross and redeemed me from them. All I have to do is ask. Will He remember my sins once I ask for forgiveness? “I, even I, am he that blotteth out thy transgressions for mine own sake, and will not remember thy sins.” —Isaiah 43:25 What does the Bible say about those who’ve been forgiven? “Blessed is he whose transgression is forgiven, whose sin is covered.” —Psalm 32:1 Could receiving forgiveness affect my health? “Bless the LORD, O my soul, and forget not all his benefits: who forgiveth all thine iniquities; who healeth all thy diseases; who redeemeth thy life from destruction; who crowneth thee with lovingkindness and tender mercies; who satisfieth thy mouth with good things; so that thy youth is renewed like the eagle’s.” —Psalm 103:2-5 Carrying feelings of guilt is not good for my health, but knowing I’ve been forgiven can bring both physical and mental healing. But what if I’m guilty of many sins? “This is a faithful saying, and worthy of all acceptation, that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners; of whom I am chief.” —1 Timothy 1:15 “Wherefore I say unto thee, her sins, which are many, are forgiven, for she loved much: but to whom little is forgiven, the same loveth little.” —Luke 7:47 Every sin which I genuinely repent of and confess to Christ wil be forgiven. Does God want me to forgive others once He has forgiven me? “And be ye kind one to another, tenderhearted, forgiving one another, even as God for Christ’s sake hath forgiven you.” —Ephesians 4:32 “Now instead, you ought to forgive and comfort him, so that he will not be overwhelmed by excessive sorrow. I urge you, therefore, to reaffirm your love for him. Another reason I wrote you was to see if you would stand the test and be obedient in everything.” —2 Corinthians 2:7-9, NIV Forgiving others and giving the matter over to Jesus also lightens my own burden.",

      "body": "Is God triune? “For there are three that bear record in heaven, the Father, the Word, and the Holy Ghost: and these three are one.” —1 John 5:7 “Go ye therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost.” —Matthew 28:19 “How much more shall the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered himself without spot to God, purge your conscience from dead works to serve the living God?” —Hebrews 9:14 The Godhead consists of three distinct persons: God the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy Spirit. Though distinct, they are one in nature, character, purpose, and will. In this article, when I use the term God, I am referring specifically to the Father, because Scripture presents Him as holding the highest authority within the Godhead (John 14:28), though the term is equally appropriate for the Son and the Holy Spirit. The Father’s position of highest authority indicates a hierarchy within the Godhead. For example, the Father sent the Son (John 17:3), and both the Father and the Son send the Holy Spirit (John 14:26; 15:26), yet the Holy Spirit does not send the Father or the Son. This order reflects voluntary, loving submission, not inequality, for the Son and the Holy Spirit are not coerced, nor is their divinity diminished in any way. All three are fully and equally God. A similar hierarchy exists among the angels and within both the church and the family, with Christ as the head of the church and the husband as the head of the household (Ephesians 5:23). Does God have a beginning or end? “Before the mountains were brought forth, or ever thou hadst formed the earth and the world, even from everlasting to everlasting, thou art God.” —Psalm 90:2 “I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the ending, saith the LORD, which is, and which was, and which is to come, the Almighty.” —Revelation 1:8 It may be hard for our finite minds to comprehend—especially since none of us are exempt from death—but God is infinite; He always has been and always will be. What belongs to God? “The earth is the LORD’S, and the fulness thereof; the world, and they that dwell therein.” —Psalm 24:1 “What? know ye not that your body is the temple of the Holy Ghost which is in you, which ye have of God, and ye are not your own? For ye are bought with a price: therefore glorify God in your body, and in your spirit, which are God’s.” —1 Corinthians 6:19-20 “But now thus saith the LORD that created thee, O Jacob, and he that formed thee, O Israel, Fear not: for I have redeemed thee, I have called thee by thy name; thou art mine. When thou passest through the waters, I will be with thee; and through the rivers, they shall not overflow thee: when thou walkest through the fire, thou shalt not be burned; neither shall the flame kindle upon thee. For I am the LORD thy God, the Holy One of Israel, thy Saviour.” —Isaiah 43:1-3 Everything belongs to God first and foremost by creation, for nothing created itself. Humans belong to God both by creation and by redemption, for Jesus paid the price for our sin, thereby redeeming us from the power of death. In other words, we are doubly His: first because He gave us life, and second because He rescued us from certain death. Because He created us, He cares for us as a loving Father cares for His children. It may be astonishing—or even difficult to grasp—that the Creator and King of the universe cares for each of us personally, but it is absolutely true. When we feel abandoned or neglected, He sees us and is with us (Isaiah 40:27-31; 41:10). He keeps our hearts beating, provides for our needs, and has a solution for every crisis (Acts 17:28; Matthew 6:26; 10:29-31; 2 Chronicles 16:9). No matter the time or place, He is always only a prayer away (Jeremiah 29:11-13). Is God omnipotent? “And all the inhabitants of the earth are reputed as nothing: and he doeth according to his will in the army of heaven, and among the inhabitants of the earth: and none can stay his hand, or say unto him, What doest thou?” —Daniel 4:35 “And he changeth the times and the seasons: he removeth kings, and setteth up kings: he giveth wisdom unto the wise, and knowledge to them that know understanding.” —Daniel 2:21 “Ah Lord GOD! behold, thou hast made the heaven and the earth by thy great power and stretched out arm, and there is nothing too hard for thee.” —Jeremiah 32:17 “I know that, whatsoever God doeth, it shall be for ever: nothing can be put to it, nor any thing taken from it: and God doeth it, that men should fear before him.” —Ecclesiastes 3:14 God is omnipotent, yet He is not a tyrant; on the contrary, He sacrifices Himself for His creation. He carries out His will through His Word, which possesses creative power to accomplish what He declares (Numbers 23:19; Isaiah 55:11). His desire for Adam and Eve was that their descendants would inherit the earth as an everlasting possession (Genesis 17:8; 48:4), and although this has been delayed because of sin and death, it will ultimately be fulfilled (Psalm 37:11; Matthew 5:5; Revelation 7:9-10)—at immeasurable cost to Himself—for His Word cannot fail. Remarkably, God brings His purposes to completion without violating anyone’s free will: all who desire to become His sons and daughters will inherit the land first given to Adam and Eve, reaffirmed to Abraham, and secured in Christ (Genesis 1:26-28; 15:5-7; Galatians 3:16, 29; John 1:12-13). Does He make mistakes? “As for God, his way is perfect: the word of the LORD is tried: he is a buckler to all those that trust in him.” —Psalm 18:30 “He is the Rock, his work is perfect: for all his ways are judgment: a God of truth and without iniquity, just and right is he.” —Deuteronomy 32:4 “The LORD is righteous in all his ways, and holy in all his works.” —Psalm 145:17 Because God does not make mistakes, every human He created—from the moment of conception—matters, has a purpose, and is cherished (Isaiah 49:1; Jeremiah 1:5). Despite the widespread acceptance of Darwin’s ill-conceived “survival of the fittest” theory, there is no such thing as an expendable or inferior person—much less a group of people. This truth has profound implications for how we treat others as a society and as individuals—from those closest to us, to our enemies, to the unborn, to the homeless. Justice and law must always be respected, but even criminals deserve to be treated with human dignity. On a personal level, no matter how negatively we may feel about ourselves or the direction our life has taken, God is in the work of bringing healing, restoration, and freedom where there is brokenness, despair, and bondage (Psalm 147:3; Joel 2:25-26; Isaiah 43:18-19; 61:1-3; Ezekiel 37:4-6). The more hopeless the case, the stronger His desire to help. Can we fully comprehend Him? “Canst thou by searching find out God? canst thou find out the Almighty unto perfection? It is as high as heaven; what canst thou do? deeper than hell; what canst thou know? The measure thereof is longer than the earth, and broader than the sea.” —Job 11:7-9 “Have you not known? Have you not heard? The everlasting God, the LORD, The Creator of the ends of the earth, Neither faints nor is weary. His understanding is unsearchable.” —Isaiah 40:28 “Now faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen.” —Hebrews 11:1 A finite human mind cannot comprehend the infinite God. At the same time, He has not left us to walk in blind ignorance but has revealed everything we need to know about Him—first and foremost in His Word. Yet that is not all, for we can also learn about Him through the things He has made. The starry skies, the breathtaking landscapes, and the plant and animal kingdoms all give us glimpses of their Maker. We are saved by faith, but He does not expect us to operate on blind faith, for He has given us abundant evidence on which to base our belief. In fact, it often takes more faith to accept human theories than to trust the biblical record. Even so, the need for faith is never removed entirely, for those who wish to doubt will always find room to do so. After all, apart from the thirty-three years of Christ’s earthly life, God has been—and still is—unseen. Yet His fingerprints are everywhere, not only in nature, but also in the Bible’s divine design, especially in the prophecies that foretell events thousands of years in advance. His providence—His guiding hand—in the history of nations, in the story of His church, and in the lives of individuals likewise testifies that He is deeply invested in and actively involved with humanity. According to Revelation 18:1, just before the second coming of Christ, the world will see a visible manifestation of God’s character (His glory) in the lives of His followers. In Matthew 16:18, Jesus declared that the gates of hell would not prevail against His church. Consider that He entrusted the establishment of His church to a small group of twelve disciples, who faced intense persecution from the Jewish authorities; that their converts would then endure the persecutions of the Roman Empire; and that, during the Dark Ages, much of the Christian church would apostatize and even persecute those who refused to compromise the pure faith. What, then, are the chances that a remnant of His church would still exist two thousand years later if it were not for His providence? Is God omniscient? “Great is our Lord, and of great power: his understanding is infinite.” —Psalm 147:5 “Dost thou know the balancings of the clouds, the wondrous works of him which is perfect in knowledge?” —Job 37:16 “For if our heart condemn us, God is greater than our heart, and knoweth all things.” —1 John 3:20 God is omniscient in the fullest sense of the word. Does God know my thoughts? “O LORD, thou hast searched me, and known me. Thou knowest my downsitting and mine uprising, thou understandest my thought afar off. Thou compassest [comprehend] my path and my lying down, and art acquainted with all my ways. For there is not a word in my tongue, but, lo, O LORD, thou knowest it altogether.” —Psalm 139:1-4 “And thou, Solomon my son, know thou the God of thy father, and serve him with a perfect heart and with a willing mind: for the LORD searcheth all hearts, and understandeth all the imaginations of the thoughts: if thou seek him, he will be found of thee; but if thou forsake him, he will cast thee off for ever.” —1 Chronicles 28:9 “I the LORD search the heart, I try the reins, even to give every man according to his ways, and according to the fruit of his doings.” —Jeremiah 17:10 As our Creator, God knows us better than we know ourselves. Just as there is no sin in our lives that God does not see, so there is no sorrow that He does not notice. He is acquainted with it all—every wound, disappointment, injustice, and abuse. Yet He is not merely aware; He longs to heal our wounds (Isaiah 53:5; Jeremiah 30:17; 33:6), restore what was lost (Isaiah 43:18-19; 51:3; Joel 2:25), comfort our sorrows (Psalm 147:3; Isaiah 57:18), make right every wrong (Romans 12:19), forgive every confessed sin (Psalm 103:2-4; 1 John 1:9), cleanse every defilement (Ezekiel 36:25), and set us free from every addiction (Luke 4:18). He who created the heavens and the earth by the power of His Word (Genesis 1:1; Psalm 33:6) has the same power to recreate us by that same Word (1 Peter 1:23; 2 Corinthians 5:17), the Bible, but only if we let Him (Revelation 3:20). Does God know the future? “Remember the former things of old: for I am God, and there is none else; I am God, and there is none like me, declaring the end from the beginning, and from ancient times the things that are not yet done, saying, My counsel shall stand, and I will do all my pleasure.” —Isaiah 46:9-10 “Surely the Lord GOD will do nothing, but he revealeth his secret unto his servants the prophets.” —Amos 3:7 “My frame was not hidden from You, when I was made in secret, and skillfully wrought in the lowest parts of the earth. Your eyes saw my substance, being yet unformed. And in Your book they all were written, the days fashioned for me, when as yet there were none of them.” —Psalm 139:15-16, NKJV “Before I formed thee in the belly I knew thee; and before thou camest forth out of the womb I sanctified thee, and I ordained thee a prophet unto the nations.” —Jeremiah 1:5 Not only does God know the future, but He also reveals it beforehand—to strengthen our faith in Him and to prepare us for what is to come. The Bible is full of prophecy for this very reason. But God’s foreknowledge has a personal dimension as well, for He knows our individual futures and prepares and equips us to face whatever trials may come our way. More than that, He walks with us through them (Isaiah 43:1-2), just as He walked through the fiery furnace with the three Hebrew worthies (Daniel 3:22-25), and just as He was in the boat with His disciples during the storm on the sea (Mark 4:37-40). As long as Jesus was with them, they were safe, for it was impossible for Him who made the sea to perish in it. When storms come into our own lives, we can rest in the promise that He will never allow us to be tempted beyond what we can bear (1 Corinthians 10:13), and that whatever He does allow, He will ultimately work out for our good (Romans 8:28). Waggoner, E. J. “Carest Thou Not That We Perish?” The Signs of the Times, vol. 17, no. 38, 21 Sept. 1891. What comfort does this bring? “Forasmuch as ye know that ye were not redeemed with corruptible things, as silver and gold, from your vain conversation received by tradition from your fathers; but with the precious blood of Christ, as of a lamb without blemish and without spot: who verily was foreordained before the foundation of the world, but was manifest in these last times for you.” —1 Peter 1:18-20 “And all that dwell upon the earth shall worship him, whose names are not written in the book of life of the Lamb slain from the foundation of the world.” —Revelation 13:8 “Who hath saved us, and called us with a holy calling, not according to our works, but according to his own purpose and grace, which was given us in Christ Jesus before the world began, but is now made manifest by the appearing of our Saviour Jesus Christ, who hath abolished death, and hath brought life and immortality to light through the gospel:” —2 Timothy 1:9-10 Because God is never caught off guard by any development, Satan’s rebellion in heaven was doomed from the start (Ezekiel 28:17-19), for God foresaw it and was prepared for it. He was likewise prepared for humanity’s fall, for Peter writes that Christ “was foreordained before the foundation of the world” (1 Peter 1:18-20), meaning that before Adam and Eve sinned, Christ had already offered Himself as their surety. This is the good news of the gospel, because no matter how unconquerable sin, evil, and death may now appear, God’s righteousness, love, and life will ultimately triumph (1 Corinthians 15:54-57). Does God predestine who is saved? “I call heaven and earth to record this day against you, that I have set before you life and death, blessing and cursing: therefore choose life, that both thou and thy seed may live: that thou mayest love the LORD thy God, and that thou mayest obey his voice, and that thou mayest cleave unto him: for he is thy life, and the length of thy days: that thou mayest dwell in the land which the LORD sware unto thy fathers, to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, to give them.” —Deuteronomy 30:19-20 “And if it seem evil unto you to serve the LORD, choose you this day whom ye will serve; whether the gods which your fathers served that were on the other side of the flood, or the gods of the Amorites, in whose land ye dwell: but as for me and my house, we will serve the LORD.” —Joshua 24:15 “And Elijah came unto all the people, and said, How long halt ye between two opinions? if the LORD be God, follow him: but if Baal, then follow him. And the people answered him not a word.” —1 Kings 18:21 God’s foreknowledge does not negate anyone’s freedom of choice. He respects free will, even when He knows it will cost Him everything; after all, He knew Satan would rebel against Him, yet He still created him. Why? Because God is love, and a foundational element of love is freedom of choice—freedom that always carries the risk that the one being loved may choose not to reciprocate. Love is often expressed most vividly under trying circumstances. If God had created only angels whom He knew would remain loyal to Him, He would have limited Himself to a love that lacked depth—one that had never been “tried in the fire.” And a shallow expression of love can awaken only the same love in return. But God desires to reveal a love that “passeth knowledge” (Ephesians 3:19). Satan’s fall provided God an opportunity to display a love—by offering His Son for the sins of a rebellious world—that would never have been possible otherwise. This love, in turn, awakens a far greater love and devotion, not only from the redeemed human race but also from the angels who remained loyal to Him. God’s respect for freedom of choice dismantles the idea of predestination—of God predetermining who will be saved or lost. Imagine a pilot flying over a long, dark, one-way tunnel as two cars enter from opposite ends—both without headlights. The pilot knows disaster will soon follow, but his foreknowledge in no way impedes or imposes itself upon the drivers’ choice to enter that tunnel. Predestination is a dangerous teaching because it can lead people to live as though their decisions and actions do not matter, believing their destiny has already been determined. Scripture, however, teaches the exact opposite: our words and actions do matter, for we will be held accountable for them (Matthew 12:36; Romans 14:12; Revelation 22:12). Jacobus Arminius was a 16th-century Dutch Reformer who rediscovered the biblical teaching of free will, now known as Arminianism. He rejected both the Calvinist doctrine of predestination and the idea that all will ultimately be saved (Universalism). Is He the source of all wisdom? “And he changeth the times and the seasons: he removeth kings, and setteth up kings: he giveth wisdom unto the wise, and knowledge to them that know understanding.” —Daniel 2:21 “If any of you lacks wisdom, let him ask of God, who gives to all liberally and without reproach, and it will be given to him.” —James 1:5, NKJV “For the LORD giveth wisdom: out of his mouth cometh knowledge and understanding.” —Proverbs 2:6 After Adam and Eve ate from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, humanity became exposed to the knowledge of evil—with all its pain, misery, and suffering—which was never God’s design. Yet even all genuinely good human wisdom is not inherently ours, but His—a profound truth that removes any temptation to glory in ourselves (2 Corinthians 10:17; Galatians 6:14). How many gods are there? “Tell ye, and bring them near; yea, let them take counsel together: who hath declared this from ancient time? who hath told it from that time? have not I the LORD? and there is no God else beside me; a just God and a Saviour; there is none beside me.” —Isaiah 45:21 “To whom then will ye liken me, or shall I be equal? saith the Holy One. Lift up your eyes on high, and behold who hath created these things, that bringeth out their host by number: he calleth them all by names by the greatness of his might, for that he is strong in power; not one faileth.” —Isaiah 40:25-26 “What profiteth the graven image that the maker thereof hath graven it; the molten image, and a teacher of lies, that the maker of his work trusteth therein, to make dumb idols? Woe unto him that saith to the wood, Awake; to the dumb stone, Arise, it shall teach! Behold, it is laid over with gold and silver, and there is no breath at all in the midst of it. But the LORD is in his holy temple: let all the earth keep silence before him.” —Habakkuk 2:18-20 “Neither is there salvation in any other: for there is none other name under heaven given among men, whereby we must be saved.” —Acts 4:12 There are countless gods across the world’s religions, but the Bible declares that there is only one true God, that there is salvation in no other, and that one fallen angel—Satan—wages war against Him for the worship of humanity. Though Satan aspires to be like God (Isaiah 14:12-14), he is—and will always remain—a created being (Ezekiel 28:15). Since Satan especially covets the worship that belongs to God alone (though not His character, interestingly enough), it is unsurprising that, just before the second coming of Christ, the great test that will divide all humanity into two groups will revolve around worship. God’s exclusive claim to divinity completely extinguishes the idea that mankind possesses inherent divinity or could attain it through practices such as yoga, mantra recitation, energy healing, or various Eastern meditation techniques. We are—and always will be—created beings. God does promise to bestow His character upon His followers (and what an honor that is), but we will never be divine—not even in heaven. The redeemed will live forever in heaven, not because they are immortal, but because God, who alone is immortal (1 Timothy 6:15-16), sustains their life. God’s declaration that He is the only true God may seem politically incorrect in an ecumenical world trending toward unity among religions. After all, what gives Him the right to make such a bold and exclusive claim? What sets the Christian God apart from all other gods is the fact that Jesus is the only One who died for His creation. What other god set aside his divine nature, took on the nature of his created beings, and died at their hands and for their sins? There is only One. How did God create the universe? “By the word of the LORD were the heavens made; and all the host of them by the breath of his mouth. He gathereth the waters of the sea together as an heap: he layeth up the depth in storehouses. Let all the earth fear the LORD: let all the inhabitants of the world stand in awe of him. For he spake, and it was done; he commanded, and it stood fast.” —Psalm 33:6-9 “Through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of God, so that things which are seen were not made of things which do appear.” —Hebrews 11:3 “For this they willingly are ignorant of, that by the word of God the heavens were of old, and the earth standing out of the water and in the water.” —2 Peter 3:5 All God had to do was speak, and immediately atoms came into existence and cells formed in obedience to His Word, for His Word possesses creative power. Because God never changes (Malachi 3:6), Jesus’ earthly life revealed that He had—and still has—the same power over creation (Mark 4:39) as when He spoke it into existence (Colossians 1:16; John 1:1-3). Does He still create by His Word? “Husbands, love your wives, even as Christ also loved the church, and gave himself for it; that he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of water by the word, that he might present it to himself a glorious church, not having spot, or wrinkle, or any such thing; but that it should be holy and without blemish.” —Ephesians 5:25-27 “Of his own will begat he us with the word of truth, that we should be a kind of firstfruits of his creatures.” —James 1:18 “Seeing ye have purified your souls in obeying the truth through the Spirit unto unfeigned love of the brethren, see that ye love one another with a pure heart fervently: being born again, not of corruptible seed, but of incorruptible, by the word of God, which liveth and abideth for ever. For all flesh is as grass, and all the glory of man as the flower of grass. The grass withereth, and the flower thereof falleth away: but the word of the Lord endureth for ever. And this is the word which by the gospel is preached unto you.” —1 Peter 1:22-25 The same creative power that spoke the worlds into existence out of nothing is still at work to speak His righteousness into existence in us—out of nothing—for we have no righteousness of our own (Isaiah 64:6). God’s power never changes; therefore, He exercises that same creative power in the re-creation of His image in us through the Holy Spirit (Titus 3:4-7), as we take hold of His promises by faith, especially those expressed in His Ten Commandments. Why are the Ten Commandments promises? Because God knows that we have no power to keep them. The truth is He requires only that which He already gives. This is why He begins the Decalogue with the declaration that He is the Lord who delivered us out of bondage—bondage to sin. This is a fact, a finished work (John 19:30), for Christ overcame sin—our sins—in human flesh—our flesh (Philippians 2:7-8; Hebrews 4:15). Do we believe it? After this opening declaration, God proceeds to spell out what His deliverance means in practical terms by giving us ten promises. In essence He says, “Because I have already delivered you—in Christ—from the bondage of sin, you will no longer have other gods before Me, nor worship idols, nor take My name in vain by living hypocritically; you will keep My Sabbath holy and honor your parents; you will not kill, nor commit adultery, nor steal, nor lie, nor covet.” Do we believe Him? This is the gospel proclaimed in the Ten Commandments, to be received by faith alone. “You are not to read or hear the word of God, and say, I must do that, I will do that. You are to open the heart to that word, that it may accomplish the will of God in you. It is not you who are to do it, but it. “It,” the word of God itself, is to do it, and you are to let it. “Let the word of Christ dwell in you.” This is stated in another place thus: “When ye receive the word of God which ye heard of us, ye received it not as the word of men, but as it is in truth, the word of God, which effectually worketh also in you that believe.” Thus it is the word of God that must work in you. You are not to work to do the word of God: the word of God is to work in you to cause you to do. “Whereunto I also labor, striving according to his working, which worketh in me mightily.”” —A. T. Jones & E. J. Waggoner, Lessons on Faith, p. 104. How is God glorified? “The heavens declare the glory of God; the skies proclaim the work of his hands. Day after day they pour forth speech; night after night they reveal knowledge.” —Psalm 19:1-2, NIV “If ye abide in me, and my words abide in you, ye shall ask what ye will, and it shall be done unto you. Herein is my Father glorified, that ye bear much fruit; so shall ye be my disciples.” —John 15:7-8 “But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, long-suffering, gentleness, goodness, faith, meekness, temperance: against such there is no law.” —Galatians 5:22-23 “The Spirit of the Lord GOD is upon me; because the LORD hath anointed me to preach good tidings unto the meek; he hath sent me to bind up the brokenhearted, to proclaim liberty to the captives, and the opening of the prison to them that are bound; to proclaim the acceptable year of the LORD, and the day of vengeance of our God; to comfort all that mourn; to appoint unto them that mourn in Zion, to give unto them beauty for ashes, the oil of joy for mourning, the garment of praise for the spirit of heaviness; that they might be called trees of righteousness, the planting of the LORD, that he might be glorified.” —Isaiah 61:1-3 God is glorified through the marvelous works of His creation: the awe-inspiring sunset, the starry skies on a clear night, the fragrant meadow filled with colorful flowers, the majestic snow-capped mountains, the birds singing their cheerful songs, and yes—the people once marred by sin who have permitted God to completely transform their characters so that they reflect His—the most magnificent wonder of all. What is His character like? “And we have known and believed the love that God hath to us. God is love; and he that dwelleth in love dwelleth in God, and God in him.” —1 John 4:16 “The LORD hath appeared of old unto me, saying, Yea, I have loved thee with an everlasting love: therefore with lovingkindness have I drawn thee.” —Jeremiah 31:3 “And the LORD passed by before him, and proclaimed, The LORD, The LORD God, merciful and gracious, longsuffering, and abundant in goodness and truth, keeping mercy for thousands, forgiving iniquity and transgression and sin, and that will by no means clear the guilty; visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children, and upon the children’s children, unto the third and to the fourth generation.” —Exodus 34:6-7 “To declare, I say, at this time his righteousness: that he might be just, and the justifier of him which believeth in Jesus.” —Romans 3:26 God is love, yet He is also perfectly just. He does not clear the guilty nor overlook sin, but takes that guilt and sin upon Himself, offering the sinner a second chance (John 8:11). He is patient, yet not indulgent—willing to chasten as a loving Father would, always for our eternal good. Never one to use force or coercion, He gently draws us into a relationship with Him, yet He honors our freedom if we continually resist. His mercy does not distinguish between the just and the unjust, and He pours out His blessings even on those who deserve them least (Psalm 145:9; Matthew 5:45; Romans 5:8). He is our heavenly Father who risked everything to spend eternity with His beloved sons and daughters. But because He is also just, all who refuse His free offer of life in Christ must bear the consequence of their sin—the forfeiture of their lives—for the wages of sin is death (Romans 6:23). Yet this is not God’s desire for anyone, for Christ has already borne this death on our behalf! It bears emphasizing: the wages of sin is death—not eternal torment in hell for a brief life of sin, nor a continuation of life as a disembodied spirit. This death includes both the first and the second death, because all the dead, whether saved or lost, will be resurrected again. The saved will be resurrected at Christ’s second coming, never to die again, while the lost will be resurrected at the end of the millennium for God’s final judgment. How faithful is He? “Let your conversation be without covetousness; and be content with such things as ye have: for he hath said, I will never leave thee, nor forsake thee.” —Hebrews 13:5 “Can a woman forget her sucking child, that she should not have compassion on the son of her womb? yea, they may forget, yet will I not forget thee. Behold, I have graven thee upon the palms of my hands.” —Isaiah 49:15-16 “That Christ may dwell in your hearts by faith; that ye, being rooted and grounded in love, may be able to comprehend with all saints what is the breadth, and length, and depth, and height; and to know the love of Christ, which passeth knowledge, that ye might be filled with all the fulness of God.” —Ephesians 3:17-19 It is often said that the bond between a mother and her child is the strongest human bond there is, but God’s love for each of us is even stronger—far beyond what we can imagine. For this reason, all who are saved will be saved not because of anything they accomplish, but because they give the power of God’s love free rein to work and be manifested in their lives. All who commit themselves to Him—daily choosing His will over their own (Luke 22:42; 1 Corinthians 15:31)—He will faithfully keep in His care, as He cleanses and transforms their character to reflect His own (Philippians 1:6; Hebrews 12:2; Jude 1:24). Will His name ever cease to be blessed? “Praise ye the LORD. Praise, O ye servants of the LORD, praise the name of the LORD. Blessed be the name of the LORD from this time forth and for evermore. From the rising of the sun unto the going down of the same the LORD’S name is to be praised. The LORD is high above all nations, and his glory above the heavens. Who is like unto the LORD our God, who dwelleth on high, who humbleth himself to behold the things that are in heaven, and in the earth! He raiseth up the poor out of the dust, and lifteth the needy out of the dunghill; that he may set him with princes, even with the princes of his people.” —Psalm 113:1-8 “I will extol thee, my God, O king; and I will bless thy name for ever and ever. Every day will I bless thee; and I will praise thy name for ever and ever. Great is the LORD, and greatly to be praised; and his greatness is unsearchable. One generation shall praise thy works to another, and shall declare thy mighty acts. I will speak of the glorious honor of thy majesty, and of thy wondrous works. And men shall speak of the might of thy terrible acts: and I will declare thy greatness. They shall abundantly utter the memory of thy great goodness, and shall sing of thy righteousness. The LORD is gracious, and full of compassion; slow to anger, and of great mercy. The LORD is good to all: and his tender mercies are over all his works. All thy works shall praise thee, O LORD; and thy saints shall bless thee. They shall speak of the glory of thy kingdom, and talk of thy power; to make known to the sons of men his mighty acts, and the glorious majesty of his kingdom.” —Psalm 145:1-12 God’s name will be praised throughout the ceaseless ages of eternity. Why? Simply because of who He is. And who will be foremost in praising Him? The redeemed humanity—those who have firsthand experience of His power to fully recreate and restore His image in those who were once totally captive to sin (Isaiah 61:1). They will talk—and be a visible manifestation—of His mighty acts and will sing of His righteousness and the “glorious majesty of His kingdom” (Psalm 145:12).",

He did not just forgive the sins of the paralytic, but He also healed him from the disease, and He wants the same complete healing for me as well. Does my body belong to me? “What? know ye not that your body is the temple of the Holy Ghost which is in you, which ye have of God, and ye are not your own? For ye are bought with a price: therefore glorify God in your body, and in your spirit, which are God’s.” —1 Corinthians 6:19-20 My body belongs to God because 1) He created it, and 2) He redeemed it at the cross. It is to be a temple of the Holy Spirit, enabling me to bring Him glory in my body and spirit! What does God invite me to do with my body? “I beseech you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God, that ye present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God, which is your reasonable service. And be not conformed to this world: but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind, that ye may prove what is that good, and acceptable, and perfect, will of God.” —Romans 12:1-2 God calls on me to present my body as a living and holy sacrifice to Him—my Maker and Redeemer. Then I am to be transformed by the renewing of my mind (note the tight connection between the body and mind). Once more, Jesus does not just want to forgive my sins; He wants to cleanse, heal, and restore His image in me by wholly transforming me! In what things am I to bring God glory? How? “Whether therefore ye eat, or drink, or whatsoever ye do, do all to the glory of God.” —1 Corinthians 10:31 “But my God shall supply all your need according to his riches in glory by Christ Jesus.” —Philippians 3:19 “Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and ye shall find; knock, and it shall be opened unto you: for every one that asketh receiveth; and he that seeketh findeth; and to him that knocketh it shall be opened.” —Matthew 7:7-8 Paul invites me to bring God glory in everything that I do, including the things I eat and drink. This is a high standard that I cannot reach in my own power, but God has made ample provision for this to become a reality in my life by the grace and power of Christ, as long as I do not frustrate His grace with a perverse will. If I ask Jesus to help me live a life that glorifies Him then He will gladly answer that prayer. And because God is love (1 John 4:8), His glory is my good. What does the Bible say about alcohol? “Wine is a mocker, strong drink is raging: and whosoever is deceived thereby is not wise.” —Proverbs 20:1 “Who hath woe? who hath sorrow? who hath contentions? who hath babbling? who hath wounds without cause? who hath redness of eyes? They that tarry long at the wine; they that go to seek mixed wine. Look not thou upon the wine when it is red, when it giveth his colour in the cup, when it moveth itself aright. At the last it biteth like a serpent, and stingeth like an adder.” —Proverbs 23:29-32 “Woe unto them that rise up early in the morning, that they may follow strong drink; that continue until night, till wine inflame them!” —Isaiah 5:11 “For they eat the bread of wickedness, and drink the wine of violence.” —Proverbs 4:17 The Bible is clear and direct in its condemnation of wine and other alcoholic beverages, and science is now agreeing too. Studies have shown that alcohol is toxic to the cells and no amount is actually safe. Wine does contain beneficial flavonoids that help fight free radicals in the body, but so does grape juice! Why should I not consume alcohol? “It is not for kings, O Lemuel, it is not for kings to drink wine; nor for princes strong drink: lest they drink, and forget the law, and pervert the judgment of any of the afflicted.” —Proverbs 31:4-5 “And they sung a new song, saying, Thou art worthy to take the book, and to open the seals thereof: for thou wast slain, and hast redeemed us to God by thy blood out of every kindred, and tongue, and people, and nation; and hast made us unto our God kings and priests: and we shall reign on the earth.” —Revelation 5:9-10 “Wherefore gird up the loins of your mind, be sober, and hope to the end for the grace that is to be brought unto you at the revelation of Jesus Christ.” —1 Peter 1:13 “Finally, my brethren, be strong in the Lord, and in the power of his might. Put on the whole armour of God, that ye may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil. For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places.” —Ephesians 6:10-12 Proverbs plainly says that alcoholic drinks pervert the judgment, and as such, they are not suitable for kings and princes. In Revelation we learn that we are made to be kings and priests to God, which is why Peter calls us to be sober, to bind the mind for action, like a soldier binds his belt in preparation for battle, because our battle is not with flesh and blood; it’s a battle with spiritual forces, and the outcome has eternal consequences. What was the original diet? “And God said, “See, I have given you every herb that yields seed which is on the face of all the earth, and every tree whose fruit yields seed; to you it shall be for food.” —Genesis 1:29, NKJV “Thorns also and thistles shall it bring forth to thee; and thou shalt eat the herb of the field.” —Genesis 3:18 “A righteous man regardeth the life of his beast: but the tender mercies of the wicked are cruel.” —Proverbs 12:10 The original diet in Eden was a whole foods diet composed of plants that yield seeds. Root vegetables were added later after the fall of Adam and Eve. What was the diet after the flood? “Of every clean beast thou shalt take to thee by sevens, the male and his female: and of beasts that are not clean by two, the male and his female.” —Genesis 7:2 “Every moving thing that lives shall be food for you. I have given you all things, even as the green herbs. But you shall not eat flesh with its life, that is, its blood.” —Genesis 9:3-4, NKJV Meat was added to the diet after the flood because when Noah stepped off the ark all the vegetation had been destroyed. But God made a distinction between clean and unclean animals because seven pairs of every clean animal came onto the ark and only two pairs of the unclean, so Noah and his family were allowed to eat every clean animal, as long as the blood was drained. Which animals are clean? “And the LORD spake unto Moses and to Aaron, saying unto them, Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, These are the beasts which ye shall eat among all the beasts that are on the earth. Whatsoever parteth the hoof, and is clovenfooted, and cheweth the cud, among the beasts, that shall ye eat. Nevertheless these shall ye not eat of them that chew the cud, or of them that divide the hoof: as the camel, because he cheweth the cud, but divideth not the hoof; he is unclean unto you. And the coney, because he cheweth the cud, but divideth not the hoof; he is unclean unto you. And the hare, because he cheweth the cud, but divideth not the hoof; he is unclean unto you. And the swine, though he divide the hoof, and be clovenfooted, yet he cheweth not the cud; he is unclean to you. Of their flesh shall ye not eat, and their carcase shall ye not touch; they are unclean to you. ““These shall ye eat of all that are in the waters: whatsoever hath fins and scales in the waters, in the seas, and in the rivers, them shall ye eat. And all that have not fins and scales in the seas, and in the rivers, of all that move in the waters, and of any living thing which is in the waters, they shall be an abomination unto you: they shall be even an abomination unto you; ye shall not eat of their flesh, but ye shall have their carcases in abomination. Whatsoever hath no fins nor scales in the waters, that shall be an abomination unto you.” —Leviticus 11:1-12 The unclean animals are scavengers and bottom feeders; some examples include cats, dogs, horses, camels, eagles, vultures, hogs, squirrels, rabbits, catfish, eels, lobsters, clams, crabs, shrimp, oysters, and frogs. These laws are not just for the Jewish nation because Noah was not Jewish, and they were not done away with at the cross because our physiology did not change at the cross. If these were unfit for human consumption before the cross then they are still unfit today. Why does God restrict unclean animals? “For the LORD God is a sun and shield: the LORD will give grace and glory: no good thing will he withhold from them that walk uprightly.” —Psalm 84:11 “And said, If thou wilt diligently hearken to the voice of the LORD thy God, and wilt do that which is right in his sight, and wilt give ear to his commandments, and keep all his statutes, I will put none of these diseases upon thee, which I have brought upon the Egyptians: for I am the LORD that healeth thee.” —Exodus 15:26 “If ye know these things, happy are ye if ye do them.” —John 13:17 “Thou wilt shew me the path of life: in thy presence is fulness of joy; at thy right hand there are pleasures for evermore.” —Psalm 16:11 We are not to consume unclean animals because they are detrimental to our health. God’s mission is to bring healing into our bodies and minds, so He never withholds anything that is good for us. He is also far better at pleasure and happiness than Satan because His way does not lead to a crash after the high, or desensitization that requires increasingly higher doses, or addiction. It may seem difficult, overwhelming, or even impossible to make these dietary changes, but when I don’t have the willpower myself, I can give Him my will, and He will give me the power. What about Peter’s vision in Acts 10? “On the morrow, as they went on their journey, and drew nigh unto the city, Peter went up upon the housetop to pray about the sixth hour: and he became very hungry, and would have eaten: but while they made ready, he fell into a trance, and saw heaven opened, and a certain vessel descending unto him, as it had been a great sheet knit at the four corners, and let down to the earth: wherein were all manner of fourfooted beasts of the earth, and wild beasts, and creeping things, and fowls of the air. And there came a voice to him, Rise, Peter; kill, and eat. But Peter said, Not so, Lord; for I have never eaten any thing that is common or unclean. And the voice spake unto him again the second time, What God hath cleansed, that call not thou common. This was done thrice: and the vessel was received up again into heaven.” —Acts 10:9-16 “And he said unto them, Ye know how that it is an unlawful thing for a man that is a Jew to keep company, or come unto one of another nation; but God hath shewed me that I should not call any man common or unclean.” —Acts 10:28 The subject of Peter’s vision was people, not animals. God was telling him that he should not view Gentiles as unclean because he was about to have Gentile visitors, whom he would have refused to see, as Jewish law forbade associating with Gentiles (Acts 10:28), but after receiving this vision, Peter welcomed them. What does Isaiah say about ignoring dietary laws? “I am sought of them that asked not for me; I am found of them that sought me not: I said, Behold me, behold me, unto a nation that was not called by my name. I have spread out my hands all the day unto a rebellious people, which walketh in a way that was not good, after their own thoughts; a people that provoketh me to anger continually to my face; that sacrificeth in gardens, and burneth incense upon altars of brick; which remain among the graves, and lodge in the monuments, which eat swine’s flesh, and broth of abominable things is in their vessels; which say, Stand by thyself, come not near to me; for I am holier than thou. These are a smoke in my nose, a fire that burneth all the day.” —Isaiah 65:1-5 “For, behold, the LORD will come with fire, and with his chariots like a whirlwind, to render his anger with fury, and his rebuke with flames of fire. For by fire and by his sword will the LORD plead with all flesh: and the slain of the LORD shall be many. They that sanctify themselves, and purify themselves in the gardens behind one tree in the midst, eating swine’s flesh, and the abomination, and the mouse, shall be consumed together, saith the LORD.” —Isaiah 66:15-17 “Say unto them, As I live, saith the Lord GOD, I have no pleasure in the death of the wicked; but that the wicked turn from his way and live: turn ye, turn ye from your evil ways; for why will ye die, O house of Israel?” —Ezekiel 33:11 God cannot save those who knowingly go down the path of destruction, nor does He enjoy destroying them, but eventually there will come a point when He can do nothing else but leave them to the consequences of their own destructive choices. What promise does the Bible give? “For we have not a high priest which cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities; but was in all points tempted like as we are, yet without sin. Let us therefore come boldly unto the throne of grace, that we may obtain mercy, and find grace to help in time of need.” —Hebrews 4:15-16 Jesus knows my struggles because He experienced them Himself, and so He bids me to come to His throne that I may receive mercy and grace to meet them with boldness and overcome.",

      "body": "How does the Bible describe the law of God? “The works of his hands are verity and judgment; all his commandments are sure. They stand fast for ever and ever, and are done in truth and uprightness.” —Psalm 111:7-8 “The law of the LORD is perfect, converting the soul: the testimony of the LORD is sure, making wise the simple. The statutes of the LORD are right, rejoicing the heart: the commandment of the LORD is pure, enlightening the eyes.” —Psalm 19:7-8 Every government has laws to ensure order and protection for its citizens. It is no different with the King of the universe and His government, except His law is eternal, true, upright, perfect, sure, right, and pure. God’s dominion knows no bounds, and His law, therefore, is universal as well, so even though it’s mostly neglected on earth, it is still binding. Does it have a role to play in my life? “The fear of the LORD is clean, enduring for ever: the judgments of the LORD are true and righteous altogether. More to be desired are they than gold, yea, than much fine gold: sweeter also than honey and the honeycomb. Moreover by them is thy servant warned: and in keeping of them there is great reward.” —Psalm 19:9-11 “And the LORD commanded us to do all these statutes, to fear the LORD our God, for our good always, that he might preserve us alive, as it is at this day.” —Deuteronomy 6:24 “My son, forget not my law; but let thine heart keep my commandments: for length of days, and long life, and peace, shall they add to thee.” —Proverbs 3:1-2 “Let us hear the conclusion of the whole matter: fear God, and keep his commandments: for this is the whole duty of man.” —Ecclesiastes 12:13 Satan rebelled against God’s law in heaven because he didn’t want to be restricted by it, and when Adam and Even believed his lie about defining good and evil for themselves (Genesis 3:5), his lawless kingdom took over earth as well. Our Creator God defines good and evil for us in His law because He knows what’s best for us better than we will ever know ourselves. And His law is not a restriction; it’s there to be a blessing, to protect us from evils, such as murder, adultery, theft, and falsehood, ensuring a happy and harmonious existence for all. How else does the law affect me? “If ye fulfil the royal law according to the scripture, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself, ye do well: But if ye have respect to persons, ye commit sin, and are convinced of the law as transgressors. For whosoever shall keep the whole law, and yet offend in one point, he is guilty of all. For he that said, Do not commit adultery, said also, Do not kill. Now if thou commit no adultery, yet if thou kill, thou art become a transgressor of the law. So speak ye, and so do, as they that shall be judged by the law of liberty.” —James 2:8-12 “For as many as are of the works of the law are under the curse: for it is written, Cursed is every one that continueth not in all things which are written in the book of the law to do them.” —Galatians 3:10 “But we are all as an unclean thing, and all our righteousnesses are as filthy rags; and we all do fade as a leaf; and our iniquities, like the wind, have taken us away.” —Isaiah 64:6 When James is talking about the law, he is referring to the Ten Commandments, and he actually says it’s not enough to keep some or even most of them. Breaking even one is breaking them all. Consequently, there is no human being who hasn’t been condemned by the law, which is the standard during the judgment. Does God leave me in my condemned state? “But that no man is justified by the law in the sight of God, it is evident: for, The just shall live by faith.” —Galatians 3:11 “For sin shall not have dominion over you: for ye are not under the law, but under grace.” —Romans 6:14 “Being justified freely by his grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus: whom God hath set forth to be a propitiation through faith in his blood, to declare his righteousness for the remission of sins that are past, through the forbearance of God; to declare, I say, at this time his righteousness: that he might be just, and the justifier of him which believeth in Jesus. Where is boasting then? It is excluded. By what law? of works? Nay: but by the law of faith. Therefore we conclude that a man is justified by faith without the deeds of the law.” —Romans 3:24-28 Because Jesus is the Creator God, He was able to take the condemnation of the law on Himself at the cross, on behalf of all humanity, so that every person who accepts Him by faith in His substitutionary sacrifice could stand before the law clothed in His perfectly righteous life! Does that mean we are now free to break it? “Therefore we conclude that a man is justified by faith without the deeds of the law. Is he the God of the Jews only? Is he not also of the Gentiles? Yes, of the Gentiles also: seeing it is one God, which shall justify the circumcision by faith, and uncircumcision through faith. Do we then make void the law through faith? God forbid: yea, we establish the law.” —Romans 3:28-31 “What then? shall we sin, because we are not under the law, but under grace? God forbid.” —Romans 6:15 “Think not that I am come to destroy the law, or the prophets: I am not come to destroy, but to fulfil. For verily I say unto you, Till heaven and earth pass, one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law, till all be fulfilled.” —Matthew 5:17-18 If you were caught speeding and the police officer wanted to give you a hefty fine, but decided to give you a warning instead, would you then go screeching out back on the highway to break the speed limit again? No, you would carefully watch your speed. Jesus’ death on the cross was an act of mercy and forgiveness for those who accept it, not a license to live lawlessly. What is the breaking of God’s law called? “Whosoever committeth sin transgresseth also the law: for sin is the transgression of the law.” —1 John 3:4 “Therefore by the deeds of the law there shall no flesh be justified in his sight: for by the law is the knowledge of sin.” —Romans 3:20 What does sin do? “Behold, the LORD’S hand is not shortened, that it cannot save; neither his ear heavy, that it cannot hear: But your iniquities have separated between you and your God, and your sins have hid his face from you, that he will not hear.” —Isaiah 59:1-2 “For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.” —Romans 6:23 Sin cannot exist in the presence of a holy God because at the root of sin is selfishness, which is abhorent to God’s character of love. As a result, sin creates separation between me and God, the Giver of life, and leads to eternal death if left untreated. What is the motivation for keeping His law? “If ye love me, keep my commandments.” —John 14:15 “For this is the love of God, that we keep his commandments: and his commandments are not grievous.” —1 John 5:3 “Then one of them, which was a lawyer, asked him a question, tempting him, and saying, Master, which is the great commandment in the law? Jesus said unto him, Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind. This is the first and great commandment. And the second is like unto it, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself. On these two commandments hang all the law and the prophets.” —Matthew 22:35-40 “Love worketh no ill to his neighbour: therefore love is the fulfilling of the law.” —Romans 13:10 Since selfishness is at the root of sin, and sin is the breaking of His law, then the law is really a law of love, dealing with my relationship with God (the first four commandments) and my neighbor (the last six). That’s why Jesus said that the entire law hangs on loving God and loving my neighbor. When there is genuine love present in a relationship then pleasing that person ceases to become a burden; in fact, without love for Jesus it’s not possible to keep His law. Can the law be fulfilled in my life? “For what the law could not do, in that it was weak through the flesh, God sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh, and for sin, condemned sin in the flesh: that the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit.” —Romans 8:3-4 If my heart is motivated by love for Jesus and filled with the Holy Spirit, then the law can be fulfilled in my life in Christ by faith. When I ask Him in faith, believing that He can and will accomplish it, He makes it a reality. Apart from His abiding presence in me (John 15:14-15), the law will never be fulfilled in my life, no matter how hard I try. Christ works in me when I surrender fully to Him—when I choose daily to die to self and pray, “Not my will, but Yours be done” (Matthew 26:39). What is one of the purposes of the law? “He who says, “I know Him,” and does not keep His commandments, is a liar, and the truth is not in him. But whoever keeps His word, truly the love of God is perfected in him. By this we know that we are in Him.” —1 John 2:4-5, NKJV “Not every one that saith unto me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of heaven; but he that doeth the will of my Father which is in heaven. Many will say to me in that day, Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied in thy name? and in thy name have cast out devils? and in thy name done many wonderful works? And then will I profess unto them, I never knew you: depart from me, ye that work iniquity.” —Matthew 7:21-23 “The heart is deceitful above all things, and desperately wicked: who can know it? I the LORD search the heart, I try the reins, even to give every man according to his ways, and according to the fruit of his doings.” —Jeremiah 17:9-10 “O LORD, thou hast searched me, and known me. Thou knowest my downsitting and mine uprising, thou understandest my thought afar off. Thou compassest my path and my lying down, and art acquainted with all my ways. For there is not a word in my tongue, but, lo, O LORD, thou knowest it altogether.” —Psalm 139:1-4 God knows me better than I know myself, and He knows if I truly love Him. The Ten Commandments are really a mirror that shows my genuine condition; they provide evidence letting me know if I truly love Him because it can be easy to deceive myself. Jesus says there will be people who served Him and thought they loved Him, but their lawlessness will say otherwise. What promise does God give me? “For this is the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel after those days, saith the Lord; I will put my laws into their mind, and write them in their hearts: and I will be to them a God, and they shall be to me a people.” —Hebrews 8:10 “Then will I sprinkle clean water upon you, and ye shall be clean: from all your filthiness, and from all your idols, will I cleanse you. A new heart also will I give you, and a new spirit will I put within you: and I will take away the stony heart out of your flesh, and I will give you an heart of flesh. And I will put my spirit within you, and cause you to walk in my statutes, and ye shall keep my judgments, and do them.” —Ezekiel 36:25-27 “Hitherto have ye asked nothing in my name: ask, and ye shall receive, that your joy may be full.” —John 16:34 “I delight to do thy will, O my God: yea, thy law is within my heart.” —Psalm 40:8 God promises to help me keep His commandments because He knows that I cannot overcome sin myself. But He does not force Himself on anyone, so I must ask, and the promise is He will write His law in my heart and mind, enabling me to walk in His commandments through the power of the Holy Spirit dwelling in me! The only one who can create a new heart in me is the One who created the world in Eden. If I take Him at His word, believing that He will keep this promise, He will do it according to my faith (Matthew 9:29), making it a delight for me to do His will (Psalm 40:8)! What are the Ten Commandments? “[First:] I am the LORD thy God, which have brought thee out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage. Thou shalt have no other gods before me.” —Exodus 20:2-3 “[Second:] Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image, or any likeness of any thing that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath, or that is in the water under the earth: Thou shalt not bow down thyself to them, nor serve them: for I the LORD thy God am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth generation of them that hate me; and shewing mercy unto thousands of them that love me, and keep my commandments.” —Exodus 20:4-6 “[Third:] Thou shalt not take the name of the LORD thy God in vain; for the LORD will not hold him guiltless that taketh his name in vain.” —Exodus 20:7 “[Fourth:] Remember the sabbath day, to keep it holy. Six days shalt thou labour, and do all thy work: but the seventh day is the sabbath of the LORD thy God: in it thou shalt not do any work, thou, nor thy son, nor thy daughter, thy manservant, nor thy maidservant, nor thy cattle, nor thy stranger that is within thy gates: For in six days the LORD made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that in them is, and rested the seventh day: wherefore the LORD blessed the sabbath day, and hallowed it.” —Exodus 20:8-11 “[Fifth:] Honour thy father and thy mother: that thy days may be long upon the land which the LORD thy God giveth thee.” —Exodus 20:12 “[Sixth:] Thou shalt not kill.” —Exodus 20:13 “[Seventh:] Thou shalt not commit adultery.” —Exodus 20:14 “[Eight:] Thou shalt not steal.” —Exodus 20:15 “[Ninth:] Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbour.” —Exodus 20:16 “[Tenth:] Thou shalt not covet thy neighbour’s house, thou shalt not covet thy neighbour’s wife, nor his manservant, nor his maidservant, nor his ox, nor his ass, nor any thing that is thy neighbour’s.” —Exodus 20:17 Did they change in the New Testament? “[First:] Then saith Jesus unto him, Get thee hence, Satan: for it is written, Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and him only shalt thou serve.” —Matthew 4:10 “[Second:] Little children, keep yourselves from idols.” —1 John 5:21 “[Third:] Let as many servants as are under the yoke count their own masters worthy of all honour, that the name of God and his doctrine be not blasphemed.” —1 Timothy 6:1 “[Fourth:] For he spake in a certain place of the seventh day on this wise, And God did rest the seventh day from all his works. … There remaineth therefore a rest to the people of God. For he that is entered into his rest, he also hath ceased from his own works, as God did from his.” —Hebrews 4:4, 9-10 “[Fifth:] Honour thy father and thy mother.” —Matthew 19:19 “[Sixth:] Thou shalt not kill.” —Romans 13:9 “[Seventh:] Thou shalt not commit adultery.” —Romans 13:9 “[Eight:] Thou shalt not steal.” —Romans 13:9 “[Ninth:] Thou shalt not bear false witness.” —Romans 13:9 “[Tenth:] Thou shalt not covet.” —Romans 7:7 Is it possible for the law to change? “Jesus Christ the same yesterday, and to day, and for ever.” —Hebrews 13:8 “And it is easier for heaven and earth to pass, than one tittle of the law to fail.” —Luke 16:17 “My covenant will I not break, nor alter the thing that is gone out of my lips.” —Psalm 89:34 The fact that Jesus had to die on the cross to pay for the penalty of lawlessness for us is the biggest evidence that the law of God is unchangeable. What is God’s law a reflection of? “[God is good:] And Jesus said unto him, Why callest thou me good? none is good, save one, that is, God.” —Luke 18:19 “[Law is good:] But we know that the law is good, if a man use it lawfully.” —1 Timothy 1:8 “[God is holy:] But the LORD of hosts shall be exalted in judgment, and God that is holy shall be sanctified in righteousness.” —Isaiah 5:16 “[Law is holy:] Wherefore the law is holy, and the commandment holy, and just, and good.” —Romans 7:12 “[God is perfect:] Be ye therefore perfect, even as your Father which is in heaven is perfect.” —Matthew 5:48 “[Law is perfect:] The law of the LORD is perfect, converting the soul: the testimony of the LORD is sure, making wise the simple.” —Psalms 19:7 “[God is pure:] And every man that hath this hope in him purifieth himself, even as he [Christ] is pure.” —1 John 3:3 “[Law is pure:] The commandment of the LORD is pure, enlightening the eyes.” —Psalms 19:8 “[God is just:] He is the Rock, his work is perfect: for all his ways are judgment: a God of truth and without iniquity, just and right is he.” —Deuteronomy 32:4 “[Law is just:] Wherefore the law is holy, and the commandment holy, and just, and good.” —Romans 7:12 “[God is true:] He that hath received his testimony hath set to his seal that God is true.” —John 3:33 “[Law is true:] The judgments of the LORD are true and righteous altogether.” —Psalms 19:9 “[God is spiritual:] For they drank of that spiritual Rock that followed them: and that Rock was Christ.” —1 Corinthians 10:4 “[Law is spiritual:] For we know that the law is spiritual: but I am carnal, sold under sin.” —Romans 7:14 “[God is righteousness:] In his days Judah shall be saved, and Israel shall dwell safely: and this is his name whereby he shall be called, THE LORD OUR RIGHTEOUSNESS.” —Jeremiah 23:6 “[Law is righteousness:] My tongue shall speak of thy word: for all thy commandments are righteousness.” —Psalms 119:172 “[God is faithful:] God is faithful, by whom ye were called unto the fellowship of his Son Jesus Christ our Lord.” —1 Corinthians 1:9 “[Law is faithful:] All thy commandments are faithful.” —Psalms 119:86 “[God is love:] He that loveth not knoweth not God; for God is love.” —1 John 4:8 “[Law is love:] Love worketh no ill to his neighbour: therefore love is the fulfilling of the law.” —Romans 13:10 “[God is unchangeable:] Every good gift and every perfect gift is from above, and cometh down from the Father of lights, with whom is no variableness, neither shadow of turning.” —James 1:17 “[Law is unchangeable:] For verily I say unto you, Till heaven and earth pass, one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law, till all be fulfilled.” —Matthew 5:18 “[God is everlasting:] And Abraham planted a grove in Beersheba, and called there on the name of the LORD, the everlasting God.” —Genesis 21:33 “[Law is everlasting:] The works of his hands are verity and judgment; all his commandments are sure. They stand fast for ever and ever, and are done in truth and uprightness.” —Psalms 111:7-8 The Ten Commandments are a reflection of God’s character in written form, and Jesus demonstrated what it looks like in human form. Through the law and Jesus’ life we may better comprehend God’s character. Because God cannot change, neither can His law. How does the devil feel about keeping God’s law? “And the dragon was wroth with the woman, and went to make war with the remnant of her seed, which keep the commandments of God, and have the testimony of Jesus Christ.” —Revelation 12:17 “Jesus replied, “And why do you break the command of God for the sake of your tradition? … Thus you nullify the word of God for the sake of your tradition. You hypocrites! Isaiah prophesied correctly about you: ‘These people honor Me with their lips, but their hearts are far from Me. They worship Me in vain; they teach as doctrine the precepts of men.’” —Matthew 15:3, 6-9 “It is time for thee, LORD, to work: for they have made void thy law.” —Psalm 119:126 The devil’s war against God and His law started in the courts of heaven and has been raging ever since here on Earth. Is it any surprise that the devil would try to persuade people that God’s law is no longer binding and even go as far as persecuting those who keep it? What does Revelation say about the saints? “Here is the patience of the saints: here are they that keep the commandments of God, and the faith of Jesus.” —Revelation 14:12 “Blessed are they that do his commandments, that they may have right to the tree of life, and may enter in through the gates into the city.” —Revelation 22:14 Those who are saved will be keeping the commandments of God, not because they are saved by doing so, but because of their love for Jesus.",

In this was manifested the love of God toward us, because that God sent his only begotten Son into the world, that we might live through him.” —1 John 4:8-9 What did God desire for Adam and Eve? “So God created man in his own image, in the image of God created he him; male and female created he them. And God blessed them, and God said unto them, Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it: and have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth. And God said, Behold, I have given you every herb bearing seed, which is upon the face of all the earth, and every tree, in the which is the fruit of a tree yielding seed; to you it shall be for meat. And to every beast of the earth, and to every fowl of the air, and to every thing that creepeth upon the earth, wherein there is life, I have given every green herb for meat: and it was so. And God saw every thing that he had made, and, behold, it was very good. And the evening and the morning were the sixth day.” —Genesis 1:27-31 God did all He could to give Adam and Eve the very best start. Everything He made was very good and designed to bless and make their life in the garden a joyful and invigorating experience. What changed once they sinned? “And they heard the voice of the LORD God walking in the garden in the cool of the day: and Adam and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the LORD God amongst the trees of the garden.” —Genesis 3:8 Sin introduced feelings of shame and guilt into Adam and Eve’s life, which created a separation between them and God and caused them to hide from Him presence, the Giver of life. What does sin lead to? “For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.” —Romans 6:23 “Whosoever committeth sin transgresseth also the law: for sin is the transgression of the law.” —1 John 3:4 Sin started the process of decay and death on the earth that would affect not just Adam and Eve, but every other living thing on it. Death was now a part of life becase they were separated from the Giver of life. Furthermore, the Bible defines sin as the transgression of God’s law, and the penalty for breaking it is death. How many have sinned? “For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God.” —Romans 3:23 All have succumbed to sin because once Adam and Eve sinned, it weakend their human nature and made it harder for them, and every succeeding generation, to resist it. Is there a solution to our predicament? “Therefore as by the offence of one, judgment came upon all men to condemnation; even so by the righteousness of one the free gift came upon all men unto justification of life. For as by one man’s disobedience many were made sinners, so by the obedience of one many shall be made righteous.” —Romans 5:18-19 God did not leave us in our sin, but promised us a path back to life and reconciliation with Him by offering His Son, Jesus Christ, as a substitute for us so we could be justified and made righteous by His perfect life. Are there multiple solutions to the sin problem? “Neither is there salvation in any other: for there is none other name under heaven given among men, whereby we must be saved.” —Acts 4:12 “Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.” —John 14:6 There is only one road that leads to salvation from sin, and that road is Jesus. Any other way—and there are many—cannot save us. Many have wondered how Jesus can make such an exclusive claim, considering the number of religions in the world, but it’s simple: Jesus is the only one who humbled Himself, came down from the glory of heaven, took on human nature, lived among His creation, and then died for their sins! No other religion has a god like that. How did Jesus redeem us from the condemnation of the law? “Christ hath redeemed us from the curse of the law, being made a curse for us: for it is written, Cursed is every one that hangeth on a tree.” —Galatians 3:13 “For he hath made him to be sin for us, who knew no sin; that we might be made the righteousness of God in him.” —2 Corinthians 5:21 Christ took our sins upon Himself and suffered their penalty on our behalf. What did this curse involve? “Thou hast put all things in subjection under his feet. For in that he put all in subjection under him, he left nothing that is not put under him. But now we see not yet all things put under him. But we see Jesus, who was made a little lower than the angels for the suffering of death, crowned with glory and honour; that he by the grace of God should taste death for every man.” —Hebrews 2:8-9 The penalty for sin is death, and Christ’s death on the cross paid that penalty for every single person. How can I receive forgiveness of my sins? “Repent ye therefore, and be converted, that your sins may be blotted out, when the times of refreshing shall come from the presence of the Lord.” —Acts 3:19 “Let the wicked forsake his way, and the unrighteous man his thoughts: and let him return unto the LORD, and he will have mercy upon him; and to our God, for he will abundantly pardon.” —Isaiah 55:7 Forsaking my way implies turning around and going in the opposite direction—from running away from God toward sin to running away from sin toward God. If I repent and have a desire to leave sin behind, the promise is I will receive forgiveness. Is any sin too great for God? “If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.” —1 John 1:9 How exactly am I saved? “For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God. Not of works, lest any man should boast.” —Ephesians 2:8-9 “Therefore we conclude that a man is justified by faith without the deeds of the law.” —Romans 3:28 “Therefore being justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ: by whom also we have access by faith into this grace wherein we stand, and rejoice in hope of the glory of God.” —Romans 5:1-2 “But that no man is justified by the law in the sight of God, it is evident: for, The just shall live by faith.” —Galatians 3:11 There is nothing I can do to earn salvation; it is a free gift that I receive by grace through faith in His love, His forgiveness, and His victory on the cross. The Protestant Reformation brought this marvelous truth to light after centuries of a counterfeit method of salvation focused on works. Sadly, however, Protestantism has begun to drift away from its original position. In 1999, the Catholic and Lutheran churches issued a Joint Declaration on the Doctrine of Justification, which includes this key statement: “By grace alone, in faith in Christ’s saving work and not because of any merit on our part, we are accepted by God …” Note that “by grace alone” is not the same as “by faith alone.” While it is true that we are saved by grace, that grace is appropriated by faith—without faith, there can be no grace. The joint statement elevates grace over faith, while the Bible emphasizes faith. This difference may not seem significant at first, but it becomes critical when viewed through the lens of Catholic teaching, which holds that the Church is the dispenser of grace from the treasury of merit, which includes not only Christ’s good works but also those of Mary and the saints. Am I saved by Christ’s saving work? “And almost all things are by the law purged with blood; and without shedding of blood is no remission.” —Hebrews 9:22 “In whom we have redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of sins, according to the riches of his grace.” —Ephesians 1:7 “Whom God hath set forth to be a propitiation through faith in his blood, to declare his righteousness for the remission of sins that are past, through the forbearance of God.” —Romans 3:25 The Bible is clear that it is not Christ’s works that save me, but His shed blood. In the Joint Declaration, the phrase “faith in Christ’s saving work” refers to the treasury of merit, which the Church dispenses to atone for sin; however, the Bible teaches that without the shedding of blood there is no remission of sin. The truth is Christ died for each person individually (Galatians 2:20). His death paid the penalty for my sins—the penalty that I was supposed to pay—while His righteous life satisfies the claims of the law upon me, namely, perfect righteousness, which my life could never meet (Romans 5:9-10). What happens once I accept God’s free gift? “There is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit.” —Romans 8:1 Once I turn away from my sins and accept Jesus as my Lord and Saviour, I’m no longer condemned because I’m covered by His perfect life and forgiven. What privilege do those who have received Christ have? “But as many as received him, to them gave he power to become the sons of God, even to them that believe on his name.” —John 1:12 Christ’s death on the cross restored the rift that occured between God and the human race when Adam and Eve sinned, and we can now once again be called sons and daughters of God! Can I know I have eternal life? “And this is the record, that God hath given to us eternal life, and this life is in his Son. He that hath the Son hath life; and he that hath not the Son of God hath not life. These things have I written unto you that believe on the name of the Son of God; that ye may know that ye have eternal life, and that ye may believe on the name of the Son of God.” —1 John 5:11-13 What role does choice play in salvation? “And if it seem evil unto you to serve the LORD, choose you this day whom ye will serve; whether the gods which your fathers served that were on the other side of the flood, or the gods of the Amorites, in whose land ye dwell: but as for me and my house, we will serve the LORD.” —Joshua 24:15 “I call heaven and earth to record this day against you, that I have set before you life and death, blessing and cursing: therefore choose life, that both thou and thy seed may live.” —Deuteronomy 30:19 “Behold, I stand at the door, and knock: if any man hear my voice, and open the door, I will come in to him, and will sup with him, and he with me.” —Revelation 3:20 God’s way of salvation has always been about respecting freedom of choice. He gave Satan the option to rebel, and He did not immediately destroy him when he did. God permitted Adam and Eve to rebel too. Likewise, I am free to choose whether I want to serve Him or not. Jesus wants to save every person (1 Timothy 2:3-4)—He wants me to choose Him—but He will not force Himself on anyone. In fact, this is a daily choice; I can choose, anytime, to leave Christ and go in another direction, which is why it’s imperative to reaffirm my decision and recommit myself to Him on a daily basis (Luke 9:23). Every single day is a gift from my Creator, and it’s my privilege to give it back to Him. What does it mean to accept Jesus as Savior and Lord? “But grow in grace, and in the knowledge of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ. To him be glory both now and for ever. Amen.” —2 Peter 3:18 Both are a fundamental aspect of salvation, but there is a difference between the two. Accepting Jesus as Savior means being saved from the penalty of sin (death) because He offers forgiveness for every sin that I’ve genuinely confessed and decided to forsake. Once forgiven, He credits me with His own righteousness so that my imperfect life is covered by His perfect life. Accepting Jesus as Lord, on the other hand, means surrendering my will to Him, thereby making Him the ruler of my life. This is a decision that takes place daily (Luke 9:23) because our natural desire is to do and live as we please, but the Bible calls this way of life sin (Isaiah 53:6) because our human nature, by default, is contrary to the law of God (Romans 8:7). The truth is God knows what is best for us better than we know ourselves, and He wants us to trust Him enough to allow Him to rule our lives, which, in turn, gives Him permission to mold us into Him image (Ephesians 4:13). This surrender is crucial, because without it He does not have the right to transform our characters to reflect the beauty of His character. What is God’s desire for me? “For this is good and acceptable in the sight of God our Savior, who desires all men to be saved and to come to the knowledge of the truth.” —1 Timothy 2:3-4, NKJV “For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.” —John 3:16",

      "title": "The Gospel in the Sanctuary",
      "body": "Why did God tell Moses to build a sanctuary? “And let them make me a sanctuary; that I may dwell among them.” —Exodus 25:8 The sanctuary was built so that God could dwell among His people. When Adam and Eve sinned, they lost the closeness they had with their Creator because sin separates us from Him (Isaiah 59:1-2). Our Creator God is holy, and He cannot dwell in the presence of sin because His holiness is a consuming fire to sin and anyone who cherishes it (Deuteronomy 4:24). In order to remove this barrier created by sin, God told Moses to build a sanctuary so He could again live with His people. His permanent presence in the sanctuary would be a source of comfort to the Israelites as He guided, protected, and provided for them in their journey through life. What did the sanctuary reveal? “Thy way, O God, is in the sanctuary: who is so great a God as our God?” —Psalm 77:13 The sanctuary reveals God’s way of dealing with sin and its consequences; it’s His marvelous plan of salvation, the good news, outlined in detail through a variety of symbols and ceremonies. What was the central concept taught by the sanctuary? “And almost all things are by the law purged with blood; and without shedding of blood is no remission.” —Hebrews 9:22 “For the life of the flesh is in the blood: and I have given it to you upon the altar to make an atonement for your souls: for it is the blood that maketh an atonement for the soul.” —Leviticus 17:11 The sanctuary service revolved around the sacrifice of animals, and this taught that blood, a symbol of life, had to be shed to obtain forgiveness of sin. But it wasn’t the blood of the sacrificed animals that provided forgiveness: theirs was merely a symbol that pointed to the only blood that could—the blood, and life, of the One who was sinned against. Jesus, the Creator of heaven and earth, is the Lamb of God slain from the foundation of the world (Revelation 13:8) who takes away my sins (John 1:29). The sanctuary thus provides a vivid portrayal of the high price of sin. It may seem insignificant to us, but sin ended up costing the very life Jesus, and if it wasn’t for His death on our behalf, it would’ve cost us our lives. Satan makes it look attractive, perhaps even life-giving at times, but the truth is sin always takes life away, while bringing pain, suffering, and, ultimately, death (Romans 6:23). Where did Moses get the sanctuary blueprint? “According to all that I shew thee, after the pattern of the tabernacle, and the pattern of all the instruments thereof, even so shall ye make it.” —Exodus 25:9 The blueprint for the sanctuary came from God Himself because, through it, He wanted to teach important lessons about the plan of salvation. Originally it was a portable, tent-like structure made of acacia wood, goat hair, animal skins, silver, and gold, consisting of three areas: the courtyard, the Holy Place, and the Most Holy Place. The courtyard, the area around the sanctuary, was 75 feet by 150 feet (Exodus 27:18) and fenced with linen cloth attached to 60 evenly spaced pillars of brass (Exodus 27:9-16). This perimiter had only one opening through which the sinner would enter the courtyard. Upon entry, the sinner would walk toward the altar of burnt offering (Exodus 40:6), where his or her animal sacrifice would be consumed by fire. Past the altar, but before the sanctuary entrance, was a laver (basin) for the priests to wash their hands and feet. The sanctuary itself was made up of two rooms, the Holy Place and the Most Holy Place, and the two were separated by a thick veil (curtain). The sanctuary walls were made of wooden boards overlaid in gold and set in silver sockets (Exodus 26:15-19, 29), while the roof consisted of four coverings: linen, goat hair, ram skin, and badger skin (Exodus 26:1, 7-14). Upon entry into the sanctuary, the first room was the Holy Place, containing a seven-branched candlestick that was kept burning at all times (Exodus 25:31-40), an altar of incense that was also kept consistently burning (Exodus 30:7-8), and a table of showbread with loaves of bread on it (Exodus 25:30; Leviticus 24:5-9). Past the thick veil was the Most Holy Place, the room where the presence of God resided. It contained the Ark of the Covenant (Exodus 40:3), which had the mercy seat on top of it and two angels, made of pure gold, on top of the mercy seat (Exodus 25:17-22). Inside the ark were the Ten Commandments written with the finger of God (Deuteronomy 10:4-5). Of what was the sanctuary a copy? “Now this is the main point of the things we are saying: We have such a High Priest, who is seated at the right hand of the throne of the Majesty in the heavens, a Minister of the sanctuary and of the true tabernacle which the Lord erected, and not man. For every high priest is appointed to offer both gifts and sacrifices. Therefore it is necessary that this One also have something to offer. For if He were on earth, He would not be a priest, since there are priests who offer the gifts according to the law; who serve the copy and shadow of the heavenly things, as Moses was divinely instructed when he was about to make the tabernacle. For He said, “See that you make all things according to the pattern shown you on the mountain.”” —Hebrews 8:1-5 The Hebrew sanctuary was a copy, a “shadow,” of the sanctuary in heaven of which Jesus is the High Priest, offering forgiveness of sins to the repenting sinner. In other words, God’s true sanctuary is the heavenly one, not the earthly one. How did a sinner receive forgiveness of sins? “And he shall lay his hand upon the head of the sin offering, and slay it for a sin offering in the place where they kill the burnt offering.” —Leviticus 4:33 A sinner would walk into the courtyard with a sacrificial lamb and approach the altar of burnt offering. Then he would confess his sins onto the lamb by placing his hand on its head (Leviticus 4:29; 5:5), symbolically transferring his sins to the lamb. Because the lamb was now symbolically guilty, it had to pay the penalty of sin—death, and the sinner would then slay the lamb with his own hand. Obviously, this was not an easy process, but it was intended to show the seriousness of sin. Afterward, the priest either ate part of the animal sacrifice (Leviticus 6:26) or sprinkled some of its blood inside the sanctuary (Leviticus 4:16-17), depending on the sacrifice offered. This meant the sin was then transferred from the lamb to the priest and then into the sanctuary, and the sinner walked away free from the penalty of sin. How do I receive forgiveness of sins? “The next day John seeth Jesus coming unto him, and saith, Behold the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the world.” —John 1:29 The animal sacrifices pointed to the Lamb of God sacrificed in the “courtyard” of this earth on the “altar” of a hill called Calvary. While the Hebrews were forgiven by looking forward, in faith, to the future sacrifice of Jesus, I am forgiven by looking backward, in faith, to what is now a completed sacrifice on the cross on my behalf. When Jesus died, the veil separating the Holy Place from the Most Holy Place in the earthly sanctuary was torn from top to bottom (Matthew 27:51), a divine indication that its services were obsolete from that moment on because the One true and great sacrifice they were all pointing to had been accomplished (Daniel 9:27). Any talk of building a new temple in Jerusalem to reinstitute those services is a denial of Jesus’ sacrificial death on behalf of and for all. What did the sanctuary furniture represent? Every piece of furniture points to Jesus and represents an aspect of His work on my behalf to save me from sin: - The altar of burnt offering represents the cross, while the animal represents Jesus, the ultimate sacrifice (John 1:29). - The laver points to Jesus as the Living Water cleansing me from sin and giving me a new birth through the Holy Spirit (John 4:10; Titus 3:5)—of which baptism is a symbol (Romans 6:3-7). - The candlestick points to Jesus as the Light of the world (John 1:9; 9:5), while its oil represents the Holy Spirit (Zechariah 4:1-6; Revelation 4:5), with whom I am invited to be filled (Luke 11:13). - The showbread is a symbol of Jesus being the Bread of Life (John 6:48, 51), which I an invited to internalize by reading His Word—the Bible (Matthew 4:4). - The altar of incense represents the righteousness of Jesus mixed with the prayers of God’s people (Revelation 5:8; 8:3). - The ark of the covenant represents God’s throne in heaven (Psalm 80:1), but there is more to it. Because God’s Ten Commandments were inside the ark, it shows how His law of love, which is a reflection of His character, is the foundation of His government. But since the mercy seat was over the Ten Commandments, it also represents His mercy being extended, through the blood that was sprinkled on the seat by the priest (Leviticus 16:15-16), to those who confess and forsake sin after breaking His law. It’s beautiful! And of course, the sprinkled blood was a symbol of Jesus’ blood shed on behalf of all people (Matthew 26:28). Do I have a High Priest today? “But Christ being come an high priest of good things to come, by a greater and more perfect tabernacle, not made with hands, that is to say, not of this building; neither by the blood of goats and calves, but by his own blood he entered in once into the holy place, having obtained eternal redemption for us.” —Hebrews 9:11-12 “For there is one God, and one mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus.” —1 Timothy 2:15 The sprinkling of blood by the priest foreshadowed Jesus’ current ministry in the heavenly sanctuary that He started after rising from the dead and returning to heaven. He is now my High Priest, presenting His own blood for my sins so they can be forgiven when I confess them in His name (1 John 1:9). In other words, the salvation process did not end at the cross but continues to this day in the heavenly sanctuary. Just like the priest was the mediator between God and sinners in the earthly sanctuary, Jesus is now our Mediator, the link between our human weakness and God’s divine power, reconciling us to God. What does this reconciliation entail? “Seeing then that we have a great high priest, that is passed into the heavens, Jesus the Son of God, let us hold fast our profession.” —Hebrews 4:14 “Wherefore he is able also to save them to the uttermost that come unto God by him, seeing he ever liveth to make intercession for them.” —Hebrews 7:25 “Being justified freely by his grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus: whom God hath set forth to be a propitiation through faith in his blood, to declare his righteousness for the remission of sins that are past, through the forbearance of God.” —Romans 3:24-25 “Who gave himself for us, that he might redeem us from all iniquity, and purify unto himself a peculiar people, zealous of good works.” —Titus 2:14 “For it is God which worketh in you both to will and to do of his good pleasure.” —Philippians 2:13 As my High Priest, Jesus accomplishes two amazing miracles when I genuinely confess my sins against Him and fully surrender my heart to Him: His perfect life is first imputed to me (I receive credit for it), allowing Him to wipe my sinful record clean, then its imparted to me (becomes a part of me) through a new birth, enabling me to live a life of victory in the present (John 3:3-6)! These two miracles make me righteous before God, which is something I can never accomplish through my own efforts (Acts 4:12). This is righteousness by faith—trusting my Savior to do for me and in me what I can never do for and in myself. What promises does God give regarding righteousness? There are several promises God gives me: - If I confess my sins, He will forgive them by ascribing Jesus’ sinless life and atoning death to me, thereby removing the death sentence from me and counting me as guiltless (1 John 1:9; Isaiah 1:18; 44:22; 2 Corinthians 5:21). - He promises to restore His image in me that was lost in Eden by giving me a new heart (Romans 8:29; Genesis 1:26-27; Ezekiel 36:25-27). - He promises to give me the desire and the power to live righteously (Philippians 2:13; Hebrews 13:20-21). - He will remain faithful to His work of restoring His image in me until I stand before His throne in heaven (Philippians 1:6; Jude 1:24). Do I have a role to play in this? “Not every one that saith unto me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of heaven; but he that doeth the will of my Father which is in heaven.” —Matthew 7:21 The promises mentioned above can become a reality only if I give Jesus the permission to perform them by making Him the Ruler of my life, and this commitment needs to be renewed every day (1 Corinthians 15:31; Luke 9:23) because He can continue His work in me only if I continue to cooperate with and remain fully surrendered to Him. This involves choosing to die to self daily because my carnal, selfish nature is naturally in enmity against God (Romans 8:5-9), but Jesus’ life was one of selflessness, so He calls me to follow Him (John 12:26; 1 Peter 2:21) even though the natural desire is to go my own way (Isaiah 53:6). He compares the surrender of self to getting an eye plucked out or a hand cut off (Matthew 5:29-30) because sin is addictive and selfishness is natural, but it can and will be overcome, by God’s power (Mark 10:26-27), in the lives of those whom Jesus calls His own. In another place, He compares His life of self denial to a narrow path (Matthew 7:13-14), so clearly this is not the path chosen by the majority. This is why a mere profession of faith in a life of conscious rebellion against His law is, ultimately, a shallow profession (1 John 2:3-6). Jesus shares heaven with those who share His selfless character, and this is a miracle only He can perform, but only if I give Him full control of my life (Matthew 19:27). What was the Day of Atonement? “Also on the tenth day of this seventh month there shall be a day of atonement: it shall be an holy convocation unto you; and ye shall afflict your souls, and offer an offering made by fire unto the LORD.” —Leviticus 23:27 The Day of Atonement (Yom Kippur) was a yearly occurance and the only time the High Priest entered the Most Holy Place. It was a solemn day of judgment, introspection, and repentance to ensure there was no unconfessed sin in one’s life. Anyone who refused to separate from sin was cut off from the camp of Israel (Leviticus 23:29). During this day the sanctuary was cleansed from the sins that had been trasferred there throughout the year because as the people offered sacrifices for sin, their sin was then symbolically transferred to the lamb, from the lamb to the priest, and, finally, from the priest to the sanctuary itself. How was the sanctuary cleansed? “And he shall take the two goats, and present them before the LORD at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation. And Aaron shall cast lots upon the two goats; one lot for the LORD, and the other lot for the scapegoat. And Aaron shall bring the goat upon which the LORD’S lot fell, and offer him for a sin offering. But the goat, on which the lot fell to be the scapegoat, shall be presented alive before the LORD, to make an atonement with him, and to let him go for a scapegoat into the wilderness.” —Leviticus 16:7-10 “And this shall be a statute for ever unto you: that in the seventh month, on the tenth day of the month, ye shall afflict your souls, and do no work at all, whether it be one of your own country, or a stranger that sojourneth among you: For on that day shall the priest make an atonement for you, to cleanse you, that ye may be clean from all your sins before the LORD.” —Leviticus 16:29-30 Once a year, on the Day of Atonement, two goats were selected. The Lord’s goat was killed as a sacrifice for the sins of God’s people (Leviticus 16:9), and the blood was taken by the high priest into the Most Holy Place and sprinkled upon and before the mercy seat (Leviticus 16:14). This represented the blood of Jesus and the mercy of God available to anyone who chooses to confess and forsake sin. God accepted the sprinkled blood, and the confessed sins of the people were then transferred from the sanctuary to the high priest, who then transferred them to the second goat—the scapegoat, which represented Satan (Leviticus 16:8). In this manner the sanctuary was cleansed from the sins of the people transferred there throughout the year (Leviticus 16:30). The scapegoat was then led into the wilderness (Leviticus 16:21-22) where it died, representing Satan’s punishment for the sins of the world because after Jesus’ Second Coming, Satan will be confined to the uninhabited, desolate wilderness of earth for 1,000 years (Revelation 20:1-3), and at the end of this period, he will perish in the lake of fire (Revelation 20:10). What did the Day of Atonement foreshadow? “It was therefore necessary that the patterns of things in the heavens should be purified with these; but the heavenly things themselves with better sacrifices than these.” —Hebrews 9:23 Since the earthly sanctuary and it’s services were a foreshadow of the heavenly sanctuary, the Day of Atonement was pointing to the cleansing of the heavenly sanctuary by the real High Priest, Jesus Christ, the real Mediator between God and man (1 Timothy 2:5) who offers forgiveness and cleansing from sin to anyone who exercises faith in His substitutionary sacrifice. In the broadest aspect, the Day of Atonement lead to sin being eradicated from the camp of Israel, which pointed to a future time when sin would be eradicated from the universe forever. Then and only then will the atonement be completed and the universe restored to its pre-sin state. The story of the sanctuary, therefore, is far reaching and all-encompassing, covering the entire history of the human race, from the fall of Adam and Eve in Eden to the restoration of the fallen race in the new heavenly Eden! What makes Jesus the perfect High Priest? “Therefore, in all things He had to be made like His brethren, that He might be a merciful and faithful High Priest in things pertaining to God, to make propitiation for the sins of the people. For in that He Himself has suffered, being tempted, He is able to aid those who are tempted.” —Hebrews 2:17-18, NKJV “For we do not have a High Priest who cannot sympathize with our weaknesses, but was in all points tempted as we are, yet without sin. Let us therefore come boldly to the throne of grace, that we may obtain mercy and find grace to help in time of need.” —Hebrews 4:15-16 Because Jesus was born in human flesh, He experienced all of the temptations that we experience, and because He knows what it feels like to wrestle with sin, He is full of mercy and compassion toward anyone who comes to Him in confession and repentence. Because He successfully resisted temptation (1 John 3:5) and gained victory over sin, He is ever ready to help me overcome sin in my own life. He wants me to experience an abundant life (John 10:10) that is free from the power of sin (John 8:31-31). The pain, misery, and suffering of sin was never a part of His plan for us. The human race brought it into the world, and the sanctuary shows that God takes it very seriously. His justice cannot excuse it, but, in His mercy, He also takes the burden of providing a way out of it entirely upon Himself, and He gives the remedy—freely—to anyone willing to take it. He is our merciful High Priest who shed His own blood so our record of sin could be blotted out. The only question is have you accepted His offer of mercy? Have your sins been covered by the blood of the Lamb?",

      "body": "What is the war of all wars? “To wit, that God was in Christ, reconciling the world unto himself, not imputing their trespasses unto them; and hath committed unto us the word of reconciliation.” —2 Corinthians 5:19 “Stand therefore, having your loins girt about with truth, and having on the breastplate of righteousness; and your feet shod with the preparation of the gospel of peace.” —Ephesians 6:14-15 Ever since Lucifer chose to exercise his freedom of choice to exalt self above God, the dissonant note of selfishness has marred the perfect harmony of God’s government. When Lucifer succeeded in infecting Adam and Eve with this virus of self-exaltation, a war began to rage in the heart of every human being between self and God. The way God has handled this rebellion against Himself and His legitimate authority, by risking everything in order to reconcile the human race back to Himself through the sacrifice of His only Son, Jesus Christ, has shone new light on the justice of His governemnt and the mercy of His character. After His ascension, Jesus committed this work of reconciliation, the proclamation of the gospel of peace, to His followers so that every human being would have the opportunity to be reconciled to God, because the truth is every person is at war with his or her Creator, knowingly or unknowingly, until the decision is made to surrender the fight. How do I know whom I serve? “Know ye not, that to whom ye yield yourselves servants to obey, his servants ye are to whom ye obey; whether of sin unto death, or of obedience unto righteousness?” —Romans 6:16 The Bible presents only two sides for us to choose from: God or Satan, good or evil, righteousness or sin, selflessness or selfishness, life or death. The side we yield, or surrender, to is the side we choose to serve. Our loving Father, Creator, and Reedemer invites us to surrender our will to Him moment by moment because His will for our lives is better, higher, and grander than our own (Isaiah 55:8-9). Did Jesus demonstrate this concept in His life? “And he went a little further, and fell on his face, and prayed, saying, O my Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me: nevertheless not as I will, but as thou wilt.” —Matthew 26:39 Just before His betrayal by Judas, Jesus went through the darkest time of His earthly life while He contemplated the events He had to soon pass through, but even though His humanity shrank from the suffering, humiliation, and the weight of sin He had to bear for every human being, He chose to follow the will of His Father rather than His own. In doing so, He opened the door of blessing, reconciliation, and salvation to every member of the human family. How does Paul describe our human condition? “For I know that in me (that is, in my flesh,) dwelleth no good thing: for to will is present with me; but how to perform that which is good I find not. For the good that I would I do not: but the evil which I would not, that I do.” —Romans 7:18-19 Our fallen human nature makes it natural for us to live for self rather than for God. We may have the desire to live for God but fall short in our ability to do it. Is there a solution? “But thanks be to God, which giveth us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ.” —1 Corinthians 15:57 “For we ourselves also were sometimes foolish, disobedient, deceived, serving divers lusts and pleasures, living in malice and envy, hateful, and hating one another. But after that the kindness and love of God our Saviour toward man appeared, not by works of righteousness which we have done, but according to his mercy he saved us, by the washing of regeneration, and renewing of the Holy Ghost; which he shed on us abundantly through Jesus Christ our Saviour; that being justified by his grace, we should be made heirs according to the hope of eternal life.” —Titus 3:3-7 “For if ye live after the flesh, ye shall die: but if ye through the Spirit do mortify the deeds of the body, ye shall live.” —Romans 8:13 The good news is Jesus Christ, through the regenerating, renewing power of the Holy Spirit, gives us the ability to experience victory in the battle against self, allowing us to live in harmony with the will of God! What does this look like in practice? “There is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit.” —Romans 8:1 “This I say then, Walk in the Spirit, and ye shall not fulfil the lust of the flesh. For the flesh lusteth against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh: and these are contrary the one to the other: so that ye cannot do the things that ye would. But if ye be led of the Spirit, ye are not under the law.” —Galatians 5:16-18 Every day we make a choice whether we are guided by our own desires and inclinations (the flesh) or by the Spirit of God. We receive freedom from the slavery of selfishness and sinfulness only when we choose to walk in the Spirit, being guided by it moment by moment. When this happens, we give God permission to carry out His will in our lives. What metaphor did Paul use to describe this? “I am crucified with Christ: nevertheless I live; yet not I, but Christ liveth in me: and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God, who loved me, and gave himself for me.” —Galatians 2:20 “But God forbid that I should glory, save in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom the world is crucified unto me, and I unto the world.” —Galatians 6:14 “And they that are Christ’s have crucified the flesh with the affections and lusts.” —Galatians 5:24 We begin walking in the Spirit when we choose to surrender to God, which Paul describes as a crucifixion of, or death to, self. Putting away self, which is in conflict with the Spirit, allows Christ to live His life in us by faith, and we then become a new creation in Jesus (2 Corinthians 5:17)! What is a symbol of this death? “Know ye not, that so many of us as were baptized into Jesus Christ were baptized into his death? Therefore we are buried with him by baptism into death: that like as Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the Father, even so we also should walk in newness of life. For if we have been planted together in the likeness of his death, we shall be also in the likeness of his resurrection: knowing this, that our old man is crucified with him, that the body of sin might be destroyed, that henceforth we should not serve sin. For he that is dead is freed from sin.” —Romans 6:3-7 The decision to give our life over to Jesus is synonymous we the decision to die to self because that is the only way He can reign on the throne of our heart. Baptism is a beautiful symbol of this burial of self, along with the old life of sin, demonstrated by the submersion into water, and of the resurrection from that burial to a new life in Jesus, demonstrated by the coming out of water. Is death to self a one-time occurance? “And he said to them all, If any man will come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross daily, and follow me.” —Luke 9:23 “I protest by your rejoicing which I have in Christ Jesus our Lord, I die daily.” —1 Corinthians 15:31 Jesus says that those who desire to follow Him will make a daily decision to deny self. Paul echoes this when he says that death to self is a daily occurance for him, not a one-time experience, because it is the consistent connection with Christ that recreates His character in His people. What is the process of growth compared to? “For the earth bringeth forth fruit of herself; first the blade, then the ear, after that the full corn in the ear.” —Mark 4:28 Growing in Christ is the work of a lifetime, and it’s truly His work, made possible by a daily surrender to Him. As long as we continue to cooperate with God, He will continue to grow us in grace, leading us into a deeper relationship with Him as He molds our characters to more accurately reflect His own. Receiving the righteous, loving character of Jesus is the greatest privilege and honor of every human being. What is God’s reaction when I fall short? “For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God.” —Romans 3:23 “For a just man falleth seven times, and riseth up again: but the wicked shall fall into mischief.” —Proverbs 24:16 “My little children, these things write I unto you, that ye sin not. And if any man sin, we have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous: and he is the propitiation for our sins: and not for ours only, but also for the sins of the whole world.” —1 John 2:1-2 God is gracious and merciful; He does not give up on us when we make mistakes! He is always willing to forgive the repentant person, and Jesus Christ, our Advocate in heaven, is ready to cover our shortcomings with His own righteousness, pleading His own blood on our behalf, when we genuinely repent of our sins. When learning to walk it’s not unusual for a child to fall down, but problems arise when the child stops getting up. Such a state of discouragement is Satan’s ultimate goal. But God is a patient, loving parent, who stoops down to meet us where we are, always ready to lift us back up if we stretch out our hand to Him (Micah 7:7-8). Of course, we don’t want to abuse His grace and become presumptuous by choosing to cling to sin, because the wages of sin is death (Romans 3:23). Sin is so serious that the Father had to give up His own Son to a death on the cross because of it. The repentant sinner who truly loves Jesus and appreciates His sacrifice will develop a hatred of sin. What takes place in a fully surrendered life? “For it is God which worketh in you both to will and to do of his good pleasure.” —Philippians 2:13 “Know ye not, that to whom ye yield yourselves servants to obey, his servants ye are to whom ye obey; whether of sin unto death, or of obedience unto righteousness?” —Romans 6:16 When we yield ourselves to Christ, He starts living and working in us, giving us both the willingness and the ability to do His will. This is the gospel, the good news of forgiveness, cleansing, and restoration that Jesus has made freely available to anyone who asks for it! If Jesus could restore the demoniac (Mark 5:1-15), He can restore anybody from the most hopeless circumstances. How does Jesus live in us? “And I will pray the Father, and he shall give you another Comforter, that he may abide with you for ever; even the Spirit of truth; whom the world cannot receive, because it seeth him not, neither knoweth him: but ye know him; for he dwelleth with you, and shall be in you. I will not leave you comfortless: I will come to you.” —John 14:16-18 “Finally, my brethren, be strong in the Lord, and in the power of his might. Put on the whole armour of God, that ye may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil.” —Ephesians 6:10-11 When Jesus talked about His Father sending the Holy Spirit, He equated the Spirit with His own presence because He said “I will come to you.” We’ve already learned that we have victory over self through Jesus Christ, and now we know He dwells in us through the gift of the Holy Spirit. So it is His power and His armor, not our own, that makes us strong, enabling us to live a life that’s pleasing to Him. How can I receive the gift of the Holy Spirit? “Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and ye shall find; knock, and it shall be opened unto you.” —Matthew 7:7 “If ye then, being evil, know how to give good gifts unto your children: how much more shall your heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to them that ask him?” —Luke 11:13 God is with us, not against us; He wants us to succeed in our Christian walk. His great desire is to give His Spirit to all who recognize their need of Divine help. We just have to ask! What is God after? “And be not conformed to this world: but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind, that ye may prove what is that good, and acceptable, and perfect, will of God.” —Romans 12:2 “Then will I sprinkle clean water upon you, and ye shall be clean: from all your filthiness, and from all your idols, will I cleanse you. A new heart also will I give you, and a new spirit will I put within you: and I will take away the stony heart out of your flesh, and I will give you an heart of flesh. And I will put my spirit within you, and cause you to walk in my statutes, and ye shall keep my judgments, and do them.” —Ezekiel 36:25-27 The transformation of character—the renewal of mind and the purifying of heart—is what God is after. He cannot do this without our cooperation, without a total surrender of our will to Him, but to those who ask Him to take their life as they cling to His promise and power to transform, Jesus gives the same assurance He gave to the suffering woman, “be of good comfort: thy faith hath made thee whole” (Luke 8:48). What other promises do we have? “Being confident of this very thing, that he which hath begun a good work in you will perform it until the day of Jesus Christ.” —Philippians 1:6 “Now unto him that is able to keep you from falling, and to present you faultless before the presence of his glory with exceeding joy, to the only wise God our Saviour, be glory and majesty, dominion and power, both now and ever. Amen.” —Jude 1:24-25 “And the very God of peace sanctify you wholly; and I pray God your whole spirit and soul and body be preserved blameless unto the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ. Faithful is he that calleth you, who also will do it.” —1 Thessalonians 5:23-24 As long as we continue to choose Christ daily, we are complete in Him (Colossians 2:10), who gives us help and power, who has promised to perform the work He has begun in our hearts, and to present us faultless before His glory! What is the plan of salvation really about? “And they shall see his face; and his name shall be in their foreheads.” —Revelation 22:4 “And the LORD descended in the cloud, and stood with him there, and proclaimed the name of the LORD. And the LORD passed by before him, and proclaimed, The LORD, The LORD God, merciful and gracious, longsuffering, and abundant in goodness and truth, keeping mercy for thousands, forgiving iniquity and transgression and sin, and that will by no means clear the guilty; visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children, and upon the children’s children, unto the third and to the fourth generation.” —Exodus 34:5-7 “Let this mind be in you, which was also in Christ Jesus.” —Philippians 2:5 Salvation goes beyond justification by faith in Jesus and includes sanctification, also by faith (1 Corinthians 6:9-11). Yes, it’s about the gift of eternal life (John 3:16), but it’s also about total freedom from the degrading power of sin, total restoration of the image of God in fallen humanity. Following Christ goes beyond the knowledge of, and belief in, truth as revealed in His Word. Christianity is the complete, total surrender to the will of God, so that He can write His name—the attributes of His character—on our foreheads, a symbol for our mind. Fallen humanity redeemed to reflect the beauty of God’s character is the great aim of the plan of redemption (2 Peter 1:4). What an honor!",

      "body": "What is God’s will regarding sin? “But your iniquities have separated between you and your God, and your sins have hid his face from you, that he will not hear.” —Isaiah 59:2 “And she shall bring forth a son, and thou shalt call his name JESUS: for he shall save his people from their sins.” —Matthew 1:21 “If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.” —1 John 1:9 “Who his own self bare our sins in his own body on the tree, that we, being dead to sins, should live unto righteousness: by whose stripes ye were healed.” —1 Peter 2:24 Before sin entered the world, Adam and Eve communicated with God face to face. Once they allowed sin to enter their hearts, it separated them from their Creator because sin cannot exist in the presence of a holy God—His presence is a consuming fire to those who cherish sin (Deuteronomy 4:24). The Father then sent His Son not only to pay the penalty for sin on our behalf, but also to save us from our sins. He wants to forgive and cleanse us from any and all unrighteousness so that we may be dead to sin and alive to righteousness! What is the first step to victory over sin? “And if it seem evil unto you to serve the LORD, choose you this day whom ye will serve; whether the gods which your fathers served that were on the other side of the flood, or the gods of the Amorites, in whose land ye dwell: but as for me and my house, we will serve the LORD.” —Joshua 24:15 Sin is a choice, an act of the will because the devil cannot force anyone to sin. I get to choose whom I will serve every single day. Now it’s true that will power without God is my own power, but an act of the will is the first step on the road to victory. Sin can be defeated only if I cooperate with God; He will do for me what I cannot do for myself, but I need to do my part by making a firm choice to serve Him. Jesus raised Lazarus from the dead, but He didn’t roll away the stone because people were capable of doing that themselves. There is also a huge difference between desiring to overcome and choosing to overcome. God is powerless to help me until I make that choice, so whenever temptation comes, my first response can be “No, I choose to serve Christ.” What is the second step? “But thanks be to God, which giveth us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ.” —1 Corinthians 15:57 “And Jesus answering saith unto them, Have faith in God. For verily I say unto you, That whosoever shall say unto this mountain, Be thou removed, and be thou cast into the sea; and shall not doubt in his heart, but shall believe that those things which he saith shall come to pass; he shall have whatsoever he saith. Therefore I say unto you, What things soever ye desire, when ye pray, believe that ye receive them, and ye shall have them.” —Mark 11:22-24 “And this is the confidence that we have in him, that, if we ask any thing according to his will, he heareth us. And if we know that he hear us, whatsoever we ask, we know that we have the petitions that we desired of him.” —1 John 5:14-15 The Bible is clear that it’s God will for me to have victory over sin. The Bible also says anything that I ask in faith according to His will He will do, and Paul even encourages me to thank God for the victory He gives me through Jesus. Just like the Israelites gave a loud shout of victory before the walls of Jericho came down (Joshua 6:16), I can claim that victory by faith and thank God for it. Faith in the power of God is crucial; it is the difference between merely asking for victory and believing it. The victory is a gift that needs to be received and accepted. So after saying “No, I choose to serve Christ,” my second response to temptation can be “Thank you God for the victory that is mine through Jesus.” What is the third step? “Likewise reckon ye also yourselves to be dead indeed unto sin, but alive unto God through Jesus Christ our Lord. Let not sin therefore reign in your mortal body, that ye should obey it in the lusts thereof. Neither yield ye your members as instruments of unrighteousness unto sin: but yield yourselves unto God, as those that are alive from the dead, and your members as instruments of righteousness unto God. For sin shall not have dominion over you.” —Romans 6:11-14 Through the righteousness of Jesus and the power of the Holy Spirit in me I can be dead to sin. Temptation has no power over a corpse, and I can be just as dead to it. After thanking God for the victory, I can follow it up with “I am dead to this sin.” And remember, dying to sin is not divorcing a best friend, but an evil enemy. It is a cause for joy and celebration! So do not crawl, but run from it like Joseph did (Genesis 39:12). Is it smart to dwell on the temptation? “Blessed is the man that endureth temptation: for when he is tried, he shall receive the crown of life, which the Lord hath promised to them that love him. Let no man say when he is tempted, I am tempted of God: for God cannot be tempted with evil, neither tempteth he any man: but every man is tempted, when he is drawn away of his own lust, and enticed. Then when lust hath conceived, it bringeth forth sin: and sin, when it is finished, bringeth forth death.” —James 1:12-15 “Wherefore gird up the loins of your mind, be sober, and hope to the end for the grace that is to be brought unto you at the revelation of Jesus Christ.” —1 Peter 1:13 “Casting down imaginations, and every high thing that exalteth itself against the knowledge of God, and bringing into captivity every thought to the obedience of Christ.” —2 Corinthians 10:5 “For as he thinks in his heart, so is he.” —Proverns 23:7 Sin occurs when the door of the mind is opened, and it’s then let inside and entertained. Temptation becomes sin when it’s cherished in the mind and, in the words of James, allowed to conceive sin. Peter calls us to bind the mind, like a soldier binds his belt in preparation for action, so the mind is ready to deal with temptation. Paul tells us to bring every thought into captivity to Christ since a sinful thought immediately rejected does not have strength. The faster I turn to God the safer I am, and the more I do it the easier it gets. How did Jesus meet temptation? “And when the tempter came to him, he said, If thou be the Son of God, command that these stones be made bread. But he answered and said, It is written, Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God.” —Matthew 4:3-4 “For the word of God is living and powerful, and sharper than any two-edged sword, piercing even to the division of soul and spirit, and of joints and marrow, and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart.” —Hebrews 4:12, NKJV “Your word I have hidden in my heart, that I might not sin against You.” —Psalm 119:11 “But we all, with open face beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord, are changed into the same image from glory to glory, even as by the Spirit of the Lord.” —2 Corinthians 3:18 Jesus met temptation by quoting Scripture. Hebrews tells us the Bible is alive, powerful, and sharper than any sword. When I store His word in my mind by reading it daily and memorizing favorite passages, I am “girding” up my mind. Furthermore, I become what I behold, so by beholding the character of Christ as revealed in His word, my character will be transformed to reflect His character through the work of the Holy Spirit. The next time temptation comes, let’s follow the example of our Redeemer and turn to the Bible to give us victory! How can I reduce temptation? “But put ye on the Lord Jesus Christ, and make not provision for the flesh, to fulfil the lusts thereof.” —Romans 13:14 “This I say then, Walk in the Spirit, and ye shall not fulfil the lust of the flesh.” —Galatians 5:16 “Commit thy works unto the LORD, and thy thoughts shall be established.” —Proverbs 16:3 “And if thy right hand offend thee, cut it off, and cast it from thee: for it is profitable for thee that one of thy members should perish, and not that thy whole body should be cast into hell.” —Matthew 5:30 The Bible invites me to “put on Christ” and “walk in the Spirit.” I do this by beginning every day sitting at His feet, like Mary did (Luke 10:39), reading His Word and asking Him to convert my heart and mind. Then I commit my will to Him for that day. And then I “make no provision for the flesh” by removing myself from temptation and doing all that I can to create an environment that is free from it. When I leave room for temptation I am telling myself I will fail, so throw it out, pour it out, delete the app, cancel the subscription, cut the cable. What is God’s promise? “There hath no temptation taken you but such as is common to man: but God is faithful, who will not suffer you to be tempted above that ye are able; but will with the temptation also make a way to escape, that ye may be able to bear it.” —1 Corinthians 10:13 We saw in James 1:12 that God does not tempt anyone, but now we have a promise that He will not allow us to be tested beyond what we are able to bear! He provides a way of escape for every temptation the devil throws at us! What if I’ve struggled with the same sin for years? “For the weapons of our warfare are not carnal, but mighty through God to the pulling down of strong holds.” —2 Corinthians 10:4 “I can do all things through Christ which strengtheneth me.” —Philippians 4:13 “For a righteous person falls seven times and rises again, but the wicked stumble in time of disaster.” —Proverbs 24:16 “And he arose, and came to his father. But when he was yet a great way off, his father saw him, and had compassion, and ran, and fell on his neck, and kissed him. And the son said unto him, Father, I have sinned against heaven, and in thy sight, and am no more worthy to be called thy son. But the father said to his servants, Bring forth the best robe, and put it on him; and put a ring on his hand, and shoes on his feet: and bring hither the fatted calf, and kill it; and let us eat, and be merry: for this my son was dead, and is alive again; he was lost, and is found. And they began to be merry.” —Luke 15:20-24 The walls of Jericho seemed insurmountable, and they were, as far as human strength was concerned (Numbers 13:28), but then the God of the universe got involved, and they crumbled like sand. The walls of sin in our lives are the same until we ask God to get involved and intervene on our behalf, and the promise is that Jesus Christ is mighty to pull them down! It’s not about how many times I’ve fallen, but whether I got up and went to the Father who is waiting for me with outstretched arms. I can never think of yourself as a hopeless case; it’s not from God. My past history is not my legacy or destiny. It’s not “I’d like to be an overcomer,” or “I hope to be.” Through the grace and power of Christ in my life I am an overcomer! What is the most powerful motivation for overcoming sin? “For the preaching of the cross is to them that perish foolishness; but unto us which are saved it is the power of God.” —1 Corinthians 1:18 “That Christ may dwell in your hearts by faith; that ye, being rooted and grounded in love, may be able to comprehend with all saints what is the breadth, and length, and depth, and height; and to know the love of Christ, which passeth knowledge, that ye might be filled with all the fulness of God.” —Ephesians 3:17-19 “We love him, because he first loved us.” —1 John 4:19 The more time I spend thinking about what Jesus did for me on the cross, the more my love for Him will grow and my abhorence for sin will increase. Sin is so evil that it required the Son of God to leave the courts of heaven, take on human nature, live a perfect life while assailed by the devil on every side, and die the death of the worse criminal on the cross because the Creator God was the only One who could pay the penalty for my sins. Let’s get grounded in the love of Christ as revealed on the cross, so it becomes the driving motivation for victory over sin. The more I love Him the more I’ll hate those things that separate me from Him and are repulsive to His character. What does Revelation say about those who overcome? “And they overcame him by the blood of the Lamb, and by the word of their testimony; and they loved not their lives unto the death.” —Revelation 12:11 “To him that overcometh will I grant to sit with me on my throne, even as I also overcame, and am set down with my Father on his throne.” —Revelation 3:21 “The four and twenty elders fall down before him that sat on the throne, and worship him that liveth for ever and ever, and cast their crowns before the throne, saying, Thou art worthy, O Lord, to receive glory and honour and power: for thou hast created all things, and for thy pleasure they are and were created.” —Revelation 4:10-11 There is power in what Jesus did on the cross because Revelation says the saints overcame Satan by the blood of Jesus Christ. He gives them the victory, and then He grants them to sit on His throne! This is an echo of how the Father treated His prodigal son. Such treatment is completely undeserved, but He does it anyway out of His immeasurable love for His children. No wonder the saints in heaven will cast their crowns before His throne in worship and adoration saying that He is worthy to receive glory, honor, and power. What can I pray for on a daily basis? “Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done on earth, as it is in heaven.” —Matthew 6:10",

      "body": "What does Daniel see coming up out of the sea? “In the first year of Belshazzar king of Babylon Daniel had a dream and visions of his head upon his bed: then he wrote the dream, and told the sum of the matters. Daniel spake and said, I saw in my vision by night, and, behold, the four winds of the heaven strove upon the great sea. And four great beasts came up from the sea, diverse one from another.” —Daniel 7:1-3 What is a beast in Bible prophecy? “Thus he said, The fourth beast shall be the fourth kingdom upon earth, which shall be diverse from all kingdoms, and shall devour the whole earth, and shall tread it down, and break it in pieces.” —Daniel 7:23 Beasts in Bible prophecy represent earthly kingdoms, and they are a fitting symbol because throughout history, these kingdoms have been distinguished by cruelty, force, and oppression. In contrast, Revelation portrays king Jesus as a Lamb (Revelation 5:13; 12:11; 17:14) because He is guided by love and gentleness. Instead of imposing His will by force, He stands at the door of the heart and knocks (Revelation 3:20), waiting to be let inside. What does the sea represent? “And he saith unto me, The waters which thou sawest, where the whore sitteth, are peoples, and multitudes, and nations, and tongues.” —Revelation 17:15 The sea represents densely populated areas. What was the first beast Daniel saw? “The first was like a lion, and had eagle’s wings: I beheld till the wings thereof were plucked, and it was lifted up from the earth, and made stand upon the feet as a man, and a man’s heart was given to it.” —Daniel 7:4 “The king of Babylon hath heard the report of them, and his hands waxed feeble: anguish took hold of him, and pangs as of a woman in travail. Behold, he shall come up like a lion from the swelling of Jordan unto the habitation of the strong: but I will make them suddenly run away from her: and who is a chosen man, that I may appoint over her? for who is like me? and who will appoint me the time? and who is that shepherd that will stand before me?” —Jeremiah 50:43-44 The first beast coming up out of the sea was like a lion, which represented the kingdom of Babylon. In Daniel 2, the first kingdom represented by the head of gold was also Babylon. The Bible operates on the principle of repetition where previously covered subjects are repeated and new details added, and so Daniel 7 covers the same kingdoms as Daniel 2, but adds more details to each. What was the second beast? “And behold another beast, a second, like to a bear, and it raised up itself on one side, and it had three ribs in the mouth of it between the teeth of it: and they said thus unto it, Arise, devour much flesh.” —Daniel 7:5 Babylon was eventually conquered by Medo-Persia, which is symbolized by a bear raised up on one side because this second empire was made up of two groups of people—the Medes, who came up first, and the Persians, who eventually became stronger. The three ribs in the mouth of the bear represent the three main powers conquered by Medo-Persia: Lydia, Babylon, and Egypt. By the way, in Daniel 8:3 Medo-Persia is symbolized by a ram with two-horns, but one of them was higher than the other and came up last; then in Daniel 8:20 this empire is called by name. What was the third beast? “After this I beheld, and lo another, like a leopard, which had upon the back of it four wings of a fowl; the beast had also four heads; and dominion was given to it.” —Daniel 7:6 The Medo-Persian empire was then conquered by Greece, which is symbolized by a leopard with four wings and four heads. Wings in the Bible represent speed (Jeremiah 4:11-13), and the four wings are a fitting representation for the speed with which Alexander the Great conquered. The four heads represent the four kingdoms into which the empire was divided when Alexanded died. What was the fourth beast? “After this I saw in the night visions, and behold a fourth beast, dreadful and terrible, and strong exceedingly; and it had great iron teeth: it devoured and brake in pieces, and stamped the residue with the feet of it: and it was diverse from all the beasts that were before it; and it had ten horns.” —Daniel 7:7 “And the ten horns out of this kingdom are ten kings that shall arise: and another shall rise after them; and he shall be diverse from the first, and he shall subdue three kings.” —Daniel 7:24 Greece was eventually conquered by the Roman Empire, which is symbolized by the fourth beast with 10 horns. The 10 horns represent the 10 kingdoms into which Rome was eventually split by the barbarian tribes: Visigoths (Spain), Anglo-Saxons (England), Franks (France), Alemani (Germany), Burgundians (Switzerland), Lombards (Italy), Suevi (Portugal), Heruli, Ostrogoths, and Vandals. These are the same kingdoms that were represented by the ten toes of the image in Daniel 2:41-44. What happens next? “I considered the horns, and, behold, there came up among them another little horn, before whom there were three of the first horns plucked up by the roots: and, behold, in this horn were eyes like the eyes of man, and a mouth speaking great things.” —Daniel 7:8 Another power appears symbolized by a little horn. We will see that all of the characteristics that the Bible gives it clearly identify it as the antichrist, which is defined in one of two ways: opposition to Christ or acting in place of Christ. What characteristics does this little horn power have? “After this I saw in the night visions, and behold a fourth beast, dreadful and terrible, and strong exceedingly; and it had great iron teeth: it devoured and brake in pieces, and stamped the residue with the feet of it: and it was diverse from all the beasts that were before it; and it had ten horns. I considered the horns, and, behold, there came up among them another little horn, before whom there were three of the first horns plucked up by the roots: and, behold, in this horn were eyes like the eyes of man, and a mouth speaking great things.” —Daniel 7:7-8 “I beheld, and the same horn made war with the saints, and prevailed against them.” —Daniel 7:21 “And the ten horns out of this kingdom are ten kings that shall arise: and another shall rise after them; and he shall be diverse from the first, and he shall subdue three kings. And he shall speak great words against the most High, and shall wear out the saints of the most High, and think to change times and laws: and they shall be given into his hand until a time and times and the dividing of time.” —Daniel 7:24-25 The Bible gives nine clear characteristics to identify the antichrist: 1. the little horn would come up somewhere amomg the 10 kingdoms of Western Europe (Daniel 7:8), 1. It would have a man at its head speaking for it (Daniel 7:8), 1. It would uproot three kingdoms (Daniel 7:8), 1. It would emerge from the fourth kingdom—the pagan Roman Empire (Daniel 7:7-8), 1. It would make war with the saints (Daniel 7:21), 1. It would be different from the 10 other kingdoms (Daniel 7:24), 1. It would persecute the saints for “a time and times and the dividing of time” (Daniel 7:25), 1. It would “speak great words against” (blaspheme) God (Daniel 7:25), 1. It would attempt “to change times and laws” (Daniel 7:25). What power fits these characteristics? Historians would be able to quickly identify the power being described because there is only one that fits them all—the papacy. Now it is important to emphasize that this is not a condemnation of Roman Catholics; rather, the Bible is pointing out a system—Catholicism. In other places the Bible also points out the faults of the Jewish and Protestant faiths. Moreover, God has devoted Christians in all churches, including the Roman Catholic church. It is also true that the papacy has done many good deeds for the poor and the needy, but she has also committed serious errors that the Bible clearly points out in Daniel and in Revelation. God must sometimes chasten and rebuke because He wants us to be aware of error and compromise, and people who are truly loyal to Him will heed His warnings, no matter the faith. With this in mind, let’s examine each of the nine characteristics: 1. It came up among the 10 kingdoms of Western Europe. The papal power is in the heart of Western Europe in Rome, Italy. 1. It would have a man at its head speaking for it. The papacy has the pope at its head who speaks for it. 1. It would uproot three kingdoms. Most of the 10 kingdoms of Western Europe supported the papacy, but three of them did not: the Heruli, the Ostrogoths, and the Vandals. These had to be destroyed before the papacy could rise to power. The Heruli were eradicated in 493, the Vandals in 534, and the power of the Ostrogoths was curtailed in 538. 1. It would emerge from the fourth kingdom—the pagan Roman Empire. The papacy is a continuation of the pagan Roman Empire, and historians attest to this. “The mighty Catholic Church was little more than the Roman Empire baptized. … The very capital of the old Roman Empire became the capital of the Christian empire. The office of Pontifex Maximus was continued in that of the pope.” “Whatever Roman elements the barbarians and Arians left … [came] under the protection of the Bishop of Rome, who was the chief person there after the emperor’s disappearance. … The Roman church … pushed itself into the place of the Roman World-Empire, of which it is the actual continuation.” 1. It would make war with the saints. It is no secret that the Roman Catholic church killed millions of people whose religious convictions differed from hers, especially during the Dark Ages. “That the Church of Rome has shed more innocent blood than any other institution that has ever existed among mankind, will be questioned by no Protestant who has a competent knowledge of history.” 1. It would be different from the 10 other kingdoms. The papacy is different from the other secular powers in Europe in that it rose to power as a religious power. 1. It would persecute the saints for “a time and times and the dividing of time.” In the Bible a time is a year, times is two years, and half a time is half of a year, so this is a total of three and a half years. The Amplified Bible actually translates it as “three and one-half years.” This same period is also mentioned as 42 months in Revelation 11:2; 13:5, as well as 1,260 days in Revelation 11:3; 12:6, 14 (the Jewish calendar is 30 days). In the Bible one prophetic day equals one literal year (Ezekiel 4:6; Numbers 14:34), so the little horn would have power to persecute the saints for 1,260 years. The papacy gained this power in 538 when the Ostrogoths, the last of the opposing kingdoms, were uprooted, and it ruled until 1798 when Napoleon’s general, Berthier, took the pope captive. Thus, its 1,260 year rule from 538 to 1798 is a direct fulfillment of this prophecy. Matthew 24:21-22 mentions this period of persecution against the saints, saying no soul would have survived it if God did not shorten it, but He did shorten it, and the persecution ended well before 1798. 1. It would “speak great words against” (blaspheme) God. Daniel 7:25 (“speak great words against the most High”) is echoed by Revelation 13:5 (“speaking great things and blasphemies”), so speaking great words is equivalent to blasphemy, which has two definitions in the Bible: claiming to forgive sins (Luke 5:21), and claiming to be God (John 10:33). The papacy claims both of these things. “Does the Priest truly forgive the sins, or does he only declare that they are remitted? The Priest does really and truly forgive the sins in virtue of the power given to him by Christ.” “We [the popes] hold upon this earth the place of God Almighty.” “The pope is not only the representative of Jesus Christ, but he is Jesus Christ, Himself, hidden under the veil of flesh.” 1. It would attempt “to change times and laws.” This is a reference to the law of God, and there is only one commandment that is both a time and a law: the fourth commandment about keeping the seventh day Sabbath holy. Furthermore, there is also only one Lawgiver (James 4:12), the Creator of heaven and earth, and no one can actually change the law of God (Luke 16:17), but the papacy has thought to transfer the Sabbath from Saturday to Sunday, the first day of the week. In its catechisms, it has also removed the second commandment against the veneration of images, shortened the fourth commandment, and divided the tenth commandment into two. In other words, there are now two apparent lawgivers, with two different days of worship, but only one of them is legitimate—the seventh-day Sabbath of the Almighty God. There is no other organization but the papacy that fits all nine of the characteristics of the little horn power of Daniel 7. And this is not a new idea either because every Protestant reformer believed the papacy was the antichrist. Alexander Clarence Flick, The Rise of the Medieval Church, 148, 149.

Aren’t there many antichrists? “Little children, it is the last time: and as ye have heard that antichrist shall come, even now are there many antichrists; whereby we know that it is the last time. They went out from us, but they were not of us; for if they had been of us, they would no doubt have continued with us: but they went out, that they might be made manifest that they were not all of us. But ye have an unction from the Holy One, and ye know all things. I have not written unto you because ye know not the truth, but because ye know it, and that no lie is of the truth. Who is a liar but he that denieth that Jesus is the Christ? He is antichrist, that denieth the Father and the Son.” —1 John 2:18-22 It’s true that through out history many antichrists have worked against God, but there is only one entity, the papacy, that fulfills the traits of the little horn power, which makes the following claim, “we declare, we proclaim, we define that it is absolutely necessary for salvation that every human creature be subject to the Roman Pontiff,” despite the fact that salvation is a gift, by grace through faith (Ephesians 2:8-9). Some may expect the antichrist to openly oppose God, but the word “antichrist” has two meanings: opposition to Christ or acting in place of Christ. Ultimately, both actions seek to supplant God’s position and authority, which is a continuation of Satan’s original aim in heaven. Satan’s work of deception in the last days is much more effective when the antichrist appears spiritual and holy, but God, in His love, gave the prophecies of Daniel and Revelation to expose these deceptions so that people are not mislead. Many will follow antichrist (Revelation 13:3) thinking they are following Jesus, but those who test every teaching by the Bible (Isaiah 8:20) will follow the Lamb (Revelation 14:4). Unam Sanctum: Pope Boniface VIII: 1302 What should I do when encountering new teachings? “These were more noble than those in Thessalonica, in that they received the word with all readiness of mind, and searched the scriptures daily, whether those things were so.” —Acts 17:11 “To the law and to the testimony: if they speak not according to this word, it is because there is no light in them.” —Isaiah 8:20 When encountering a new teaching it’s crucial not to take someone else’s word, but to study the topic for myself to see if it’s in harmony with the Bible. What promise does Revelation give? “And they overcame him by the blood of the Lamb, and by the word of their testimony; and they loved not their lives unto the death.” —Revelation 12:11 “Abide in me, and I in you. As the branch cannot bear fruit of itself, except it abide in the vine; no more can ye, except ye abide in me. I am the vine, ye are the branches: He that abideth in me, and I in him, the same bringeth forth much fruit: for without me ye can do nothing.” —John 15:4-5 “Then spake Jesus again unto them, saying, I am the light of the world: he that followeth me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life.” —John 15:4-5 The good news is Satan is a defeated foe. Jesus has already won the battle between good and evil on the cross, and those who overcome Satan in the last days will do it only by the grace and power of Jesus in their lives. Jesus is the Light, and it is my privilege to know and follow Him by daily reading His love letter to me—the Bible; it will illuminate my path and expose darkness because Jesus does not want anyone to be deceived.",

And the LORD came down to see the city and the tower, which the children of men builded. And the LORD said, Behold, the people is one, and they have all one language; and this they begin to do: and now nothing will be restrained from them, which they have imagined to do. Go to, let us go down, and there confound their language, that they may not understand one another’s speech. So the LORD scattered them abroad from thence upon the face of all the earth: and they left off to build the city. Therefore is the name of it called Babel; because the LORD did there confound the language of all the earth: and from thence did the LORD scatter them abroad upon the face of all the earth.” —Genesis 11:4-9 “The king spake, and said, Is not this great Babylon, that I have built for the house of the kingdom by the might of my power, and for the honour of my majesty?” —Daniel 4:30 The word “Babylon” originated at the Tower of Babel because it was the place where God confounded language, leading to confusion and bringing construction to a halt. “Babylon” and “Babel” both mean “confusion.” Later on in the 600s BC, the pagan kingdom of Babylon arose and developed into an economic and religious center of the world. Its religion was characterized by idolatry, ancestor worship, and sun worship, and it became an enemy of God’s people, Israel (Jeremiah 39:6-7; 50:29-34; 51:34). Babylon was also marked by a boastful and prideful spirit, as seen in the Babylonian king’s boastful remark in Daniel 4:30. In fact, in Isaiah 14:4-22, God uses Babylon as a symbol of Satan due to its pride and wickedness. What kind of legacy did ancient Babylon leave behind? “Babylon hath been a golden cup in the LORD’s hand, that made all the earth drunken: the nations have drunken of her wine; therefore the nations are mad. Babylon is suddenly fallen and destroyed: howl for her; take balm for her pain, if so be she may be healed.” —Jeremiah 51:7-8 “Then they brought the golden vessels that were taken out of the temple of the house of God which was at Jerusalem; and the king, and his princes, his wives, and his concubines, drank in them. They drank wine, and praised the gods of gold, and of silver, of brass, of iron, of wood, and of stone.” —Daniel 5:3-4 Because of its power and influence in the world, Babylon made drunk, or confused, the nations of the world with its false pagan teachings, and due to its refusal to turn from its wickedness, idolatry, and persecution of God’s people, God allowed it to be destroyed (Daniel 4:30; Jeremiah 51:24, 47) by the Medo-Persians. On the night of its fall, the king of Babylon threw a party, during which he desecrated the holy vessels stolen from the temple of God in Jerusalem by drinking wine out of them and using them for the unholy worship of false gods. He ended up perishing that very night (Daniel 5:30). The Bible makes it clear in Isaiah 13:19-20 that ancient Babylon would never be rebuilt or inhabited again, so the Babylon of the book of Revelation is not a literal Babylon, but a spiritual one. How does Revelation describe Babylon? “And there came one of the seven angels which had the seven vials, and talked with me, saying unto me, Come hither; I will shew unto thee the judgment of the great whore that sitteth upon many waters: With whom the kings of the earth have committed fornication, and the inhabitants of the earth have been made drunk with the wine of her fornication. So he carried me away in the spirit into the wilderness: and I saw a woman sit upon a scarlet coloured beast, full of names of blasphemy, having seven heads and ten horns. And the woman was arrayed in purple and scarlet colour, and decked with gold and precious stones and pearls, having a golden cup in her hand full of abominations and filthiness of her fornication: And upon her forehead was a name written, MYSTERY, BABYLON THE GREAT, THE MOTHER OF HARLOTS AND ABOMINATIONS OF THE EARTH. And I saw the woman drunken with the blood of the saints, and with the blood of the martyrs of Jesus: and when I saw her, I wondered with great admiration.” —Revelation 17:1-6 “And the woman which thou sawest is that great city, which reigneth over the kings of the earth.” —Revelation 17:18 The Bible gives seven characteristics to describe Babylon: 1. She is called the “Mother of Harlots” (Revelation 17:5), 2. She persecutes the saints (Revelation 17:6), 3. She is dressed in purple and scarlet and decked with jewelry (Revelation 17:4), 4. She is sitting on a beast (Revelation 17:3), 5. She has worldwide influence (Revelation 17:1, 18), 6. The beast she’s sitting on has seven heads and ten horns (Revelation 17:3), 7. The beast is guilty of blasphemy (Revelation 17:3). What does a woman represent? “I have likened the daughter of Zion to a comely and delicate woman.” —Jeremiah 6:2 “And I have put my words in thy mouth, and I have covered thee in the shadow of mine hand, that I may plant the heavens, and lay the foundations of the earth, and say unto Zion, Thou art my people.” —Isaiah 51:16 “For this cause shall a man leave his father and mother, and shall be joined unto his wife, and they two shall be one flesh. This is a great mystery: but I speak concerning Christ and the church. Nevertheless let every one of you in particular so love his wife even as himself; and the wife see that she reverence her husband.” —Ephesians 5:31-33 “Let us be glad and rejoice, and give honour to him: for the marriage of the Lamb is come, and his wife hath made herself ready. And to her was granted that she should be arrayed in fine linen, clean and white: for the fine linen is the righteousness of saints.” —Revelation 19:7-8 “Son of man, cause Jerusalem to know her abominations … But thou didst trust in thine own beauty, and playedst the harlot because of thy renown, and pouredst out thy fornications on every one that passed by; his it was.” —Ezekiel 16:2, 15 In the Bible a woman represents the church. A pure woman is a pure church that is faithful to Jesus, while an impure woman, or a harlot, is an unfaithful, or fallen, church. In Revelation 19:7-8 the true church is portrayed as Christ’s bride, and her members are covered by and reflect the righteousness of Jesus. Who does the harlot represent? The Bible gives seven characteristics to identify the harlot of Revelation 17 as the papacy. Now it’s important to emphasize that this is not a condemnation of Roman Catholics; rather, the Bible is pointing out a system—Catholicism. In other places the Bible also points out the faults of the Jewish and Protestant faiths. Moreover, God has devoted Christians in all churches, including the Roman Catholic church. It is also true that the papacy has done many good deeds for the poor and the needy, but she has also committed serious errors that the Bible clearly points out in Daniel and in Revelation. God must sometimes chasten and rebuke because He wants us to be aware of error and compromise, and people who are truly loyal to Him will heed His warnings, no matter the faith. With this in mind, let’s examine each of the seven characteristics. 1. She is called the “Mother of Harlots.” There is only one church that calls itself the mother church—the Roman Catholic Church. A prominent Catholic priest has made the following point: “They [non-Catholics] have continued the custom [of Sunday-keeping], even though it rests upon the authority of the Catholic Church and not upon an explicit text in the Bible. That observance [Sunday-keeping] remains as a reminder of the Mother Church from which the non-Catholic sects broke away—like a boy running away from home but still carrying in his pocket a picture of his mother or a lock of her hair.” 1. She persecutes the saints. The papacy persecuted and killed millions of people during the Dark Ages for following their conscience. 1. She is dressed in purple and scarlet and decked with jewelry. The colors listed match those of papal vestments. Red is the robe color worn by Catholic cardinals, and purple is the color of royalty, often worn by the pope at significant events since he is considered to be Christ’s representative on earth. Revelation 18:7 confirms this when it says that Babylon considers herself a queen. She is also decked with gold, precious stones, and pearls, all of which point to great wealth, which can be seen in her ornate and extravagant cathedrals. The golden cup in her hand looks impressive on the outside, but the inside is full of abominations—or false teachings based on human tradition, which is elevated above the Bible. 1. She is sitting on a beast. A beast represents a kingdom or nation (Daniel 7:23), so the fact that she is sitting on the beast represents not just the union of church and state (though they remain separate entities), but power over the state and its policies. This was fulfilled in the Dark Ages when the papacy united with, and exercised power over, the state to implement her policies and persecute people who disagreed with her teachings. This will be repeated again in the last days. 1. She has worldwide influence. Her influence is not limited to just one civil government. Her sitting on many waters (Revelation 17:1, 15), which represent people and nations, shows her influence and power over them, and Revelation 17:18 confirms this again by saying that she reigns “over the kings of the earth.” The papacy fulfills this point too. According to historian Alexander Flick, by the 13th century the pope was “at least in theory … the ruler of the whole world in temporal and spiritual affairs.” 1. The beast she’s sitting on has seven heads and ten horns. The seven heads are seven mountains (Revelation 17:9), and Rome, the headquarters of the papacy, is known, and has been referred to by classical writers, as the City of Seven Hills. The ten horns represent the ten barbarian tribes that arose after the fall of the Roman Empire. 1. The beast is guilty of blasphemy. Blasphemy has two definitions in the Bible: claiming to forgive sins (Luke 5:21), and claiming to be God (John 10:33). The papacy is a continuation of the pagan Roman Empire, and just like the Roman emperors claimed to be gods, the popes claim to be the Vicars of Christ. There is no other earthly power that fulfills all of these characteristics. Many leaders of the Reformation, including Huss, Wycliffe, Luther, Calvin, Zwingli, Melanchthon, Cranmer, Tyndale, Latimer, and Ridley, also agreed that the power described here is the papacy.

George Eldon Ladd, The Blessed Hope (Grand Rapids, MI: William B. Eerdman’s Publishing Co., 1956), pp. 32-34. Who are the harlot daughters? “And upon her forehead was a name written, MYSTERY, BABYLON THE GREAT, THE MOTHER OF HARLOTS AND ABOMINATIONS OF THE EARTH.” —Revelation 17:5 “Ye therefore, beloved, seeing ye know these things before, beware lest ye also, being led away with the error of the wicked, fall from your own stedfastness. But grow in grace, and in the knowledge of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ. To him be glory both now and for ever.” —2 Peter 3:17-18 “Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.” —John 14:6 Just as the harlot represents a fallen church, her daughters also represent fallen churches. Since the mother, just like ancient Babylon, has confused the world with her teachings, these daughter churches follow and teach the same key errors as the mother church. No woman, however, is born a harlot. These harlot daughters were originally undefiled and separate from the mother when during the great Protestant Reformation they protested her unbiblical teachings, but slowly, over time, they began to come back to her in acknowledgment of her authority and in agreement with her key teachings. This has led to them becoming fallen themselves and a part of spiritual Babylon. Peter uses the word “fallen” as another term to describe a turning away from truth and choosing to be led by error instead. He contrasts this with growing in grace and the knowledge of Jesus, which means that, ultimately, a fallen church turns her back on Jesus Himself because He is the truth. What is Babylon guilty of? “With whom the kings of the earth have committed fornication, and the inhabitants of the earth have been made drunk with the wine of her fornication.” —Revelation 17:2 “Ye adulterers and adulteresses, know ye not that the friendship of the world is enmity with God? whosoever therefore will be a friend of the world is the enemy of God.” —James 4:4 James describes spiritual adultery as a union with the world, and Revelation clearly shows that spiritual Babylon develops partnerships with earthly kings and uses the ways of the world (coercion) to win people to her side. We’ve already seen how the papacy united with the state in the Dark Ages to persecute, torture, and kill millions of people. God prohibits such a union because He never uses coercive measures to draw people to Himself; instead, He respectfully knocks at the door of the heart (Revelation 3:20) because He respects freedom of choice and wants people to follow Him out of love. He does not need the state to help bring people into His church; His love alone is powerful enough! The true church is loyal to Jesus only, but the papacy has turned away from her husband, Jesus, and formed illicit relationships with the state instead. What does this union lead to? “And an host was given him against the daily sacrifice by reason of transgression, and it cast down the truth to the ground; and it practised, and prospered.” —Daniel 8:12 “And the woman was arrayed in purple and scarlet colour, and decked with gold and precious stones and pearls, having a golden cup in her hand full of abominations and filthiness of her fornication.” —Revelation 17:4 “For all nations have drunk of the wine of the wrath of her fornication, and the kings of the earth have committed fornication with her, and the merchants of the earth are waxed rich through the abundance of her delicacies. … And they cast dust on their heads, and cried, weeping and wailing, saying, Alas, alas, that great city, wherein were made rich all that had ships in the sea by reason of her costliness! for in one hour is she made desolate.” —Revelation 18:3, 19 Whenever a church unites with the world, it results in a turning away from Bible truth. In Daniel 8:9-12 the little horn of Daniel 7:8, representing the papacy, is mentioned again, and the text says it casts truth to the ground and prospers. As the papacy replaced Bible truth with its own tradition and pagan teachings, it opened up the way to practices, like the selling of indulgences, that allowed it to acquire incredible wealth. In Revelation 18:11-13 this is confirmed when she’s mentioned as trafficking in the “souls of men” or, in other words, treating people as merchandise. No wonder she is decked with all kinds of expensive jewelry and holds a golden cup in Revelation 17:4. The next chapter then talks about ships in the sea and merchants being made rich because of her—a reference to economic advantages that lead to prosperity through some form of a partnership or alliance with her. Could this apply to large, global corporations, for example? What other powers are part of Babylon? “And I saw three unclean spirits like frogs come out of the mouth of the dragon, and out of the mouth of the beast, and out of the mouth of the false prophet. For they are the spirits of devils, working miracles, which go forth unto the kings of the earth and of the whole world, to gather them to the battle of that great day of God Almighty.” —Revelation 16:13-14 “And after these things I saw another angel come down from heaven, having great power; and the earth was lightened with his glory. And he cried mightily with a strong voice, saying, Babylon the great is fallen, is fallen, and is become the habitation of devils, and the hold of every foul spirit, and a cage of every unclean and hateful bird. For all nations have drunk of the wine of the wrath of her fornication, and the kings of the earth have committed fornication with her, and the merchants of the earth are waxed rich through the abundance of her delicacies.” —Revelation 18:1-3 There are three powers that come together: the dragon, the beast, and the false prophet. Revelation 12:9 tells us the dragon represents Satan working through pagan Rome when it tried to destroy Jesus at His birth (Revelation 12:4). Satan is also called the prince of this world in John 12:31, and his influence expands beyond pagan Rome. He has used ancient Egypt, Assyria, and Babylon to persecute God’s people, and we’ve learned he will use the U.S.A. and the papacy in the future. Because Revelation 13:8 says all the world will worship the beast in the last days, other world governments will be used too, as well as non-Christian religions, such as Islam, Buddhism, Hinduism, the New Age, etc. The second power, the beast, represents the papacy and the false prophet represents the apostate Protestantism of America. And so world governments and non-Christian religions, Roman Catholicism, and apostate Protestantism will form an alliance, called “Babylon the great” in Revelation 18:2, in the final battle against God, His followers, and His law. Note how the three powers of Revelation 16:13 are associated with unclean spirits, and Babylon is said to be the “hold of every foul spirit” in Revelation 18:2. What will unite these powers? “And I saw three unclean spirits like frogs come out of the mouth of the dragon, and out of the mouth of the beast, and out of the mouth of the false prophet. For they are the spirits of devils, working miracles, which go forth unto the kings of the earth and of the whole world, to gather them to the battle of that great day of God Almighty.” —Revelation 16:13-14 “And the light of a candle shall shine no more at all in thee; and the voice of the bridegroom and of the bride shall be heard no more at all in thee: for thy merchants were the great men of the earth; for by thy sorceries were all nations deceived.” —Revelation 18:23 “For there shall arise false Christs, and false prophets, and shall shew great signs and wonders; insomuch that, if it were possible, they shall deceive the very elect.” —Matthew 24:24 “Now the Spirit speaketh expressly, that in the latter times some shall depart from the faith, giving heed to seducing spirits, and doctrines of devils; speaking lies in hypocrisy; having their conscience seared with a hot iron.” —1 Timothy 4:1-2 “For such are false apostles, deceitful workers, transforming themselves into the apostles of Christ. And no marvel; for Satan himself is transformed into an angel of light.” —2 Corinthians 11:13-14 What the three powers of Revelation 16:13 have in common are the unclean spirits that come out of their mouths, and according to Revelation 16:14, these are spirits of devils working through miracles and sorcery. This is an echo of Christ’s warning about false Christs and false prophets working miracles, which means we can expect a counterfeit religious revival, supported by miracles, sorcery, and spiritism, just before Christ’s coming. Spiritism, a doctrine of Satan first introduced in Eden when he told Eve she would “not surely die” (Genesis 3:4), is the belief that the dead are alive and can contact the living. Incidentally, Catholicism prays to Mary and other dead saints; apostate Protestantism also believes the dead are not really dead but alive in heaven or hell; and non-Christian religions have a door open to spiritism through practices like “channeling” and spirit worship. And so when Satan and his angels pose as dead loves ones, prophets of old, angels of heaven, or even Christ Himself, while quoting a twisted version of the Scriptures, the deception will be overwhelming to anyone whose faith is not based on the Bible. What did ancient Babylon believe about death? “Then he brought me to the door of the gate of the LORD’S house which was toward the north; and, behold, there sat women weeping for Tammuz.” —Ezekiel 8:14 Tamuz was the god of food and vegetation worshiped by the Babylonians, who believed that he died each year when winter arrived but would be resurrected in the spring (immortality of the soul), and so every year his death was mourned. But it wasn’t just Tamuz; they also believed that people went on to exist in another form after death, which led the Babylonians to worship the dead. This teaching, that people continue to live or be conscious after death, has survived and been adopted by spiritual Babylon, and her influence has made it spread to many Christian churches even though the Bible preaches the exact opposite (Ecclesiastes 9:5; Psalm 115:17). What else did ancient Babylon believe? “Therefore, behold, the days come, that I will do judgment upon the graven images of Babylon: and her whole land shall be confounded, and all her slain shall fall in the midst of her.” —Jeremiah 51:47 “And he brought me into the inner court of the LORD’S house, and, behold, at the door of the temple of the LORD, between the porch and the altar, were about five and twenty men, with their backs toward the temple of the LORD, and their faces toward the east; and they worshipped the sun toward the east.” —Ezekiel 8:16 The worship of graven images was also a practice of ancient Babylonians that has been adopted by spiritual Babylon even though God clearly forbids it in the second commandment (Exodus 20:4-6). Ancient Babylonians practiced sun worship too, and it managed to corrupt some of God’s very own people. The practice has been adopted by spiritual Babylon through the keeping of Sunday—the day of the sun—as the day of worship instead of the seventh-day Sabbath as outlined in the fourth commandment (Exodus 20:8-11). Many are unaware of the pagan origin of Sunday-keeping, which is why God has a message for the last days calling people to worship Him according to His commandments. Incidentally, the false teaching that the law of God has been changed or repealed is also propogated by spiritual Babylon even though the Bible clearly teaches the law cannot be changed (Luke 16:17). One other particularly destructive pagan teaching that has caused many people to turn away from God is the belief that sinners burn eternally in hell—an echo of Satan’s original “you shall not surely die” lie in Eden and a contradiction of God’s Word (Genesis 2:17; 3:4). What is God’s message to people in Babylon? “Flee out of the midst of Babylon, and deliver every man his soul: be not cut off in her iniquity; for this is the time of the LORD’S vengeance; he will render unto her a recompence.” —Jeremiah 51:6 “And after these things I saw another angel come down from heaven, having great power; and the earth was lightened with his glory. And he cried mightily with a strong voice, saying, Babylon the great is fallen, is fallen, and is become the habitation of devils, and the hold of every foul spirit, and a cage of every unclean and hateful bird. For all nations have drunk of the wine of the wrath of her fornication, and the kings of the earth have committed fornication with her, and the merchants of the earth are waxed rich through the abundance of her delicacies. And I heard another voice from heaven, saying, Come out of her, my people, that ye be not partakers of her sins, and that ye receive not of her plagues. For her sins have reached unto heaven, and God hath remembered her iniquities.” —Revelation 18:1-5 “And other sheep I have, which are not of this fold: them also I must bring, and they shall hear my voice; and there shall be one fold, and one shepherd.” —John 10:16 The false teachings previously mentioned are some of the key doctrines, the wine, through which spiritual Babylon makes all nations of the world drunk (Revelation 17:2; 18:3). This wine disorients, confuses, and leads to spiritual drunkenness. And it’s based on lies, which are a type of abomination in the Bible (Proverbs 12:22). Just like God called Israel out of ancient Babylon, He is calling His people out of spiritual Babylon before it’s destroyed because He knows He has sincere Christians there who have not heard this warning yet. When they hear His call, Jesus says they will heed His voice and follow Him. How did Jesus unmask Satan’s lies in the wilderness? “But he answered and said, It is written, Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God. … Jesus said unto him, It is written again, Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God. … Then saith Jesus unto him, Get thee hence, Satan: for it is written, Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and him only shalt thou serve.” —Matthew 4:4, 7, 10 “To the law and to the testimony: if they speak not according to this word, it is because there is no light in them.” —Isaiah 8:20 Jesus’ answer to every deception Satan threw at Him was to quote the Bible. (Note that Satan quoted the Bible too, but he twisted it for his own purposes.) Studying and memorizing Scripture is the only effective strategy to resist Satan’s deceptions in these last days, because he will twist the Bible again. After all, his persuasive logic managed to deceieve a third of the angels in heaven (Revelation 12:4) and almost the entire population (minus eight people) at the time of the Flood. How will God unmask Satan’s deceptions in the last days? “And after these things I saw another angel come down from heaven, having great power; and the earth was lightened with his glory.” —Revelation 18:1 “And this gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a witness unto all nations; and then shall the end come.” —Matthew 24:14 In the Bible, angels symbolize messengers or messages. Because God wants everyone to come to the knowledge of the truth so that they can be saved (1 Timothy 2:3-4), He will have a remnant people, portrayed in the three angels’ messages of Revelation 14:6-14, who will stand for Bible truth and expose the false gospel of Babylon (Galatians 1:8-12), calling people to worship and obey Him, not only in spirit but also in truth. God’s message of truth will be so powerful that it will illuminate the whole world with His glory, so that every person, instead of being deceived, will be well-informed when making a decision regarding who to worship. Am I lost if I’m currently in Babylon? “And the times of this ignorance God winked at; but now commandeth all men every where to repent.” —Acts 17:30 Absolutely not. This is made clear in God’s call to “Come out of her, my people,” meaning there are sincere people in Babylon whom God calls His children. Not knowing certain Bible teachings does not mean a person is lost or not a child of God as He does not hold me accountable for truths I don’t know, but once I know the truth, God calls me out of error to stand on the Bible alone. Can I stay in Babylon in order to reform her? “And I heard another voice from heaven, saying, Come out of her, my people, that ye be not partakers of her sins, and that ye receive not of her plagues. … Therefore shall her plagues come in one day, death, and mourning, and famine; and she shall be utterly burned with fire: for strong is the Lord God who judgeth her.” —Revelation 18:4, 8 “Whosoever committeth sin transgresseth also the law: for sin is the transgression of the law.” —1 John 3:4 Babylon has become hopelessly drunk with her false doctrines and traditions, which have resulted in her sinning against God (breaking His law), and Jesus says she’s going to be destroyed, not reformed. There may be pressure from other people to stay in Babylon, but remaining in a system that teaches errors is spiritually dangerous; ultimately, it’s Jesus’ opinion that matters most. When Paul was under immense pressure from religious leaders to compromise with error, He answered, “We ought to obey God rather than men” (Acts 5:29). Though it may seem difficult, it’s the right thing to do. If this is you, ask God for guidance as you seek His will and search the Scriptures (Acts 17:11). Promise Him that you will follow wherever He leads, and His promise to you is He will lead you to the truth (John 7:17), which will set you free (John 17:17). When Jesus has your heart, He will give all the grace you need to follow Him (Philippians 4:13).",

      "body": "Who is the source of truth? “Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.” —John 14:6 “Sanctify them through thy truth: thy word is truth.” —John 17:17 “And ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free.” —John 8:32 “Through thy precepts I get understanding: therefore I hate every false way. Thy word is a lamp unto my feet, and a light unto my path.” —Psalm 119:104-105 Jesus is truth, and His Word to us, the Bible, is truth. It’s the Light that illuminates the path of life, that exposes the various lies of the world, and any message that is contrary to it is not from God. The truth of Jesus has the power to sanctify and set me free from deception and sin, but this also means that lies have the power to corrupt and bring me into bondage. What warning did Jesus give about rejecting truth? “And with all deceivableness of unrighteousness in them that perish; because they received not the love of the truth, that they might be saved. And for this cause God shall send them strong delusion, that they should believe a lie, that they all might be damned who believed not the truth, but had pleasure in unrighteousness.” —2 Thessalonians 2:10-12 The rejection of truth opens oneself up to deception, delusion, and the accepting of lies. Does God have a people who believe the truth? “But if I tarry long, that thou mayest know how thou oughtest to behave thyself in the house of God, which is the church of the living God, the pillar and ground of the truth.” —1 Timothy 3:15 Jesus began His work with His disciples; they were the beginning of His church. After He ascended to heaven, His disciples went about preaching the good news of the gospel with power, expanding His church in all directions. Ever since, Jesus has always had a people, His church, who have believed the truth as it was taught by Him. What is the history of God’s church? “And I saw when the Lamb opened one of the seals, and I heard, as it were the noise of thunder, one of the four beasts saying, Come and see. And I saw, and behold a white horse: and he that sat on him had a bow; and a crown was given unto him: and he went forth conquering, and to conquer. And when he had opened the second seal, I heard the second beast say, Come and see. And there went out another horse that was red: and power was given to him that sat thereon to take peace from the earth, and that they should kill one another: and there was given unto him a great sword. ““And when he had opened the third seal, I heard the third beast say, Come and see. And I beheld, and lo a black horse; and he that sat on him had a pair of balances in his hand. And I heard a voice in the midst of the four beasts say, A measure of wheat for a penny, and three measures of barley for a penny; and see thou hurt not the oil and the wine. And when he had opened the fourth seal, I heard the voice of the fourth beast say, Come and see. And I looked, and behold a pale horse: and his name that sat on him was Death, and Hell followed with him. And power was given unto them over the fourth part of the earth, to kill with sword, and with hunger, and with death, and with the beasts of the earth.” —Revelation 6:1-8 Revelation 6 outlines the history of God’s church with four symbolic horses. In Zechariah 6:1-8 there is a similar vision with four chariots of two horses, and when Zechariah asks the angel what they represent he is told they are essentially messengers that go out. The number four, on the other hand, represents the four corners of the earth (Revelation 7:1; Matthew 24:31), so the four horses in Revelation 6 refer to the spread of the church, and more specifically, the phases that God’s church goes through as it spreads Jesus’ gospel message to the whole world. - White horse: The church began with the white horse, which is a symbol of purity (Psalm 51:7; Isaiah 1:18). This period began with the ascension of Jesus in A.D. 31 and lasted until the death of the last apostle in A.D. 100. The conquering of this horse refers to spiritual conquest, conquering falsehood with the arrows of truth (symbolized by the rider’s bow), and this the church did very well because after the Holy Spirit was poured out during Pentecost (Acts 2:1-4), the gospel message went out to the entire then-known world (Colossians 1:23). - Red horse: The second horse is red, a symbol of blood (2 Kings 3:22), and in this context it represents persecution, which lasted from A.D. 100 to A.D. 313. The success of the apostolic church did not go unnoticed, so Satan used the Roman Empire to start persecuting God’s people (symbolized by the rider’s great sword); nevertheless, the church continued to grow during this time (Romans 8:35-39). - Black horse: The third horse is black, and since it’s the opposite of white (purity), it represents corruption. This period lasted from A.D. 313 to A.D. 538. It was a time when Christianity was accepted by the state, which led to the introduction of various false, pagan doctrines and practices that ended up corrupting the church. The pair of scales in the rider’s hand represent judgment (Daniel 5:24-28). - Pale horse: The fourth and final horse is pale (near death), and the rider is called Death. This can only point to the period of the Dark Ages when Satan tried to extinguish the truths taught by Jesus and recorded in His Word (Acts 20:28-30; 2 Thessalonians 2:1-10). This phase spans from A.D. 538 to 1517—the start of the Reformation. What else does the Bible say about this last period? “And an host was given him against the daily sacrifice by reason of transgression, and it cast down the truth to the ground; and it practised, and prospered.” —Daniel 8:12 “Let no man deceive you by any means: for that day shall not come, except there come a falling away first, and that man of sin be revealed, the son of perdition; who opposeth and exalteth himself above all that is called God, or that is worshipped; so that he as God sitteth in the temple of God, shewing himself that he is God.” —2 Thessalonians 2:3-7 “Beloved, when I gave all diligence to write unto you of the common salvation, it was needful for me to write unto you, and exhort you that ye should earnestly contend for the faith which was once delivered unto the saints. For there are certain men crept in unawares, who were before of old ordained to this condemnation, ungodly men, turning the grace of our God into lasciviousness, and denying the only Lord God, and our Lord Jesus Christ.” —Jude 1:3-4 Daniel predicted a time when truth would be cast down, and Paul wrote about a falling away that would occur before the second coming of Christ, marked by a religious system rising up that would oppose and exalt itself above God Himself. This was also echoed by Jude, who encouraged his readers to contend earnestly for the unadulterated faith of the apostolic church. God used the Reformation movement to restore a lot of the truths that were cast to the ground, but this warfare against biblical truth has not ceased. The words of Paul and Jude are as relevant today as they were during the Dark Ages. What did Jesus warn about in the last days? “For there shall arise false Christs, and false prophets, and shall shew great signs and wonders<; insomuch that, if it were possible, they shall deceive the very elect.” —Matthew 24:24 “Put not your trust in princes, nor in the son of man, in whom there is no help.” —Psalm 146:3 “Look unto me, and be ye saved, all the ends of the earth: for I am God, and there is none else.” —Isaiah 45:22 Jesus warned about false prophets arising in the last days whose aim would be to deceive people, which brings us to the first identifying characteristic of a cult: it has one powerful human leader. This is dangerous because Jesus never taught His disciples to establish a hierarchy; on the contrary, He taught about humility and self-sacrifice in service to others (Matthew 20:25-28), and so the apostles saw themselves as fellow workers with others (Philemon 1:24). The Bible is very clear that we are not to put our trust in fallible human leaders, but to look to God, who alone can save us. What is another identifying mark of a cult? “Howbeit in vain do they worship me, teaching for doctrines the commandments of men.” —Mark 7:7 The second characteristic of a cult is the leader’s teachings cannot be questioned; they essentially become absolute truth even if they go against the teachings of the Bible, thus elevating them, and their leader, above the Bible. Jesus knew this would happen and clearly warned against it. What is the third identifier? “For do I now persuade men, or God? or do I seek to please men? for if I yet pleased men, I should not be the servant of Christ.” —Galatians 1:10 “You shall not follow the crowd in doing evil, nor shall you testify in a dispute so as to join together with a crowd in order to pervert justice.” —Exodus 23:2, NASB Cults will often pressure their members in order to coerce them into submission. This was the tactic the religious leaders used to coerce Pilate to crucify our Lord (Matthew 27:24) even though he was convinced Jesus was innocent. When there is a conflict between the demands of human beings and the will of Jesus as revealed in His Word, loyalty to Christ always takes precedence. What is the fourth identifying mark? “Beloved, when I gave all diligence to write unto you of the common salvation, it was needful for me to write unto you, and exhort you that ye should earnestly contend for the faith which was once delivered unto the saints. For there are certain men crept in unawares, who were before of old ordained to this condemnation, ungodly men, turning the grace of our God into lasciviousness, and denying the only Lord God, and our Lord Jesus Christ.” —Colossians 2:8-9 “Beware lest any man spoil you through philosophy and vain deceit, after the tradition of men, after the rudiments of the world, and not after Christ. For in him dwelleth all the fulness of the Godhead bodily.” —Colossians 2:8-9 The fourth identifier of cults is their denial that Jesus is the divine Son of God—a central truth of the plan of salvation. The Bible plainly teaches that salvation is a gift from God (Ephesians 2:8) since God the Father gave His Son (John 3:16), and God the Son gave Himself, of His own free will (John 10:17-18), on the cross for humanity. Incidentally, this denial of Christ’s divinity is almost a necessity as it opens the way for a human being to become the cult’s Messiah-like leader. What is the final identifier? “And the woman which hath an husband that believeth not, and if he be pleased to dwell with her, let her not leave him. For the unbelieving husband is sanctified by the wife, and the unbelieving wife is sanctified by the husband: else were your children unclean; but now are they holy.” —1 Corinthians 7:13-14 Cults will often pressure their followers to leave their families because such separation makes it possible to have more control over their followers. The Bible does not teach this. Paul says that, if possible, a believing wife should not separate from an unbelieving husband. Jesus, too, after healing the demoniac, told him to go home to his friends to share what He had done for him even though the man wanted to follow Jesus (Mark 5:18-20). Instead of leaving his family and friends, Jesus wanted him to first reach them with the good news of the gospel! What counsel did Jesus give about the light of His truth? “Then Jesus said unto them, Yet a little while is the light with you. Walk while ye have the light, lest darkness come upon you: for he that walketh in darkness knoweth not whither he goeth. While ye have light, believe in the light, that ye may be the children of light.” —John 12:35-36 “To the law and to the testimony: if they speak not according to this word, it is because there is no light in them.” —Isaiah 8:20 The Bible is the great Light (Psalm 119:105), which we have the privilege of following while walking through life, and those who do this become the children of light. The Light prevents us from being deceived by lies that can only lead to darkness and bondage. Isaiah invites us to test every teaching with God’s Word. Is it in harmony with the Bible? If not, it is not from God. Will there be people loyal to God in the last days? “And the dragon was wroth with the woman, and went to make war with the remnant of her seed, which keep the commandments of God, and have the testimony of Jesus Christ.” —Revelation 12:17 “Here is the patience of the saints: here are they that keep the commandments of God, and the faith of Jesus.” —Revelation 14:12 God has always had a people who cling to biblical truth, refusing to compromise with man-made traditions, and this will be the case in the last days too, when God will have loyal followers who keep the faith and the testimony of Jesus, including His Ten Commandments. Will the truth ever be conquered by darkness? “And this gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a witness unto all nations; and then shall the end come.” —Matthew 24:14 “And I saw another angel fly in the midst of heaven, having the everlasting gospel to preach unto them that dwell on the earth, and to every nation, and kindred, and tongue, and people, saying with a loud voice, Fear God, and give glory to him; for the hour of his judgment is come: and worship him that made heaven, and earth, and the sea, and the fountains of waters.” —Revelation 14:6-7 God still had a people during the Dark Ages, like the Waldenses, Albigenses, and Huguenots, who faithfully preserved and followed the truth of His Word, which earned them only a life of relentless persecution, but this did not move them (Acts 20:23-24) because they counted the truth of God’s Word more precious than life itself. When the Reformation began, the truth was unshackled and made even more accessible to the masses. Now with modern technologies like the radio, television, and the internet, the gospel is being, and will continue to be, preached all over the world until everyone has heard the good news of Jesus Christ’s love!",

      "body": "How does the story start? “And in the second year of the reign of Nebuchadnezzar Nebuchadnezzar dreamed dreams, wherewith his spirit was troubled, and his sleep brake from him. Then the king commanded to call the magicians, and the astrologers, and the sorcerers, and the Chaldeans, for to shew the king his dreams. So they came and stood before the king. And the king said unto them, I have dreamed a dream, and my spirit was troubled to know the dream. Then spake the Chaldeans to the king in Syriack, O king, live for ever: tell thy servants the dream, and we will shew the interpretation. ““The king answered and said to the Chaldeans, The thing is gone from me: if ye will not make known unto me the dream, with the interpretation thereof, ye shall be cut in pieces, and your houses shall be made a dunghill. But if ye shew the dream, and the interpretation thereof, ye shall receive of me gifts and rewards and great honour: therefore shew me the dream, and the interpretation thereof. They answered again and said, Let the king tell his servants the dream, and we will shew the interpretation of it. ““The king answered and said, I know of certainty that ye would gain the time, because ye see the thing is gone from me. But if ye will not make known unto me the dream, there is but one decree for you: for ye have prepared lying and corrupt words to speak before me, till the time be changed: therefore tell me the dream, and I shall know that ye can shew me the interpretation thereof. ““The Chaldeans answered before the king, and said, There is not a man upon the earth that can shew the king’s matter: therefore there is no king, lord, nor ruler, that asked such things at any magician, or astrologer, or Chaldean. And it is a rare thing that the king requireth, and there is none other that can shew it before the king, except the gods, whose dwelling is not with flesh. ““For this cause the king was angry and very furious, and commanded to destroy all the wise men of Babylon.” —Daniel 2:1-13 Who then appeared before the king? “And the decree went forth that the wise men should be slain; and they sought Daniel and his fellows to be slain. … Then Daniel went in, and desired of the king that he would give him time, and that he would shew the king the interpretation.” —Daniel 2:13, 16 Daniel and his friends were also under the death sentence that the king had pronounced on the wise men, so when he heard about it, he quickly went to the king to ask for more time. What did Daniel do next? “Then Daniel went to his house, and made the thing known to Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah, his companions: that they would desire mercies of the God of heaven concerning this secret; that Daniel and his fellows should not perish with the rest of the wise men of Babylon. Then was the secret revealed unto Daniel in a night vision.” —Daniel 2:17-19 Daniel asked his friends to join him in prayer, seeking God to reveal the dream, and their request was granted when God revealed it to Daniel. This underscores the important role that prayer plays in the life of a Christian. Who did Daniel give credit to? “Daniel answered and said, Blessed be the name of God for ever and ever: for wisdom and might are his: and he changeth the times and the seasons: he removeth kings, and setteth up kings: he giveth wisdom unto the wise, and knowledge to them that know understanding: He revealeth the deep and secret things: he knoweth what is in the darkness, and the light dwelleth with him. I thank thee, and praise thee, O thou God of my fathers, who hast given me wisdom and might, and hast made known unto me now what we desired of thee: for thou hast now made known unto us the king’s matter.” —Daniel 2:20-23 God saved their lives by revealing the king’s dream and its interpretation, and Daniel gave God all the credit. What was the dream’s purpose? “But there is a God in heaven that revealeth secrets, and maketh known to the king Nebuchadnezzar what shall be in the latter days.” —Daniel 2:28 “As for thee, O king, thy thoughts came into thy mind upon thy bed, what should come to pass hereafter: and he that revealeth secrets maketh known to thee what shall come to pass. But as for me, this secret is not revealed to me for any wisdom that I have more than any living, but for their sakes that shall make known the interpretation to the king, and that thou mightest know the thoughts of thy heart.” —Daniel 2:29-30 The dream was God’s answer to the king’s wondering about what the future would hold for his kingdom. What did the king see? “Thou, O king, sawest, and behold a great image. This great image, whose brightness was excellent, stood before thee; and the form thereof was terrible. This image’s head was of fine gold, his breast and his arms of silver, his belly and his thighs of brass, his legs of iron, his feet part of iron and part of clay.” —Daniel 2:31-33 What happened to it? “Thou sawest till that a stone was cut out without hands, which smote the image upon his feet that were of iron and clay, and brake them to pieces. Then was the iron, the clay, the brass, the silver, and the gold, broken to pieces together, and became like the chaff of the summer threshing floors; and the wind carried them away, that no place was found for them: and the stone that smote the image became a great mountain, and filled the whole earth.” —Daniel 2:34-35 Who did the head of gold represent? “This is the dream; and we will tell the interpretation thereof before the king. Thou, O king, art a king of kings: for the God of heaven hath given thee a kingdom, power, and strength, and glory. And wheresoever the children of men dwell, the beasts of the field and the fowls of the heaven hath he given into thine hand, and hath made thee ruler over them all. Thou art this head of gold.” —Daniel 2:36-38 Aptly symbolized by a head of gold, Babylon was one of the most extravagant kingdoms of antiquity. It ruled supreme from 612 BC onward, after conquering the Assyrian capital of Nineveh. The city’s walls were nearly 200 feet high and wide enough for two chariots to ride side by side, while the Hanging Gardens were one of the Seven Wonders of the World. Would his kingdom last? “And after thee shall arise another kingdom inferior to thee, and another third kingdom of brass, which shall bear rule over all the earth.” —Daniel 2:39 Who did the chest of silver represent? “PERES: Thy kingdom is divided, and given to the Medes and Persians.” —Daniel 5:28 “In that night was Belshazzar the king of the Chaldeans slain. And Darius the Median took the kingdom, being about threescore and two years old.” —Daniel 5:30-31 Babylon was conquered by Cyrus in 539 BC, making the Medo-Persian Empire the next dominant power. Under its reign, all taxes were required to be paid in silver. Did the Bible predict Babylon’s fall? “That saith to the deep, Be dry, and I will dry up thy rivers: that saith of Cyrus, He is my shepherd, and shall perform all my pleasure: even saying to Jerusalem, Thou shalt be built; and to the temple, Thy foundation shall be laid.” —Isaiah 44:27-28 “Thus saith the LORD to his anointed, to Cyrus, whose right hand I have holden, to subdue nations before him; and I will loose the loins of kings, to open before him the two leaved gates; and the gates shall not be shut.” —Isaiah 45:1 In one of the most astoundingly detailed prophecies, God not only explicitly named Cyrus through His prophet Isaiah but also predicted the manner in which he would conquer Babylon—more than 150 years before it happened! According to the ancient historian Herodotus, when Cyrus surrounded Babylon, his armies diverted the Euphrates River that flowed through the city, allowing them to pass under the city’s walls by walking on the riverbed. Babylon also had street gates that controlled access to the river, but that night, the gates were left open! What would come next? “And after thee shall arise another kingdom inferior to thee, and another third kingdom of brass, which shall bear rule over all the earth.” —Daniel 2:39 After the silver kingdom symbolizing Medo-Persia, a third kingdom—represented by bronze—would arise. Notably, each succeeding metal in the statue is less valuable but more enduring than the one before it. What kingdom was this? “The ram which thou sawest having two horns are the kings of Media and Persia. And the rough goat is the king of Grecia: and the great horn that is between his eyes is the first king.” —Daniel 8:20-21 Daniel 8 is a parallel prophecy that repeats and expands on the one in Daniel 2, and it identifies Greece as the empire that would succeed Medo-Persia. After a series of campaigns, Alexander the Great delivered a decisive blow to the Persian Empire at the Battle of Arbela in 331 BC, making the kingdom of Greece the next dominant world power. Notably, the armor of Greek soldiers was made entirely of bronze. What is the fourth kingdom like? “And the fourth kingdom shall be strong as iron: forasmuch as iron breaketh in pieces and subdueth all things: and as iron that breaketh all these, shall it break in pieces and bruise.” —Daniel 2:40 The iron monarchy of Rome conquered the Greeks in 168 BC and was the world power when Jesus was born. The legs of iron are a fitting symbol, as Rome’s long reign—lasting over 600 years—brought great persecution to God’s people. What do the iron and clay feet represent? “And whereas thou sawest the feet and toes, part of potters’ clay, and part of iron, the kingdom shall be divided; but there shall be in it of the strength of the iron, forasmuch as thou sawest the iron mixed with miry clay. And as the toes of the feet were part of iron, and part of clay, so the kingdom shall be partly strong, and partly broken.” —Daniel 2:41-42 “O house of Israel, cannot I do with you as this potter? saith the LORD. Behold, as the clay is in the potter’s hand, so are ye in mine hand, O house of Israel.” —Jeremiah 18:6 Unlike the head, chest, thighs, and legs—each made of a single metal—the feet and toes are composed of a mixture of iron and clay. This indicates that the kingdom they represent will be fundamentally different from the ones before it. The iron is described as strong, while the clay—the only non-metal element in the statue—is called “broken” (fragile). Because clay is not a metal, it cannot represent a civil power like the metals that came before it. Jeremiah 18:6 tells us that clay represents God’s people—His church—because of its apparent fragility, especially when contrasted with the strength of civil power, which holds the authority to enforce law and order. When the Christian church started apostatizing, it sought to regain the power of the apostolic church by uniting with civil government to enforce its laws against heretics. The Edict of Milan in AD 313 opened the door for the union of church and state that, in God’s eyes, cannot be legitimately joined (Daniel 2:43). Because this union is unlawful, it will disintegrate at Christ’s second coming, symbolized by the stone cut without hands that crushes the image to powder (Daniel 2:34). The only legitimate union of God’s church is with Jesus Christ, who is described as her Husband (Ephesians 5:25) and the Rock upon which she is built (Ephesians 2:19-22; Matthew 7:24-25). With such a sure Foundation, she has no need for protection or support from civil power to ensure her survival. The mingling of church and state that began in the Roman Empire in AD 313 brought ruin upon the empire in the following century through the invasions of barbarian tribes. This church-state union was then reestablished under the papacy’s ecclesiastical empire in Europe, which lasted from AD 538 until 1798, when Napoleon Bonaparte’s general took Pope Pius VI captive. Although God’s judgment took longer to manifest than it did in the Roman Empire, it still came. A third and final installment of this union will occur just prior to Christ’s Second Coming—this time in the United States—and will then be imitated by the rest of the world. National and global ruin will once again be the inevitable result (Daniel 2:34). What else is significant about the feet? The iron-clay mixture in the feet forms the foundation upon which the entire image stands. This suggests that the union of apostate Christianity with civil power is the culmination toward which history has been trending. Under the Babylonian, Medo-Persian, Grecian, and Roman empires, religion was deeply intertwined with the state, so much so that it became a civic duty rather than merely a personal matter. What is notable about the iron-clay mixture in the feet is that it represents a power claiming to be God’s church—one that ought to know better, especially since Jesus Himself said that His kingdom is not of this world (John 18:36), and that a clear separation between one’s duties to God and to the state must always be maintained (Luke 20:25). In the pagan empires of Babylon, Persia, Greece, and Rome, the state was supreme over religion, using religion to support its authority. However, under the papal government symbolized by the feet, this pattern was reversed: religion was elevated above the state, using the state for its support. Thus, the mingling of religion and government in the pagan empires served as a precursor to the ultimate form of this union under the papacy. Although Constantine began blending church and state in AD 313 with the Edict of Milan, the church did not gain total supremacy over the state until AD 538, when the last barbarian tribe opposing the papacy—the Ostrogoths—was overthrown. With this achieved, Justinian’s decree of 533 AD, which elevated the pope to headship over all churches and appointed him the corrector of all heresies, could be fully enforced. It is remarkable that, instead of clean break between the metals, the iron found in the legs continues into the feet and toes, extending all the way to the end of time. When the Roman Empire crumbled, a new power rose in its place, led by the pope, who claimed the title Pontifex Maximus adopted by the Caesars. Consequently, the Roman element, symbolized by iron, shifted from the civil authority of the Roman Empire to that of the Roman Catholic Church, which claimed this right, in part, based on the forged Donation of Constantine. Pagan Rome had become papal Rome. Under this new arrangement, the pope not only assumed the imperial title of the Caesars but also claimed the religious title Vicar of Christ, asserting himself as the successor of Peter and the head of all churches. Thus, the Roman Catholic Church is a union of church and state, symbolized by the iron and clay, with the state subservient to the church—a complete reversal of the pattern seen in the previous empires. The United States was the first nation to break this trend because of its Constitution; however, even this would prove to be only temporary, as prophecy predicts a future union of church and state in the United States prior to the Second Coming of Christ. This will not be the first occurrence either, as the Supreme Court’s landmark 1892 decision in Church of the Holy Trinity v. United States declared the United States a Christian nation. Moreover, that same year, Congress passed legislation to close the World’s Columbian Exposition on Sundays in honor of Sunday observance, which was also approved by President Benjamin Harrison. As a result, only 101 years after the ratification of the First Amendment, which established the separation of church and state, all three branches of the United States government had repudiated it. Why must this separation be maintained? Because the state has no right to dictate anything in the realm of worship, which belongs exclusively to God and in which the individual’s right of conscience reigns supreme. This principle was understood early on—more than a millennium before it was enshrined in the U.S. Constitution—as seen in the following excerpt from a letter sent in AD 524 by Theodoric the Great, king of Italy, to the Byzantine emperor Justin I: “To pretend to a dominion over the conscience, is to usurp the prerogative of God. By the nature of things, the power of sovereigns is confined to political government. They have no right of punishment but over those who disturb the public peace. The most dangerous heresy is that of a sovereign who separates himself from part of his subjects, because they believe not according to his belief.” —Quoted in A. T. Jones, The Two Republics, 537 (1891). The Edict of Milan ordered that church property confiscated under the edicts of Diocletian be restored to Christians, which sparked controversy over which groups of believers qualified as Christians. A year after the Edict of Milan, Constantine convened the Council of Arles to address the issue, and the council affirmed the Catholic Church as the representative of orthodox Christianity. What is represented by the toes? “And the ten horns out of this kingdom are ten kings that shall arise: and another shall rise after them; and he shall be diverse from the first, and he shall subdue three kings.” —Daniel 7:24 The prophecy of Daniel 2 is expanded in Daniel 7: just as the image in Daniel 2 has ten toes, so the fourth beast in Daniel 7 has ten horns. Eighteen distinct tribes played a role in the destruction of the Western Roman Empire, but exactly ten—no more, no less—remained when the Empire finally collapsed in AD 476, just as the Bible had predicted by the ten toes. Three of the ten were destroyed, but the seven remaining would give rise to the modern nations of Europe: Visigoths (Spain), Franks (France), Alemanni (Germany), Suevi (Portugal), Anglo-Saxons (England), Burgundians (Switzerland), Lombards (Italy), Heruli (destroyed in 493 AD), Vandals (destroyed in 534 AD), and Ostrogoths (destroyed in 538 AD). The eighteen tribes were the Alemanni, Alans, Angles, Burgundians, Franks, Gepids, Heruli, Huns, Jutes, Lombards, Ostrogoths, Rugians, Saxons, Sciri, Suevi, Thuringians, Vandals, and Visigoths. Will national divisions be abolished? Since the toes are the final portion of the image, the national divisions they symbolize will remain until the second coming of Christ, despite numerous attempts throughout history to abolish them. Leaders such as Charlemagne, Napoleon, Kaiser Wilhelm II, and Hitler all tried and failed to restore a fully unified empire. Even modern efforts, like the European Union, will not succeed. No power will ever rise again to unite all nations under a single empire, as Babylon, Medo-Persia, Greece, and Rome once did. Revelation predicts that just before Christ’s return, all the nations of the world will unite to destroy God’s people, but God will intervene before their plans are carried out. What happens next? “And in the days of these kings shall the God of heaven set up a kingdom, which shall never be destroyed: and the kingdom shall not be left to other people, but it shall break in pieces and consume all these kingdoms, and it shall stand for ever. Forasmuch as thou sawest that the stone was cut out of the mountain without hands, and that it brake in pieces the iron, the brass, the clay, the silver, and the gold; the great God hath made known to the king what shall come to pass hereafter: and the dream is certain, and the interpretation thereof sure.” —Daniel 2:44-45 The stone cut without hands represents Christ’s eternal kingdom, which will replace all earthly kingdoms at His return. Some have misapplied the symbolism of the stone to represent an earthly millennial kingdom established by His Church, but this cannot be the case, as the Bible teaches that the earth will be completely destroyed at His Second Coming and that the saved will be caught up to heaven. The stone, by the way, strikes the image at its feet, which indicates that Jesus will return during the time of the divided nations. Any other Bible references to Christ’s kingdom? “Ask of Me, and I will give You the nations for Your inheritance, and the ends of the earth for Your possession. You shall break them with a rod of iron; You shall dash them to pieces like a potter’s vessel.” —Psalm 2:8-9, NKJV “Jesus saith unto them, Did ye never read in the scriptures, The stone which the builders rejected, the same is become the head of the corner: this is the Lord’s doing, and it is marvellous in our eyes? Therefore say I unto you, The kingdom of God shall be taken from you, and given to a nation bringing forth the fruits thereof. And whosoever shall fall on this stone shall be broken: but on whomsoever it shall fall, it will grind him to powder.” —Matthew 21:42-44 In Psalm 2, David, under divine inspiration, foreshadowed the prophecy of Daniel 2:34—centuries before it was revealed. Jesus also compared Himself to the Stone that would grind to powder those upon whom it falls—a reference to those who reject His mercy. In contrast, those who fall on the Stone of their own accord will be broken; that is, when they encounter the reality of His love, they are humbled and choose to surrender their pride and self-righteousness to Him (Matthew 5:5). What hope does the Bible give? “For the grace of God that bringeth salvation hath appeared to all men, teaching us that, denying ungodliness and worldly lusts, we should live soberly, righteously, and godly, in this present world; looking for that blessed hope, and the glorious appearing of the great God and our Saviour Jesus Christ.” —Titus 2:11-13 “Nevertheless we, according to his promise, look for new heavens and a new earth, wherein dwelleth righteousness.” —2 Peter 3:13 “And I saw a new heaven and a new earth: for the first heaven and the first earth were passed away; and there was no more sea. And I John saw the holy city, new Jerusalem, coming down from God out of heaven, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband. And I heard a great voice out of heaven saying, Behold, the tabernacle of God is with men, and he will dwell with them, and they shall be his people, and God himself shall be with them, and be their God. And God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes; and there shall be no more death, neither sorrow, nor crying, neither shall there be any more pain: for the former things are passed away.” —Revelation 21:1-4 Daniel 2 teaches that God knows the end from the beginning and is Sovereign over all of history (Isaiah 46:9-10; Proverbs 21:1; Daniel 2:21). He has granted every empire ample time and opportunity to come to know Him, but when His mercies are resisted and His truth rejected, the guilty empire falls, and another rises in its place ( Acts 17:26-27). This pattern is evident in the rise and fall of Babylon, Medo-Persia, Greece, and Rome, and it will continue until history reaches its climactic point: the return of Christ in the clouds to establish His eternal kingdom, free from sin and all the sorrow it brings. The Bible assures us that this present world of pain, suffering, and evil will not endure forever. Soon, it will be replaced by Christ’s glorious new kingdom, where righteousness dwells.",

I saw the ram pushing westward, and northward, and southward; so that no beasts might stand before him, neither was there any that could deliver out of his hand; but he did according to his will, and became great.” —Daniel 8:3-4 “The ram which thou sawest having two horns are the kings of Media and Persia.” —Daniel 8:20 Daniel sees a two-horned lamb, which we later learn represents the kingdom of Medo-Persia. This same kingdom was represented by a bear in Daniel 7:5 since the Bible operates on the principle of “repeat and expand” where the prophecy is repeated and more detail is added. What does he see next? “And as I was considering, behold, an he goat came from the west on the face of the whole earth, and touched not the ground: and the goat had a notable horn between his eyes. And he came to the ram that had two horns, which I had seen standing before the river, and ran unto him in the fury of his power. And I saw him come close unto the ram, and he was moved with choler against him, and smote the ram, and brake his two horns: and there was no power in the ram to stand before him, but he cast him down to the ground, and stamped upon him: and there was none that could deliver the ram out of his hand. Therefore the he goat waxed very great: and when he was strong, the great horn was broken; and for it came up four notable ones toward the four winds of heaven.” —Daniel 8:5-8 “And the rough goat is the king of Grecia: and the great horn that is between his eyes is the first king. Now that being broken, whereas four stood up for it, four kingdoms shall stand up out of the nation, but not in his power.” —Daniel 8:21-22 Daniel then sees a goat with a large horn moving so swiftly that its feet never touch the ground. The goat attacks the ram, conquers it, and the goat’s horn is then broken off and replaced with four other horns. We later learn this goat represents the kingdom of Greece. The great horn is none other than Alexander the Great, while the four horns it’s replaced by represent the four kingdoms into which his empire was divided. In Daniel 7:6 this same kingdom is represented by a leopard with four heads. What does Daniel see next? “And out of one of them came forth a little horn, which waxed exceeding great, toward the south, and toward the east, and toward the pleasant land. And it waxed great, even to the host of heaven; and it cast down some of the host and of the stars to the ground, and stamped upon them. Yea, he magnified himself even to the prince of the host, and by him the daily sacrifice was taken away, and the place of his sanctuary was cast down. And an host was given him against the daily sacrifice by reason of transgression, and it cast down the truth to the ground; and it practised, and prospered.” —Daniel 8:9-12 Next, Daniel sees a little horn emerge. Using the principle of “repeat and expand” this can be none other than Rome in both its pagan and papal forms because Daniel chapter 2 and chapter 7 both point to Rome as the next kingdom after Greece. Later, this little horn is “broken without hand” (Daniel 8:25), meaning destroyed supernaturally by the coming of Christ, which is an echo of Daniel 2:34 where a stone “cut out without hands” puts an end to human civilization. This also fits with Daniel 7:24-27 where it says that papal Rome will be overcome by the kingdom of Christ. Daniel 8:9 gives another clue when it describes the direction of little horn’s expansion, which fits the expansion of Rome perfectly: toward the south (Egypt), toward the east (Macedonia), and the “pleasant land” (Palestine). Furthermore, Daniel 8:4 describes Medo-Persia as becoming “great,” Greece becomes “very great” (Daniel 8:8), and the little horn becomes “exceeding great.” Rome is the only power following Greece that became “exceeding great.” The little horn also “magnified himself even to the prince of the host” (Daniel 8:11), and verse 25 says it will “stand up against the Prince of princes” (Daniel 8:25). These are clear references to Jesus Christ, and once again, pagan Rome, being the power that crucified Him, fits these points. Papal Rome, on the other hand, effectively tries to replace Jesus’ ministry, as our High Priest in the heavenly sanctuary (Hebrews 8:1-2), with an earthly priesthood claiming to forgive sins even though the Bible teaches Jesus is our only Mediator (1 Timothy 2:5), and only God can forgive sins (Luke 5:21). This casts the truth of the heavenly sanctuary to the ground (Daniel 8:11), trampling it underfoot (Daniel 8:13), thereby fulfilling those points as well. How long would the sanctuary be trampled underfoot? “Then I heard one saint speaking, and another saint said unto that certain saint which spake, How long shall be the vision concerning the daily sacrifice, and the transgression of desolation, to give both the sanctuary and the host to be trodden under foot? And he said unto me, Unto two thousand and three hundred days; then shall the sanctuary be cleansed.” —Daniel 8:13-14 The reply was that the sanctuary would be cleansed after 2,300 days, which is 2,300 literal years in Bible prophecy (Ezekiel 4:6; Numbers 14:34). We’ve already learned that in the time of ancient Israel the earthly sanctuary was cleansed on the Day of Atonement. This was a day when the camp of Israel was cleansed from sin because God’s true followers were identified and their sins removed, while those who clung to sin were separated from the camp. In the same manner, Daniel is shown here that sin and the little horn power would not control and oppress the world forever; instead, God would intervene after 2,300 years with the heavenly Day of Atonement during which the process of removing sin would begin. To what time does this prophecy apply? “So he came near where I stood: and when he came, I was afraid, and fell upon my face: but he said unto me, Understand, O son of man: for at the time of the end shall be the vision.” —Daniel 8:17 “And the vision of the evening and the morning which was told is true: wherefore shut thou up the vision; for it shall be for many days.” —Daniel 8:26 The angel made it clear that this prophecy dealt with end time events, which means it’s particularly relevant for us. Daniel was perplexed by the vision and actually fell ill after receiving it (Daniel 8:27), but in the next chapter God sent the angel Gabriel to explain the vision to him (Daniel 9:21-23). How much time was alloted to Daniel’s people? “Seventy weeks are determined upon thy people and upon thy holy city, to finish the transgression, and to make an end of sins, and to make reconciliation for iniquity, and to bring in everlasting righteousness, and to seal up the vision and prophecy, and to anoint the most Holy.” —Daniel 9:24 The angel says that seventy weeks were alloted to the Jewish people, which would equal 490 days (70 7), which represent 490 years in Bible prophecy. At the time of the vision God’s people were in captivity in Medo-Persia, but soon they were to return home, and God was giving them 490 years out of the 2,300 as another opportunity to repent from their sins and be reconciled to Him. What was the starting point for the prophecy? “Know therefore and understand, that from the going forth of the command to restore and build Jerusalem until Messiah the Prince, there shall be seven weeks and sixty-two weeks; the street shall be built again, and the wall, even in troublesome times.” —Daniel 9:25, NKJV “And there went up some of the children of Israel, and of the priests, and the Levites, and the singers, and the porters, and the Nethinims, unto Jerusalem, in the seventh year of Artaxerxes the king.” —Ezra 7:7 The starting point was a decree authorizing God’s people to rebuild Jerusalem. The decree, recorded in Ezra 7:11-26, was issued by King Artaxerxes Longimanus in 457 B.C., in the seventh year of his reign, and implemented in the autumn of that year. This was the third in a series of three decrees: originated by Cyrus, re-affirmed by Darius, and completed by Artaxerxes. “And the elders of the Jews builded, and they prospered through the prophesying of Haggai the prophet and Zechariah the son of Iddo. And they builded, and finished it, according to the commandment of the God of Israel, and according to the commandment of Cyrus, and Darius, and Artaxerxes king of Persia.” —Ezra 6:14 The first two decrees dealt primarily with the rebuilding of the temple, but it was the third that established judges and counselors, in direct fulfillment of Isaiah’s prophecy, written before the Babylonian destruction of Jerusalem: “And I will restore thy judges as at the first, and thy counselors as at the beginning: afterward thou shalt be called, The city of righteousness, the faithful city. Zion shall be redeemed with judgment, and her converts with righteousness.” —Isaiah 1:26-27 Its fulfillment is found in the decree itself: “And thou, Ezra, after the wisdom of thy God, that is in thine hand, set magistrates and judges, which may judge all the people that are beyond the river, all such as know the laws of thy God; and teach ye them that know them not.” —Ezra 7:25 The rebuilding of the temple—authorized by the first two decrees—was not enough. The prophecy of Daniel 9:24, to “restore and rebuild Jerusalem,” could not be fulfilled until the Israelites regained the authority to appoint magistrates and judges to teach and restore the law of God, as had been the case before their Babylonian captivity. Following the restoration of judges, Isaiah 1:26-27 promised, “afterward thou shalt be called, The city of righteousness, the faithful city,” which was fulfilled in the Messiah, who would “bring in everlasting righteousness” (Daniel 9:24) through a perfectly righteous life, made available to all who receive Him by faith! How many weeks were there until the Messiah? “Know therefore and understand, that from the going forth of the command to restore and build Jerusalem until Messiah the Prince, there shall be seven weeks and sixty-two weeks; the street shall be built again, and the wall, even in troublesome times.” —Daniel 9:25, NKJV The angel said that from 457 B.C. there would be 69 weeks or 483 days (69 7), which represent 483 literal years. So starting with -457 and adding 483 gives us 26, but since there is no year 0, we add one year, which brings us to the year A.D. 27, the baptism of Jesus (Luke 3:21-22). The word “Messiah” means “anointed,” and it was during His baptism that He was anointed with the Holy Spirit (Acts 10:38). The baptism year is confirmed in Luke 3:1 as the fifteenth year of Tiberius Caesar’s reign (A.D. 27), which is remarkable considering the prophecy was made over 500 years before! After His baptism Jesus began to preach that “the time is fulfilled” (Mark 1:14-15), a clear reference to the 2,300 year prophecy and an indication of its importance. The prophecy, therefore, not only makes it plain that Jesus is the Messiah, but it also testifies that the Bible is divinely inspired! When was the Messiah to be “cut off”? “And after the sixty-two weeks Messiah shall be cut off, but not for Himself; and the people of the prince who is to come shall destroy the city and the sanctuary. The end of it shall be with a flood, and till the end of the war desolations are determined. Then He shall confirm a covenant with many for one week; but in the middle of the week He shall bring an end to sacrifice and offering. And on the wing of abominations shall be one who makes desolate, even until the consummation, which is determined, is poured out on the desolate.” —Daniel 9:26-27, NKJV “But He was wounded for our transgressions, He was bruised for our iniquities: the chastisement of our peace was upon Him; and with His stripes we are healed.” —Isaiah 53:5 Since there are 69 weeks from 457 B.C. to A.D. 27, there is one week left (7 days, that is, 7 years) in the 490 year prophecy. In the middle of that last week in A.D. 31, three and a half years after His baptism, Jesus was “cut off” (crucified) not for Himself, since He was sinless (1 Peter 2:22), but for us, thereby bringing an end to the system of animal sacrifices, which was confirmed by the veil in the temple being miraculously torn from top to bottom (Matthew 27:50-51). The One to whom all the sacrifices pointed gave Himself, as the great and true sacrifice, for the remission of our sins (Romans 3:25; 1 Corinthians 15:3), to heal us from the wound of sin! By the way, the Passover lamb was sacrificed every year on the 14th day of the Hebrew month of Nisan, and Jesus, our Passover Lamb, died exactly on that day! The priests were getting ready to sacrifice the Passover lamb as the true Lamb was hanging on the cross, about to be sacrificed for the sins of the world (1 Corinthians 5:7). And all of this was predicted before it even happened by a God who sees the end from the beginning (Isaiah 46:10)! What significant event occured next? “Then He shall confirm a covenant with many for one week; but in the middle of the week He shall bring an end to sacrifice and offering. And on the wing of abominations shall be one who makes desolate, even until the consummation, which is determined, is poured out on the desolate.” —Daniel 9:27, NKJV “How shall we escape, if we neglect so great salvation; which at the first began to be spoken by the Lord, and was confirmed unto us by them that heard him.” —Hebrews 2:3 Once Jesus died and ascended to heaven, His earthly ministry ended, but He confirmed the covenant, to save His people from their sins (Hebrews 10:16-17), through His disciples, whom He sent to preach to the Jewish nation first (Matthew 10:5-6) because they still had three and a half years remaining as part of their 490-year opportunity to repent from their sins. This period came to an end in A.D. 34, three and a half years after Jesus’ death, when the testimony of Stephen was rejected by the Jewish religious leaders, and he ended up being stoned to death (Acts 7:54-60). This final, collective rejection of God’s plan to save them meant that the Jews could no longer be His exclusive people, and from A.D. 34, the disciples started preaching the gospel to all the nations of the world (Matthew 21:43; Acts 8:4; 13:46). Who are God’s chosen people now? “For as many of you as have been baptized into Christ have put on Christ. There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither bond nor free, there is neither male nor female: for ye are all one in Christ Jesus. And if ye be Christ’s, then are ye Abraham’s seed, and heirs according to the promise.” —Galatians 3:27-29 “For the scripture saith, Whosoever believeth on him shall not be ashamed. For there is no difference between the Jew and the Greek: for the same Lord over all is rich unto all that call upon him. For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.” —Romans 10:11-13 “For he is not a Jew, which is one outwardly; neither is that circumcision, which is outward in the flesh: But he is a Jew, which is one inwardly; and circumcision is that of the heart, in the spirit, and not in the letter; whose praise is not of men, but of God.” —Romans 2:28-29 God’s people are now those of any nation who choose to accept and serve Him, becoming spiritual Jews—spiritual descendants of Abraham, fulfilling the promise God gave to Abraham that in him all the families of the earth would be blessed (Genesis 12:1-3). But, of course, spiritual Jews also include any Jewish person who individually accepts Jesus as Lord and Savior. What happens at the end of the 2,300 year prophecy? “And he said unto me, Unto two thousand and three hundred days; then shall the sanctuary be cleansed.” —Daniel 8:14 “It was therefore necessary that the patterns of things in the heavens should be purified with these; but the heavenly things themselves with better sacrifices than these.” —Hebrews 9:23 “And I saw another angel fly in the midst of heaven, having the everlasting gospel to preach unto them that dwell on the earth, and to every nation, and kindred, and tongue, and people, saying with a loud voice, Fear God, and give glory to him; for the hour of his judgment is come: and worship him that made heaven, and earth, and the sea, and the fountains of waters.” —Revelation 14:6-7 After the 490 year prophecy ended in A.D. 34, there were 1,810 years remaining in the 2,300 year one (2,300 minus 490), which means it ended in 1844. According to Daniel, this was the year when the cleansing of the sanctuary began. We’ve already learned that when the system of animal sacrifices was made obsolete by the death of Jesus, the veil of the temple was torn by the divine hand of God. Shortly after, the temple itself was destroyed by the Romans in A.D. 70 and never rebuilt, so the sanctuary that is cleansed can only be the heavenly one, of which the earthly one was a symbol. The cleansing of the earthly sanctuary always occured on the Day of Atonement (to “atone” means to be “at one” with God), which was a time of judgment during which God’s people examined their souls to make sure all of their sins were confessed, forsaken, and symbolically “blotted out” from the sanctuary; likewise, the heavenly judgment began in 1844 and the sins of God’s people began to be removed from the books of heaven (Daniel 7:10). In other words, prior to 1844, confessed and forsaken sins were forgiven by God because of Jesus’ substitutionary sacrifice on the sinners behalf, but they remained on the books. After 1844, when the heavenly judgment began, God started to blot out even the very record of those confessed sins (Acts 3:19)! Who is being judged first? “For the time is come that judgment must begin at the house of God: and if it first begin at us, what shall the end be of them that obey not the gospel of God?” —1 Peter 4:17 “And to the others he said in mine hearing, Go ye after him through the city, and smite: let not your eye spare, neither have ye pity: slay utterly old and young, both maids, and little children, and women: but come not near any man upon whom is the mark; and begin at my sanctuary. Then they began at the ancient men which were before the house.” —Ezekiel 9:5-6 In the Bible judgment always begins with God’s people. The heavenly judgment that began in 1844 is the “pre-advent judgment,” the first phase, since it occurs before the second coming of Christ. Jesus returns with His reward (Revelation 22:11-12), which means those who are saved have been identified and their reward determined. Just like in the earthly Day of Atonement judgment there was a separation of the unrepentant from the camp of Israel before sin was removed from the sanctuary (Leviticus 23:29), so in the heavenly sanctuary there is an identification of who is saved and who is lost during the pre-advent judgment. This is why Peter says the judgment begins with the “house of God,” meaning the people of God. Anyone who has claimed to be a Christian, alive or dead, will be examined during this judgment. And it’s already in session (Revelation 14:7), which is why we are called to put away our sins and be “at one” with God. We are the temple of God now that there is no longer an earthly sanctuary. It’s us that God wants to cleanse from sin because His desire is to abide in us through His Holy Spirit (1 Corinthians 6:19-20). When is the second phase of the judgment? “Do ye not know that the saints shall judge the world? and if the world shall be judged by you, are ye unworthy to judge the smallest matters? Know ye not that we shall judge angels? how much more things that pertain to this life?” —1 Corinthians 6:3 “And I saw thrones, and they sat upon them, and judgment was given unto them: and I saw the souls of them that were beheaded for the witness of Jesus, and for the word of God, and which had not worshipped the beast, neither his image, neither had received his mark upon their foreheads, or in their hands; and they lived and reigned with Christ a thousand years.” —Revelation 20:4 After Jesus takes the saved to heaven, they will participate in the second phase of the judgment, during which the life of every lost person, including Satan and his angels, will be examined and all questions will be answered. Ultimately, the saved will agree that Jesus’ judgments were not arbitrary, but just and true (Revelation 15:3). They will see that Jesus only confirms the decision that has already been made in a person’s heart to either serve Him or another (Revelation 22:11-12). When is the third phase? “And I saw a great white throne, and him that sat on it, from whose face the earth and the heaven fled away; and there was found no place for them. And I saw the dead, small and great, stand before God; and the books were opened: and another book was opened, which is the book of life: and the dead were judged out of those things which were written in the books, according to their works.” —Revelation 20:11-12 “For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ; that every one may receive the things done in his body, according to that he hath done, whether it be good or bad.” —2 Corinthians 5:10 “But why dost thou judge thy brother? or why dost thou set at nought thy brother? for we shall all stand before the judgment seat of Christ. For it is written, As I live, saith the Lord, every knee shall bow to me, and every tongue shall confess to God. So then every one of us shall give account of himself to God.” —Romans 14:10-12 The third phase of the judgment is for the lost of all ages, and it takes place after the 1,000 years. Every lost soul will look back on his or her life and remember God’s patient calls to repentance—the numerous convictions of the Holy Spirit that were repeatedly refused. The books will be opened and God’s attempts to save every person will be made plain. The lost will understand that God did everything He could to save them, and every person will fall on their knees, including Satan and his angels, in confession that God has been just and fair in His dealing with every soul (Philippians 2:10-11; Romans 14:11). The lost will realize they can only blame their own resistance to God’s pleadings of mercy (Hosea 13:9), and they acknowledge His love, mercy, and justice, clearing Him of all false accusations. What happens next? “And they went up on the breadth of the earth, and compassed the camp of the saints about, and the beloved city: and fire came down from God out of heaven, and devoured them. And the devil that deceived them was cast into the lake of fire and brimstone, where the beast and the false prophet are, and shall be tormented day and night for ever and ever.” —Revelation 20:9-10 In the end, God will honor the choices of Satan, his angels, and all people who joined his rebellion and rejected His mercy (Revelation 22:11-12). In order to cleanse the universe from sin, and because life cannot exist apart from the Life-Giver, the lives of those who chose to cling to sin, despite receiving numerous opportunities to be cleansed from it, will come to an end in the fire that will fall from heaven. Ultimately, this is an act of mercy because sin only leads to pain, suffering, and sorrow; nevertheless, the act will bring immeasurable anguish to the heart of God (Ezekiel 33:11) because these are people whom He loved so much that He sent His only Son to die for them (John 3:16). No doubt Jesus will weep over those whom He wanted to save. Guardian angels will likely weep over the ones they served to protect. It will be a time of immense sorrow for the saved as well because it’s likely many will have a loved one in the fire. The good news is the fire does not burn forever. The pain and suffering will come to an end, and God will create a new earth on which He will dwell with His people (Revelation 21:1-5). The harmony that existed between Adam, Eve, and their Creator will be restored, and sin will never rise up again (Nahum 1:9)! What good news do we have? “There is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit.” —Romans 8:1 “If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.” —1 John 1:9 The judgment has been in session since 1844, and even though it may seem like a dreadful thing to many, it’s actually full of good news: - The central purpose of the judgment is to vindicate God’s character and government before the universe, because Lucifer, in his rebellion, suggested that, if given the chance, he would establish a better form of government than God, but in the end, every human and angel, including Satan, will bow in confession that God’s ways are love, mercy, and justice (Philippians 2:10-11; Revelation 15:3). - The judgment is declared in favor of God’s people (Daniel 7:21-22) because all of their sins have been confessed, forgiven, and cleansed by Jesus (1 John 1:9); there is no condemnation to those who are in Christ (Romans 8:1). - Those who rejected God’s mercy will not be tortured in hell endlessly (Malachi 4:1). - Jesus presides as Judge (John 5:22); He is also the Advocate and the Witness for the saved (1 John 2:1; Revelation 3:14). With Jesus on my side, I have nothing to fear. - The Father and the Son want every person to be saved (John 3:16; 13:1; 1 Timothy 2:3-4); Satan is our only accusser (Revelation 12:10). The judgment revolves around the atonement, being “at one” or reconciled with God, and Jesus is in the center of it all! He is the only One who can remove sin from our lives (Acts 4:12). If you haven’t done so, now is the time to get right with God and accept Jesus as Lord and Savior (2 Corinthians 6:2). God is still offering forgiveness and mercy to those who come to His throne (Hebrews 4:14-16; 7:25), and Jesus is still knocking (Revelation 3:20).",

      "body": "Has the judgment already begun? “And I saw another angel fly in the midst of heaven, having the everlasting gospel to preach unto them that dwell on the earth, and to every nation, and kindred, and tongue, and people, saying with a loud voice, Fear God, and give glory to him; for the hour of his judgment is come: and worship him that made heaven, and earth, and the sea, and the fountains of waters.” —Revelation 14:6-7 “And, behold, I come quickly; and my reward is with me, to give every man according as his work shall be.” —Revelation 22:12 In Acts 24:25 Paul talks about a coming judgment, meaning it had not happened yet. In Revelation 14, on the other hand, there are three angels proclaiming a message to the people of the world in the last days, and the first angel’s message is that the judgment has begun. So the judgment begins in the last days, which we are living in. When Jesus comes back to earth He’s bringing a reward with Him, which means the judgment has already taken place to decide who will be saved and what their reward will be. Who will be judged? “For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ; that every one may receive the things done in his body, according to that he hath done, whether it be good or bad.” —2 Corinthians 5:10 “So then every one of us shall give account of himself to God.” —Romans 14:12 Every person who has ever lived on planet earth will be judged. Furthermore, each person will be responsible for his or her own actions; it will not be possible to hide behind another person’s decisions, actions, or ultimatums. Who else is part of the judgment? “I beheld till the thrones were cast down, and the Ancient of Days did sit, whose garment was white as snow, and the hair of his head like the pure wool: his throne was like the fiery flame, and his wheels as burning fire. A fiery stream issued and came forth from before him: thousand thousands ministered unto him, and ten thousand times ten thousand stood before him: the judgment was set, and the books were opened.” —Daniel 7:9-10 “For the Father judgeth no man, but hath committed all judgment unto the Son.” —John 5:22 “My little children, these things write I unto you, that ye sin not. And if any man sin, we have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous.” —1 John 2:1 “And the great dragon was cast out, that old serpent, called the Devil, and Satan, which deceiveth the whole world: he was cast out into the earth … for the accuser of our brethren is cast down, which accused them before our God day and night.” —Revelation 12:9-10 God the Father, the Ancient of Days, presides over the judgment, while Jesus is the Judge, as well as our Advocate! Satan is our only accusser, declaring that we don’t deserve to be saved any more than he does. Is it possible to hide anything from God? “Let us hear the conclusion of the whole matter: Fear God, and keep his commandments: for this is the whole duty of man. For God shall bring every work into judgment, with every secret thing, whether it be good, or whether it be evil.” —Ecclesiastes 12:13-14 “But I say unto you, That every idle word that men shall speak, they shall give account thereof in the day of judgment.” —Matthew 12:36 “Neither is there any creature that is not manifest in his sight: but all things are naked and opened unto the eyes of him with whom we have to do.” —Hebrews 4:13 “Therefore judge nothing before the time, until the Lord come, who both will bring to light the hidden things of darkness, and will make manifest the counsels of the hearts: and then shall every man have praise of God.” —1 Corinthians 4:5 Does God keep a record of evidence for the judgment? “And I saw the dead, small and great, stand before God; and the books were opened: and another book was opened, which is the book of life: and the dead were judged out of those things which were written in the books, according to their works.” —Revelation 20:12 “And there shall in no wise enter into it any thing that defileth, neither whatsoever worketh abomination, or maketh a lie: but they which are written in the Lamb’s book of life.” —Revelation 21:27 “For though thou wash thee with nitre, and take thee much soap, yet thine iniquity is marked before me, saith the Lord GOD.” —Jeremiah 2:22 “Then those who feared the Lord spoke to one another, and the Lord listened attentively and heard it, and a book of remembrance was written before Him for those who fear the Lord and esteem His name.” —Malachi 3:16, NASB Evidence for the judgment comes from books containing every detail of a person’s life, including every sin. There is also a Book of Remembrance containing every kind word, unselfish act, or sacrifice made by those who follow Jesus as evidence of God’s transforming power in their lives. These people’s names are also written in the Book of Life. What is God’s standard in the judgment? “If ye fulfil the royal law according to the scripture, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself, ye do well: But if ye have respect to persons, ye commit sin, and are convinced of the law as transgressors. For whosoever shall keep the whole law, and yet offend in one point, he is guilty of all. For he that said, Do not commit adultery, said also, Do not kill. Now if thou commit no adultery, yet if thou kill, thou art become a transgressor of the law. So speak ye, and so do, as they that shall be judged by the law of liberty.” —James 2:10-12 “Whosoever committeth sin transgresseth also the law: for sin is the transgression of the law.” —1 John 3:4 If God keeps a record of our sins, and sin is the transgression of the law, then the Ten Commandment law is God’s standard by which we will be judged. Is anyone righteous before the law? “For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God.” —Romans 3:23 “Wherefore, as by one man sin entered into the world, and death by sin; and so death passed upon all men, for that all have sinned.” —Romans 5:12 Because all have sinned, everyone is under condemnation before the law. If nothing is done to remedy the situation, by default, every person sits on “death row” and simply waits for the judgment. How can my record of sin be blotted out? “Repent ye therefore, and be converted, that your sins may be blotted out, when the times of refreshing shall come from the presence of the Lord.” —Acts 3:19 “Seek ye the LORD while he may be found, call ye upon him while he is near: Let the wicked forsake his way, and the unrighteous man his thoughts: and let him return unto the LORD, and he will have mercy upon him; and to our God, for he will abundantly pardon.” —Isaiah 55:6-7 Even though all have sinned, every person has hope of forgiveness! God the Father offers forgiveness to all who come to Him in repentance and forsaking of sin. What role does Jesus play in this? “But this man, because he continueth ever, hath an unchangeable priesthood. Wherefore he is able also to save them to the uttermost that come unto God by him, seeing he ever liveth to make intercession for them.” —Hebrews 7:24-25 “For we have not an high priest which cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities; but was in all points tempted like as we are, yet without sin. Let us therefore come boldly unto the throne of grace, that we may obtain mercy, and find grace to help in time of need.” —Hebrews 4:15-16 “I will bear the indignation of the LORD, because I have sinned against him, until he plead my cause, and execute judgment for me: he will bring me forth to the light, and I shall behold his righteousness.” —Micah 7:9 Because Jesus understands us and can sympathize with our weaknesses, He intercedes on our behalf when we come to the Father through Him, asking for forgiveness. As our Advocate, He pleads the case of every repentant sinner who is accused by Satan, ensuring that we do not face judgment alone. In fact, we are incapable of winning our case without Him. However, not only is Jesus with us in judgment, but He never brings judgment upon us apart from Himself; instead, He first brings it upon Himself, bearing its condemnation on our behalf (2 Corinthians 5:21; 1 Peter 2:24; Galatians 3:13-14). Judgment, therefore, is a revelation of the heart of God and a vindication of His character, for none of the angels—Satan himself included—could have imagined that their Commander would be willing to take on human nature and hang on the cross for His beloved creation. What role does the Holy Spirit play? “Nevertheless I tell you the truth; It is expedient for you that I go away: for if I go not away, the Comforter will not come unto you; but if I depart, I will send him unto you. And when he is come, he will reprove the world of sin, and of righteousness, and of judgment.” —John 16:7-8 “But the Comforter, which is the Holy Ghost, whom the Father will send in my name, he shall teach you all things, and bring all things to your remembrance, whatsoever I have said unto you.” —John 14:26 The Holy Spirit plays a crucial role as well by convicting us of sin and bringing to remembrance sins we have not confessed yet so there isn’t a single unconfessed sin left in our heavenly record for Satan to point to as a witness against us in the judgment. What happens to those whose record of sin has been removed? “There is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit. For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus hath made me free from the law of sin and death. For what the law could not do, in that it was weak through the flesh, God sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh, and for sin, condemned sin in the flesh: that the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit.” —Romans 8:1-4 “He that overcometh, the same shall be clothed in white raiment; and I will not blot out his name out of the book of life, but I will confess his name before my Father, and before his angels.” —Revelation 3:5 “Notwithstanding in this rejoice not, that the spirits are subject unto you; but rather rejoice, because your names are written in heaven.” —Luke 10:20 Those whose record of sin has been blotted out are no longer under condemnation because they have been forgiven through Christ, who paid the penalty for their sin on the cross and who stands before the law on their behalf with His perfect character. The law can now be fulfilled in them through the abiding presence and enabling power of the Spirit, and their names will not be blotted out from the Book of Life! What warning did Jesus give to Christians? “And take heed to yourselves, lest at any time your hearts be overcharged with surfeiting, and drunkenness, and cares of this life, and so that day come upon you unawares.” —Luke 21:34 “For the Son of man is as a man taking a far journey, who left his house, and gave authority to his servants, and to every man his work, and commanded the porter to watch. Watch ye therefore: for ye know not when the master of the house cometh, at even, or at midnight, or at the cockcrowing, or in the morning: Lest coming suddenly he find you sleeping.” —Mark 13:34-36 Jesus warned about four specific things: - Surfeiting: This means “excess,” and it can be anything that disturbs balance and violates the principle of temperance (Galatians 5:22-25), such as overeating, overwork, or even recreation, which is very beneficial when done it moderation. - Drunkenness: This is anything that brings about a spiritual stupor, destroys clear thinking, and removes our desire for heavenly things. Examples include pornography, alcoholism, illicit sex, worldly entertainment, and so on, because they lead to living in a dream world. - Cares of this life: These are perfectly fine activities that are a part of life, but when they take over our lives they take time away from Jesus and shift our focus away from eternal realities, leading to less time spent in prayer, studying His word, and being an active member of His church. - Sleeping: Jesus is referring to spiritually asleep here, and this involves taking the Bible and the truth it reveals about Him for granted. It’s being indifferent about our relationship with Jesus and neglecting the principles of His kingdom (2 Timothy 3:5). In Revelation 3:15-19 it’s described as being lukewarm—being falsely satisfied with one’s own spiritual condition and not being actively involved in the work of Jesus. Perhaps the biggest problem with sleep is being unaware that one is asleep! But the good news is Jesus still patiently knocks at the door of the heart. Have you let Him in? What did Felix do when he was convicted? “And as he reasoned of righteousness, temperance, and judgment to come, Felix trembled, and answered, Go thy way for this time; when I have a convenient season, I will call for thee.” —Acts 24:25 “For he saith, I have heard thee in a time accepted, and in the day of salvation have I succoured thee: behold, now is the accepted time; behold, now is the day of salvation.” —2 Corinthians 6:2 When the Holy Spirit convicts it is not wise to ignore it or put it off to a more convenient time because that time may never come. Tomorrow is not guaranteed; today is the day to get right with God.",

      "body": "What did Jesus promise prior to His crucifixion? “Let not your heart be troubled: ye believe in God, believe also in me. In my Father’s house are many mansions: if it were not so, I would have told you. I go to prepare a place for you. And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again, and receive you unto myself; that where I am, there ye may be also.” —John 14:1-3 When Jesus speaks, His word cannot fail; it will be fulfilled. Just as light appeared when He said, “Let there be light,” we can be just as certain that Jesus is coming back for His people to take them to heaven with Him—simply because He said so. How will He come back? “And when he had spoken these things, while they beheld, he was taken up; and a cloud received him out of their sight. And while they looked stedfastly toward heaven as he went up, behold, two men stood by them in white apparel; which also said, Ye men of Galilee, why stand ye gazing up into heaven? this same Jesus, which is taken up from you into heaven, shall so come in like manner as ye have seen him go into heaven.” —Acts 1:9-11 Jesus will return in a visible, bodily, and personal manner, just as He left. In other words, He will come literally—in a body of flesh and bones. Will it be possible to miss His coming? “Behold, he cometh with clouds; and every eye shall see him, and they also which pierced him: and all kindreds of the earth shall wail because of him. Even so, Amen.” —Revelation 1:7 “For as the lightning cometh out of the east, and shineth even unto the west; so shall also the coming of the Son of man be.” —Matthew 24:27 “Our God shall come, and shall not keep silence: a fire shall devour before him, and it shall be very tempestuous round about him.” —Psalm 50:3 “For the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the archangel, and with the trump of God: and the dead in Christ shall rise first.” —1 Thessalonians 4:16 Contrary to the popular but unbiblical teaching of a secret rapture, Christ’s second coming will be anything but silent or secret. It will be, in fact, the most awe-inspiring, thunderous, and radiant event in Earth’s history—utterly impossible to miss. Proponents of the secret rapture theory believe the rapture will be followed by a seven-year tribulation, during which those who were not taken to heaven will have another opportunity to repent and be saved. But offering such a second chance makes God appear arbitrary and unfair, granting one group a new opportunity for salvation while denying it to others. Furthermore, the theory provides false security to those who wish to continue in sin, as they may presume they can repent during the tribulation. How devastating will it be when they realize there is no second chance and that they have squandered the only one they had? Luke 17:34-36 is often cited as biblical evidence of a secret rapture, yet the context shows that Jesus was referring to the judgments in the days of Noah and Lot (Luke 17:26-29). In each case, a few were “taken” to safety while the rest were “left” to be destroyed: Noah and his family escaped safely in the ark, while Lot and his daughters fled the doomed city. Jesus warned that the same pattern will be repeated at His coming (Luke 17:30): the saved will be gathered to meet Him in the air (1 Thessalonians 4:16-17), while the lost will be destroyed by the brightness of His coming (2 Thessalonians 2:8). What else will take place? “For the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the archangel, and with the trump of God: and the dead in Christ shall rise first: then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air: and so shall we ever be with the Lord.” —1 Thessalonians 4:16-17 The Bible teaches that those who have died in Christ will be resurrected, and together with the living who are ready for His return, will be caught up to meet Him in the air to spend a thousand years in heaven. Because He remains in the air and does not touch the earth, His coming will not be an earthly appearance, but one in the sky—an important detail that helps us identify counterfeit christs (Matthew 24:4-5). Put simply, if anyone—even an angel—appears on the earth and claims to be Christ, we can be certain this contradicts Scripture, for Paul plainly states that the redeemed will meet Jesus in the air, meaning He will remain in the clouds above the earth. This is confirmed by the two angels’ declaration at Christ’s ascension: “This same Jesus, which is taken up from you into heaven, shall so come in like manner as ye have seen him go into heaven” (Acts 1:11). In other words, just as He ascended into heaven, He will likewise descend from heaven at His Second Coming. What kind of bodies will the saved have? “Behold, I shew you a mystery; We shall not all sleep, but we shall all be changed, in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trump: for the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed. For this corruptible must put on incorruption, and this mortal must put on immortality. So when this corruptible shall have put on incorruption, and this mortal shall have put on immortality, then shall be brought to pass the saying that is written, Death is swallowed up in victory.” —1 Corinthians 15:51-54 “… we look for the Saviour, the Lord Jesus Christ: Who shall change our vile body, that it may be fashioned like unto his glorious body, according to the working whereby he is able even to subdue all things unto himself.” —Philippians 3:20-21 The redeemed—both the living and the resurrected—will receive new, perfect, glorified, and immortal bodies at Jesus’ coming. How will the saved respond? “And it shall be said in that day, Lo, this is our God; we have waited for him, and he will save us: this is the LORD; we have waited for him, we will be glad and rejoice in his salvation.” —Isaiah 25:9 Christ’s coming will either be the best day of one’s life or the worst. Those who have loved Him enough to surrender their hearts to Him and submit to His will, through the power of the Holy Spirit (1 Corinthians 6:11), will rejoice at His appearing because He has become their best Friend and Lord of their lives. How will the lost respond? “And the heaven departed as a scroll when it is rolled together; and every mountain and island were moved out of their places. And the kings of the earth, and the great men, and the rich men, and the chief captains, and the mighty men, and every bondman, and every free man, hid themselves in the dens and in the rocks of the mountains; and said to the mountains and rocks, Fall on us, and hide us from the face of him that sitteth on the throne, and from the wrath of the Lamb: for the great day of his wrath is come; and who shall be able to stand?” —Revelation 6:14-17 In contrast to those who are saved, the lost—who had a superficial Christianity that never moved beyond mere profession, never surrendering all that they had and were to Him (Matthew 7:21-23)—will experience no peace or joy at Christ’s coming. To them, His coming will be a terrifying experience, so much so that they will seek death rather than face their Creator. Because they have chosen to cling to sin, they will be destroyed by the brightness of His coming, for anyone who holds on to sin cannot live in the presence of a holy God. Sin will be destroyed by Christ one way or another, because it is a manifestation of selfishness, which has no place in His kingdom of love. The only question is: will we be destroyed with it? He can either purge us from our sins now (Malachi 3:3), as we invite Him to take over our lives, or He will purge us along with our sins at His coming. But how can we be washed now? By His Word! When we read the Bible, it begins to read us (Hebrews 4:2), bringing conviction that, if yielded to, will cleanse us from sin (Ephesians 5:26). But if we neglect it, that same conviction will come at His appearing—at which point it will be too late to do anything about it. Now is the time to come to know Christ through His Word and to be transformed by His grace. Why must the lost be kept out of heaven? “He answered and said unto them, He that soweth the good seed is the Son of man; the field is the world; the good seed are the children of the kingdom; but the tares are the children of the wicked one; the enemy that sowed them is the devil; the harvest is the end of the world; and the reapers are the angels. As therefore the tares are gathered and burned in the fire; so shall it be in the end of this world. The Son of man shall send forth his angels, and they shall gather out of his kingdom all things that offend, and them which do iniquity; and shall cast them into a furnace of fire: there shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth. Then shall the righteous shine forth as the sun in the kingdom of their Father. Who hath ears to hear, let him hear.” —Matthew 13:37-43 “Nevertheless we, according to his promise, look for new heavens and a new earth, wherein dwelleth righteousness.” —2 Peter 3:13 “And there shall in no wise enter into it any thing that defileth, neither whatsoever worketh abomination, or maketh a lie: but they which are written in the Lamb’s book of life.” —Revelation 21:27 Because heaven is a place where righteousness dwells, anyone who clings to sin cannot be happy there. Excluding those who have repeatedly resisted God’s wooing grace and chosen to persist in sin is, in fact, an act of mercy toward the unconverted, for heaven would be a place of torment to those who have no longing for righteousness. It also secures the eternal peace and happiness of the citizens of God’s everlasting kingdom, for the removal of sin means the end of the pain, suffering, and misery that it always brings. Will there be a third group of people? “He that is unjust, let him be unjust still: and he which is filthy, let him be filthy still: and he that is righteous, let him be righteous still: and he that is holy, let him be holy still. And, behold, I come quickly; and my reward is with me, to give every man according as his work shall be.” —Revelation 22:11-12 “When the Son of man shall come in his glory, and all the holy angels with him, then shall he sit upon the throne of his glory: and before him shall be gathered all nations: and he shall separate them one from another, as a shepherd divideth his sheep from the goats: and he shall set the sheep on his right hand, but the goats on the left.” —Matthew 25:31-33 When Jesus returns, there will be only two groups of people—the saved and the lost. By then, it will be too late to change sides, for He will return with His reward, showing that judgment has already taken place and every case has been decided. In fact, the citizens of God’s eternal kingdom will have been determined when probation closes, which happens before His Second Coming—just as the door of Noah’s ark was shut seven days before the rain began (Genesis 7:10). How is Jesus portrayed when He returns? “And I saw heaven opened, and behold a white horse; and he that sat upon him was called Faithful and True, and in righteousness he doth judge and make war. His eyes were as a flame of fire, and on his head were many crowns; and he had a name written, that no man knew, but he himself. And he was clothed with a vesture dipped in blood: and his name is called The Word of God. And the armies which were in heaven followed him upon white horses, clothed in fine linen, white and clean. And out of his mouth goeth a sharp sword, that with it he should smite the nations: and he shall rule them with a rod of iron: and he treadeth the winepress of the fierceness and wrath of Almighty God. And he hath on his vesture and on his thigh a name written, KING OF KINGS, AND LORD OF LORDS.” —Revelation 19:11-16 Because He has triumphed over Satan, Jesus will return as the victorious King, accompanied by the innumerable host of His angelic army. What happens to the earth and the lost? “And the seventh angel poured out his vial into the air; and there came a great voice out of the temple of heaven, from the throne, saying, It is done. And there were voices, and thunders, and lightnings; and there was a great earthquake, such as was not since men were upon the earth, so mighty an earthquake, and so great. And the great city was divided into three parts, and the cities of the nations fell: and great Babylon came in remembrance before God, to give unto her the cup of the wine of the fierceness of his wrath. And every island fled away, and the mountains were not found. And there fell upon men a great hail out of heaven, every stone about the weight of a talent: and men blasphemed God because of the plague of the hail; for the plague thereof was exceeding great.” —Revelation 16:17-21 “I beheld the earth, and, lo, it was without form, and void; and the heavens, and they had no light. I beheld the mountains, and, lo, they trembled, and all the hills moved lightly. I beheld, and, lo, there was no man, and all the birds of the heavens were fled. I beheld, and, lo, the fruitful place was a wilderness, and all the cities thereof were broken down at the presence of the LORD, and by his fierce anger. For thus hath the LORD said, The whole land shall be desolate; yet will I not make a full end.” —Jeremiah 4:23-27 “And then shall that Wicked be revealed, whom the Lord shall consume with the spirit of his mouth, and shall destroy with the brightness of his coming: even him, whose coming is after the working of Satan with all power and signs and lying wonders, and with all deceivableness of unrighteousness in them that perish; because they received not the love of the truth, that they might be saved.” —2 Thessalonians 2:8-10 “And the slain of the LORD shall be at that day from one end of the earth even unto the other end of the earth: they shall not be lamented, neither gathered, nor buried; they shall be dung upon the ground.” —Jeremiah 25:33 The Bible teaches that just before Christ’s return, during the outpouring of the seven last plagues described in Revelation 16, the earth will be utterly devastated and rendered uninhabitable. Those of the lost who survive the plagues will be slain by the brightness of His glory, and since Christ will take the redeemed to heaven, the earth will, for the first time since creation week, be completely devoid of all life. This desolation makes the belief in an earthly millennium following Christ’s return an impossibility. Could it be that part of the reason the earth is completely destroyed at Christ’s coming is that it was being worshiped? What invitation does Revelation give us? “And the Spirit and the bride say, Come. And let him that heareth say, Come. And let him that is athirst come. And whosoever will, let him take the water of life freely. … He which testifieth these things saith, Surely I come quickly. Amen. Even so, come, Lord Jesus.” —Revelation 22:17, 20 “Behold, I stand at the door, and knock: if any man hear my voice, and open the door, I will come in to him, and will sup with him, and he with me.” —Revelation 3:20 “But as many as received him, to them gave he power to become the sons of God, even to them that believe on his name.” —John 1:12 “While it is said, Today if ye will hear his voice, harden not your hearts, as in the provocation.” —Hebrews 3:15 One day the door of mercy will close forever; one day the summer will end and the harvest will pass (Jeremiah 8:20). People will then run to and fro seeking salvation, but it will be too late (Amos 8:11-12). There is no reason to end in such a tragedy, yet there is not a moment to lose (Matthew 24:44; Luke 21:34-35). Today is the day of salvation.",

      "body": "How does the Bible describe the beast? “And I stood upon the sand of the sea, and saw a beast rise up out of the sea, having seven heads and ten horns, and upon his horns ten crowns, and upon his heads the name of blasphemy. And the beast which I saw was like unto a leopard, and his feet were as the feet of a bear, and his mouth as the mouth of a lion: and the dragon gave him his power, and his seat, and great authority. ““And I saw one of his heads as it were wounded to death; and his deadly wound was healed: and all the world wondered after the beast. And they worshipped the dragon which gave power unto the beast: and they worshipped the beast, saying, Who is like unto the beast? who is able to make war with him? And there was given unto him a mouth speaking great things and blasphemies; and power was given unto him to continue forty and two months. And he opened his mouth in blasphemy against God, to blaspheme his name, and his tabernacle, and them that dwell in heaven. ““And it was given unto him to make war with the saints, and to overcome them: and power was given him over all kindreds, and tongues, and nations. And all that dwell upon the earth shall worship him, whose names are not written in the book of life of the Lamb slain from the foundation of the world. If any man have an ear, let him hear. He that leadeth into captivity shall go into captivity: he that killeth with the sword must be killed with the sword. Here is the patience and the faith of the saints.” —Revelation 13:1-10 “Here is wisdom. Let him that hath understanding count the number of the beast: for it is the number of a man; and his number is six hundred threescore and six.” —Revelation 13:18 Before identifying the mark of the beast, we must first identify the beast itself. The Bible gives 11 characteristics: 1. It rises out of the sea (Revelation 13:1), 1. It is the composite of the four beasts of Daniel 7 (Revelation 13:2), 1. The dragon gives it power and authority (Revelation 13:2), 1. It receives a deadly wound (Revelation 13:3), 1. Its deadly wound is healed (Revelation 13:3), 1. It becomes a strong political power (Revelation 13:3, 7), 1. It becomes a strong religious power (Revelation 13:3, 8), 1. It speaks blasphemy against God (Revelation 13:1, 5, 6), 1. It wars against the saints and overcomes them (Revelation 13:7), 1. It rules for 42 months (Revelation 13:5), 1. It has the mysterious number of 666 (Revelation 13:18). What power is represented here? The Bible often operates on the principle of repetition where previously covered subjects are repeated and new details added. If some of these characteristics described in Revelation 13 sound familiar it’s because the beast described here is the same power as the little horn of Daniel 7, which we previously learned represents the papacy. Now it’s worth repeating that this is not a condemnation of Roman Catholics; rather, the Bible is pointing out a system—Catholicism. In other places the Bible also points out the faults of the Jewish and Protestant faiths. Moreover, God has devoted Christians in all churches, including the Roman Catholic church. It’s also true that the papacy has done many good deeds for the poor and the needy, but she has also committed serious errors that the Bible clearly points out in Daniel and in Revelation. God must sometimes chasten and rebuke because He wants us to be aware of error and compromise, and people who are truly loyal to Him will heed His warnings, no matter the faith. With this in mind, let’s examine each of the 11 characteristics: 1. It rises out of the sea. We previously learned that waters represent densely populated areas (Revelation 17:15), and since the papacy arose in Rome, Italy—a peninsula in the heart of Western Europe—it fits this point. 1. It is the composite of the four beasts of Daniel 7. The beast is the composite of these beasts (Daniel 7:4-7) because it incorporates various beliefs and practices from all four empires, and the papacy fits this point too. “In a certain respect, she [the papacy] has copied her organization from that of the Roman Empire, has preserved and made fruitful the philosophical intuitions of Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle, borrowed from both Barbarians and the Byzantine Roman Empire, but always remains herself, thoroughly digesting all elements drawn from external sources.” 1. The dragon gives it power and authority. The dragon can be identified by reading Revelation 12:1-6 where it talks about a pregnant woman about to deliver and the dragon hoping to devour the baby at birth; however, the child evades the dragon by being caught up to heaven. This is an obvious reference to Jesus, whom Herod tried to kill by slaying all the babies in Bethlehem (Matthew 2:16). Herod was acting under his authority as a king of Rome, so the dragon represents pagan Rome, but the real power behind Herod’s plot was the devil (Revelation 12:7-9) who likes to act through various governments to move his ugly work forward. The Roman Empire eventually fell in 476, and its power and capital city were inherited by the papacy. “The Roman Church … pushed itself into the place of the Roman World-Empire, of which it is the actual continuation. … The Pope … is Caesar’s successor.” “The mighty Catholic Church was little more than the Roman Empire baptised. Rome was transformed as well as converted. The very capital of the old Empire became the capital of the Christian Empire. The office of Pontifex Maximus was continued in that of Pope.” 1. It receives a deadly wound. This prophecy was fulfilled when Napoleon’s general, Alexander Berthier, took Pope Pius VI captive in 1798. When the pope died in 1799, “half Europe thought … that without the Pope the Papacy was dead.” 1. Its deadly wound is healed. The power and influence of the papacy has been increasing steadily over the years, and today she is not only one of the most powerful religious organizations in the world, but she has strong political influence as well. When the wound is completely healed, Revelation 13:3 says the entire world will give homage to it. 1. It becomes a strong political power. Revelation 13:7 says the papacy will have political power and influence over all of the nations of the world. The papacy’s political rise started when Italian dictator Benito Mussolini signed a treaty with the Vatican establishing it as a political state and protecting it from interference by the Italian government. Even though Vatican City is the smallest country in the world, it now has ambassadors (called “papal nuncios”) in every part of the globe. In 1984, it established diplomatic relations with the United States, and in 2015 Pope Francis spoke to a joint session of the U.S. Congress for the first time ever. No doubt, the wound has been healing. 1. It becomes a strong religious power. Revelation 13:8 says the papacy will be worshiped, which implies religious power and influence, by the entire world. Today the pope is respected by faiths across the religious spectrum. In 2014 Francis led an ecumenical worship service that was attended by Anglican, Lutheran, Methodist, and Orthodox representatives. He has also hosted a prayer summit at the Vatican with Israeli and Palesinian leaders. Cardinal Timothy Dolan had this to say: “The more he tries to de-emphasize the prestige and the power of the papacy, … the more people pay attention to him.” 1. It speaks blasphemy against God. Blasphemy is defined as claiming to forgive sins (Luke 5:21) and claiming to be God (John 10:33). The papacy fits these points because her priests claim to forgive sins and the popes claim to be Vicars of Christ. 1. It wars against the saints and overcomes them. The papacy persecuted and killed millions of people during the Dark Ages for following their conscience. 1. It rules for 42 months. The papacy ruled for 42 prophetic months, which equates to 1,260 years, from 538 to 1798. During this time the papacy had power to persecute and kill anyone who followed the Bible over its own traditions, and as a result, many had to flee their native countries or even escape into the wilderness. This was clearly foretold in Revelation 12:6, 14 and vividly fulfilled, for example, in the history of the Huguenots who fled France and the Waldensians who escaped into the Cottian Alps because they refused to compromise with the unbiblical teachings of the Roman Catholic Church. 1. It has the mysterious number of 666. Revelation 13:8 refers to it as “the number of a man,” and Revelation 15:2 says “the number of his name.” What is the official name of the pope? According to a Catholic quote: “The title of the pope of Rome is Vicarius Filii Dei.” The Douay versions of the Bible have a footnote for Revelation 13:8 that says, “The numeral letters of his name shall make up this number.” Notice that when the Roman numeral values of the letters of the pope’s official name are added up they equal 666 (note that V and U each equal five in Roman numerals). <br“|V|I|C|A|R|I|U|S| |F|I|L|I|I| |D|E|I| |-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-| |5|1|100|0|0|1|5|0| |0|1|50|1|1| |500|0|1| By the way, the Latin title “Vicarius Filii Dei” means “substitute of Son of God,” which is an echo of the word “antichrist,” which can be translated as “in place of God.” To summarize, there is no other power in history that could fit all 11 of these identifiers apart from the papacy, and only God could have prophesied this in advance.

What is God’s sign of authority? “Moreover also I gave them my sabbaths, to be a sign between me and them, that they might know that I am the LORD that sanctify them.” —Ezekiel 20:12 “Wherefore the children of Israel shall keep the sabbath, to observe the sabbath throughout their generations, for a perpetual covenant. It is a sign between me and the children of Israel for ever: for in six days the LORD made heaven and earth, and on the seventh day he rested, and was refreshed.” —Exodus 31:16-17 “Remember the sabbath day, to keep it holy. Six days shalt thou labour, and do all thy work: but the seventh day is the sabbath of the LORD thy God: in it thou shalt not do any work, thou, nor thy son, nor thy daughter, thy manservant, nor thy maidservant, nor thy cattle, nor thy stranger that is within thy gates. For in six days the LORD made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that in them is, and rested the seventh day: wherefore the LORD blessed the sabbath day, and hallowed it.” —Exodus 20:8-11 The fourth commandment about the Sabbath contains the three basic elements of a seal: the name (the Lord), title (your God), and territory (heaven and earth), so the seventh day Sabbath is a sign of God as the Creator of the universe, as well as the Sanctifier of those who choose to follow Him. It represents His authority to rule as Creator and Savior. Revelation 7:1-3 says that in the last days His servants will have the seal of God, the Sabbath, on their foreheads, which represents the mind (Hebrews 10:16), meaning they’ve made a decision to surrender their lives to Jesus—to follow Him as the authority over their lives because He created and saved them. Hebrews 4:4-10 says there remains a rest day for those who entered His rest (received salvation); this rest day is a symbol of salvation because we can stop trying to be saved by our works and rest in the righteousness of Jesus instead! The words seal, mark, sign, and token are used interchangeably in the Bible (Genesis 17:11; Ezekiel 9:4; Romans 4:11; Revelation 7:3). What does the papacy say is her mark of authority? Notice the following excerpts from Catholic catechisms: “Question: Have you any other way of proving that the Church has power to institute festivals of precept? Answer: Had she not such power, she could not have done that in which all modern religionists agree with her—she could not have substituted the observance of Sunday the first day of the week, for the observance of Saturday the seventh day, a change for which there is no Scriptural authority.” “Question: Why do we observe Sunday instead of Saturday? Answer: We observe Sunday instead of Saturday because the Catholic Church transferred the solemnity from Saturday to Sunday.” Here is another quote: “The church is above the Bible, and this transference of Sabbath observance is proof of that fact.” Cardinal Gibbons (a cardinal is a senior officer in the Catholic Church) had this to say about Sunday-keeping: “Of course the Catholic Church claims that the change was her act. It could not have been otherwise, as none in those days would have dreamed of doing anything, in matters spiritual, ecclesiastical and religious without her. This act is a mark of her ecclesiastical power and authority in religious matters.” The papacy itself is saying that it “changed” the Sabbath from Saturday to Sunday, the pagan day of sun worship, and virtually all churches accepted the new holy day. Therefore, it claims that this act is the mark of her power and authority. Stephen Keenan, A Doctrinal Catechism [FRS No. 7.], (3rd American ed., rev.: New York, Edward Dunigan & Bro., 1876), p. 174. Peter Geiermann, The Convert’s Catechism of Catholic Doctrine (St. Louis, B. Herder Book Co., 1957 ed.), p. 50. The Catholic Record (London, Ontario, Canada, Sept. 1, 1923). Extract from a letter written by the Chancellor of Cardinal Gibbons (November 11, 1895). Did God predict this attempted change? “And he shall speak great words against the most High, and shall wear out the saints of the most High, and think to change times and laws: and they shall be given into his hand until a time and times and the dividing of time.” —Daniel 7:25 We learned previously that one of the characteristics of the papacy would be trying to change times and laws. With regard to changing laws, in her catechisms she has removed the second commandment prohibiting the veneration of images, shortened the fourth commandment about the seventh Sabbath so that it could refer to any day, and divided the tenth commandment into two. Regarding changing times, she has attempted to change the time of the Sabbath from the seventh day to the first, as well as the timing of the Sabbath hours themselves—from sundown Friday night to sundown Saturday night as God commanded (Leviticus 23:32)) to the pagan Roman custom of counting the day from midnight to midnight. Of course, none of these changes are legitimate, because there is only one Lawgiver (James 4:12), and His word cannot change (Matthew 24:35). What question does the papacy asks Protestants? “You will tell me that Saturday was the Jewish Sabbath, but that the Christian Sabbath has been changed to Sunday. Changed! But by whom? Who has authority to change an express commandment of Almighty God? When God has spoken and said, Thou shalt keep holy the seventh day, who shall dare to say, Nay, thou mayest work and do all manner of worldly business on the seventh day; but thou shalt keep holy the first day in its stead? This is a most important question, which I know not how you can answer. “You are a Protestant, and you profess to go by the Bible and the Bible only; and yet in so important a matter as the observance of one day in seven as a holy day, you go against the plain letter of the Bible, and put another day in the place of that day which the Bible has commanded. The command to keep holy the seventh day is one of the Ten Commandments; you believe that the other nine are still binding; who gave you authority to tamper with the fourth? If you are consistent with your own principles, if you really follow the Bible and the Bible only, you ought to be able to produce some portion of the New Testament in which this fourth commandment is expressly altered.” “You may read the Bible from Genesis to Revelation, and you will not find a single line authorizing the sanctification of Sunday. The Scriptures enforce the religious observance of Saturday, a day which [Catholics] never sanctify.” Library of Christian Doctrine: Why Don’t You Keep Holy the Sabbath-Day? (London: Burns and Oates, Ltd.), pp. 3, 4. James Cardinal Gibbons, The Faith of Our Fathers, 93rd edition, 1917, p. 58. What warnings does God give regarding His law? “For the priest’s lips should keep knowledge, and they should seek the law at his mouth: for he is the messenger of the LORD of hosts. But ye are departed out of the way; ye have caused many to stumble at the law; ye have corrupted the covenant of Levi, saith the LORD of hosts. Therefore have I also made you contemptible and base before all the people, according as ye have not kept my ways, but have been partial in the law.” —Malachi 2:7-9 “That this is a rebellious people, lying children, children that will not hear the law of the LORD: which say to the seers, See not; and to the prophets, Prophesy not unto us right things, speak unto us smooth things, prophesy deceits.” —Isaiah 30:9-10 “The earth mourneth and fadeth away, the world languisheth and fadeth away, the haughty people of the earth do languish. The earth also is defiled under the inhabitants thereof; because they have transgressed the laws, changed the ordinance, broken the everlasting covenant. Therefore hath the curse devoured the earth, and they that dwell therein are desolate: therefore the inhabitants of the earth are burned, and few men left.” —Isaiah 24:4-6 “Her priests have violated my law, and have profaned mine holy things: they have put no difference between the holy and profane, neither have they shewed difference between the unclean and the clean, and have hid their eyes from my sabbaths, and I am profaned among them. … Therefore have I poured out mine indignation upon them; I have consumed them with the fire of my wrath: their own way have I recompensed upon their heads, saith the Lord GOD.” —Ezekiel 22:26, 31 God warns religious leaders who ignore His law and say that some commandments do not matter because such actions cause many people to stumble, but He also warns people who do not desire to learn about the law and want smooth fables to be preached, instead. Why? Because changing or refusing to follow God’s law has real consequences, including tragedy and upheaval on the earth. And this is not because God delights in heartache and misery, but because His law of love is there to protect from it. When it’s continually ignored, He will eventually stop pleading and let the consequences of rebellion play out. God cares about the truth being preached because He does not want anyone to be deceived, and so Ezekiel warns that those who teach there is no difference between sacred things, such as God’s holy day, and common things, such as Sunday, will one day face His indignation. Is the mark on the forehead visible? “And he causeth all, both small and great, rich and poor, free and bond, to receive a mark in their right hand, or in their foreheads.” —Revelation 13:16 “Therefore shall ye lay up these my words in your heart and in your soul, and bind them for a sign upon your hand, that they may be as frontlets between your eyes.” —Deuteronomy 11:18 “This is the covenant that I will make with them after those days, saith the Lord, I will put my laws into their hearts, and in their minds will I write them.” —Hebrews 10:16 “Whatsoever thy hand findeth to do, do it with thy might; for there is no work, nor device, nor knowledge, nor wisdom, in the grave, whither thou goest.” —Ecclesiastes 9:10 The forehead is the location of the frontal lobe, the area of the brain responsible for decision making, and in the Bible it represents the mind. When God told the Israelites to place His law on their foreheads He wanted the law to be in their minds. Likewise, the mark of the beast in the forehead (mind) is a decision to keep Sunday due to a conviction that it’s holy. Regarding being marked on the hand, in the Bible the hand represents work, so it’s accepting Sunday-keeping though one’s actions for practical reasons (convenience, job, family), not because of a conviction that it’s holy. In other words, the mark of the beast is a marking of oneself by accepting the beast’s mark, Sunday, either through conviction or actions, as opposed to God’s seal, the true seventh day Sabbath. Even though it’s not an obvious physical mark, God will know who has His seal and who has the beast’s mark (2 Timothy 2:19). Does anyone have the mark of the beast now? “And he causeth all, both small and great, rich and poor, free and bond, to receive a mark in their right hand, or in their foreheads: and that no man might buy or sell, save he that had the mark, or the name of the beast, or the number of his name.” —Revelation 13:16-17 No one will have the mark of the beast until Sunday worship is enforced by law. A time will come when the issue of Sunday worship will be so prominent that those who don’t go along will be cut off from the financial system, unable to buy or sell. When Sunday keeping is enforced by law that is when those who worship on the papacy’s counterfeit holy day will receive her mark, but those who follow Jesus and obey Him will worship on Satuday, His holy Sabbath day, and receive His mark. But waiting until the end to keep the true Sabbath is a mistake. Anyone who hopes to refuse the beasts’s mark in the future should keep Jesus’ true Sabbath now, and whoever decides to obey Him will receive His power to do so (Acts 5:32). Without Him, I can do nothing (John 15:5), but with Him all things are possible (Mark 10:27). What message does God give the world in the last days? “If thou turn away thy foot from the sabbath, from doing thy pleasure on my holy day; and call the sabbath a delight, the holy of the LORD, honourable; and shalt honour him, not doing thine own ways, nor finding thine own pleasure, nor speaking thine own words: then shalt thou delight thyself in the LORD; and I will cause thee to ride upon the high places of the earth, and feed thee with the heritage of Jacob thy father: for the mouth of the LORD hath spoken it.” —Isaiah 58:13-14 “Saying with a loud voice, Fear God, and give glory to him; for the hour of his judgment is come: and worship him that made heaven, and earth, and the sea, and the fountains of waters.” —Revelation 14:7 “And the third angel followed them, saying with a loud voice, If any man worship the beast and his image, and receive his mark in his forehead, or in his hand, the same shall drink of the wine of the wrath of God, which is poured out without mixture into the cup of his indignation; and he shall be tormented with fire and brimstone in the presence of the holy angels, and in the presence of the Lamb.” —Revelation 14:9-10 God is asking His people to stop trampling on His holy day so He can bless them; in fact, the Sabbath itself is a blessing and a delight to those who keep it. Obviously, it’s an important issue to God, so much so that the three-point message He gives to all the earth in the last days (Revelation 14:6-11) begins with a call to worship God, the Creator, and it’s then culminated by a prominent warning against worshiping the beast and receiving his mark because it will be a life-or-death issue. The conflict between God and Lucifer started in heaven over the issue of worship because Lucifer wanted to be worshiped like the Creator God, and it’s clear that worship will be central in the last days too. Will I worship the Creator God by observing His Sabbath or the beast by observing his counterfeit Sunday? Some may think it’s just a day, but it was also just a fruit that Adam and Eve ate in the garden of Eden. The day reveals the condition of the heart—either one that’s completely surrendered to Jesus or one that’s in rebellion against Him. What is the highest form of worship? “Know ye not, that to whom ye yield yourselves servants to obey, his servants ye are to whom ye obey; whether of sin unto death, or of obedience unto righteousness?” —Romans 6:16 “If ye love me, keep my commandments.” —John 14:15 “Here is the patience of the saints: here are they that keep the commandments of God, and the faith of Jesus.” —Revelation 14:12 The highest form worship is obedience; whom we obey is whom we worship and serve. Love for Jesus is made evident by a willingness to obey Him. The saints who refuse to worship the beast and receive his mark will do it only because of their deep love for Jesus, which will be clearly manifested in their obedience to His Sabbath day. Is it possible to worship God falsely? “Not everyone who says to Me, “Lord, Lord,” shall enter the kingdom of heaven, but he who does the will of My Father in heaven. Many will say to Me in that day, “Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied in Your name, cast out demons in Your name, and done many wonders in Your name?” And then I will declare to them, “I never knew you; depart from Me, you who practice lawlessness!”” —Matthew 7:21-23, NKJV “This people draweth nigh unto me with their mouth, and honoureth me with their lips; but their heart is far from me. But in vain they do worship me, teaching for doctrines the commandments of men.” —Matthew 15:8-9 “And he said unto them, Full well ye reject the commandment of God, that ye may keep your own tradition.” —Mark 7:9 “For as the body without the spirit is dead, so faith without works is dead also. People can claim to worship God, but their trampling of God’s law (lawlessness) will tell a different story because their deeds will be contrary to their profession. Any worship of God that elevates man-made laws above and contrary to the law of God is false worship, and it’s especially dangerous when this is propogated by a religious system. Now this isn’t anything new, or exclusive to Roman Catholicism, because the Jewish leaders of Jesus’ day were guilty of it too. Anyone, regardless of his or her faith, can fall into it, because the human heart is deceitful and hard to decipher (Jeremiah 17:9). That’s why James says that faith without works (obedience) is dead. While I’m not saved by my obedience (salvation is only by the righteousness of Jesus), obedience is evidence that I am saved, and it’s primarily evidence for me because God already knows the true condition of my heart (Psalm 139:23-24). Who did John see in God’s eternal kingdom? “Saying, Hurt not the earth, neither the sea, nor the trees, till we have sealed the servants of our God in their foreheads. And I heard the number of them which were sealed: and there were sealed an hundred and forty and four thousand of all the tribes of the children of Israel.” —Revelation 7:3-4 “And I saw as it were a sea of glass mingled with fire: and them that had gotten the victory over the beast, and over his image, and over his mark, and over the number of his name, stand on the sea of glass, having the harps of God.” —Revelation 15:2 “These are they which were not defiled with women; for they are virgins. These are they which follow the Lamb whithersoever he goeth. These were redeemed from among men, being the firstfruits unto God and to the Lamb.” —Revelation 14:4 Those who have refused the mark of the beast and have God’s seal, instead, will be in God’s eternal kingdom. Notice also that while the mark of the beast is either in the forehead or the hand, the seal of God is only placed in the forehead, meaning God is looking for allegiance only from those who are truly sincere in their worship of Him on His holy day. What does Jesus say about following Him? “And other sheep I have, which are not of this fold: them also I must bring, and they shall hear my voice; and there shall be one fold, and one shepherd. … My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me.” —John 10:16, 27 “Then spake Jesus again unto them, saying, I am the light of the world: he that followeth me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life.” —John 8:12 “Thy word is a lamp unto my feet, and a light unto my path.” —Psalm 119:105 Jesus has His people in all faiths, and when they learn about His truth, they will recognize His voice calling out to them and will follow Him, no matter the cost. It may be a difficult decision to make, but the promise from Jesus is that those who follow Him will be blessed with the eternal light of truth that brings fullness of life right now (John 10:10)! This is why Paul and Silas were able to sing praises to God while in prison for their faith (Acts 16:23-25); even though their feet were shackled and their backs lacerated, their souls were filled with the enduring joy that is found only in Jesus!",

In my Father’s house are many mansions: if it were not so, I would have told you. I go to prepare a place for you. And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again, and receive you unto myself; that where I am, there ye may be also.” —John 14:1-3 “And when he had spoken these things, while they beheld, he was taken up; and a cloud received him out of their sight. And while they looked stedfastly toward heaven as he went up, behold, two men stood by them in white apparel; which also said, Ye men of Galilee, why stand ye gazing up into heaven? this same Jesus, which is taken up from you into heaven, shall so come in like manner as ye have seen him go into heaven.” —Acts 1:9-11 Jesus said He was going to heaven to prepare a place for His followers—promising that He would come again to take them to be with Him there. This promise was reaffirmed by the two angels who appeared to His disciples at His ascension. They said that Jesus would return in the same bodily and personal manner as they had seen Him go into heaven. What will happen during Jesus’ second coming? “For the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the archangel, and with the trump of God: and the dead in Christ shall rise first: then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air: and so shall we ever be with the Lord.” —1 Thessalonians 4:16-17 “I am he that liveth, and was dead; and, behold, I am alive for evermore, amen; and have the keys of hell and of death.” —Revelation 1:18 “And there were voices, and thunders, and lightnings; and there was a great earthquake, such as was not since men were upon the earth, so mighty an earthquake, and so great. And the great city was divided into three parts, and the cities of the nations fell: and great Babylon came in remembrance before God, to give unto her the cup of the wine of the fierceness of his wrath. And every island fled away, and the mountains were not found. And there fell upon men a great hail out of heaven, every stone about the weight of a talent: and men blasphemed God because of the plague of the hail; for the plague thereof was exceeding great.” —Revelation 16:18-21 Because Jesus conquered death, all who have accepted His great sacrifice on their behalf and have died in Him will be resurrected at His coming. Together with the righteous who remain alive, they will be taken up to live with Him in heaven, never to be separated from Him again. The earth, on the other hand, will be devastated by the most catastrophic earthquake and hailstorm since creation. Revelation says that the hailstones will each weigh about a talent—about 75 pounds—and that the earthquake will cause the islands and mountains to move out of their places. How will the lost experience His coming? “For the Lord thy God is a consuming fire, even a jealous God.” —Deuteronomy 4:24 “In flaming fire taking vengeance on them that know not God, and that obey not the gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ.” —2 Thessalonians 1:8 “And then shall that Wicked be revealed, whom the Lord shall consume with the spirit of his mouth, and shall destroy with the brightness of his coming: even him, whose coming is after the working of Satan with all power and signs and lying wonders, and with all deceivableness of unrighteousness in them that perish; because they received not the love of the truth, that they might be saved.” —2 Thessalonians 2:8-10 Because sin cannot exist in the presence of a holy God, the second coming will be a consuming fire to all who have rejected Jesus’ sacrifice on their behalf. Their rejection means they have never confessed their sins to Him, leaving Him unable to forgive and cover them with His perfect righteousness. As a result, they must bear the penalty for their sins themselves—the wages of which is death (Romans 6:23). How does Jesus cleanse us from sin? “How much more shall the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered himself without spot to God, purge your conscience from dead works to serve the living God?” —Hebrews 9:14 “When the Lord shall have washed away the filth of the daughters of Zion, and shall have purged the blood of Jerusalem from the midst thereof by the spirit of judgment, and by the spirit of burning.” —Isaiah 4:4 “And such were some of you: but ye are washed, but ye are sanctified, but ye are justified in the name of the Lord Jesus, and by the Spirit of our God.” —1 Corinthians 6:11 To reject Jesus is to reject the convictions of the Holy Spirit upon the mind, through whom He works to purge us from sin. This is why the two travelers to Emmaus felt their hearts “burning” with conviction after Jesus explained the Scriptures to them (Luke 24:32). It also explains why the Holy Spirit appeared in the form of fire when He came upon the apostles at Pentecost (Acts 2:3-4). Because the lost have rejected the promptings of the Holy Spirit, the second coming will bring destruction upon them, for Christ’s glorious holiness is a consuming fire to all whose sins have not already been purged by the indwelling presence of His Holy Spirit (Psalm 50:3-4). What happens to Satan at this time? “And I saw an angel come down from heaven, having the key of the bottomless pit and a great chain in his hand. And he laid hold on the dragon, that old serpent, which is the Devil, and Satan, and bound him a thousand years. And cast him into the bottomless pit, and shut him up, and set a seal upon him, that he should deceive the nations no more, till the thousand years should be fulfilled: and after that he must be loosed a little season. … And when the thousand years are expired, Satan shall be loosed out of his prison.” —Revelation 20:1-3, 7 The chain described here is a symbolic chain of circumstances, representing Satan’s confinement to the desolate earth, where he will have no one to tempt or deceive—for the saved will be in heaven, and the lost will be dead. For the first time since his rebellion in heaven, he will be completely deprived of his power—a condition that will last for a thousand years. It is noteworthy that the Greek word translated “bottomless pit” is abussos (abyss)—the same word used in Genesis 1:2 for “deep”. In other words, during this period, the earth will return to a chaotic, uninhabited state similar to its condition before Creation. Who else is bound with him? “For if God spared not the angels that sinned, but cast them down to hell, and delivered them into chains of darkness, to be reserved unto judgment.” —2 Peter 2:4 “And it shall come to pass in that day, that the LORD shall punish the host of the high ones that are on high, and the kings of the earth upon the earth. And they shall be gathered together, as prisoners are gathered in the pit, and shall be shut up in the prison, and after many days shall they be visited.” —Isaiah 24:21-22 The fallen angels under Satan’s command—whom he first persuaded, by deception, to join his rebellion against God in heaven—will also be confined to the desolate earth with him. They will have ample time to reflect on their actions as they behold the devastation surrounding them—a constant reminder of the woeful consequences their rebellion has brought. By the way, the parallels between Isaiah 24:21-22 and Revelation 20:1-3 are remarkable. Both passages use the words “pit” and “prison” and refer to an extended period of time: “when the thousand years are expired, Satan shall be loosed out of his prison,” and “after many days shall they be visited.” Together, they provide a textbook example of allowing Scripture to interpret itself, for the “many days” in Isaiah correspond to the thousand years in Revelation. What happens to the lost? “And the slain of the LORD shall be at that day from one end of the earth even unto the other end of the earth: they shall not be lamented, neither gathered, nor buried; they shall be dung upon the ground.” —Jeremiah 25:33 The brightness of Jesus’ coming—His glorious and holy presence—will destroy the lost, who will remain dead for the entire millennium. Contrary to the popular secret rapture theory, which teaches that the lost will have a second chance to repent, they will have no such opportunity—for they will be dead, and the door of mercy will have closed forever. What happens to planet Earth? “And the seventh angel poured out his vial into the air; and there came a great voice out of the temple of heaven, from the throne, saying, It is done. And there were voices, and thunders, and lightnings; and there was a great earthquake, such as was not since men were upon the earth, so mighty an earthquake, and so great. And the great city was divided into three parts, and the cities of the nations fell: and great Babylon came in remembrance before God, to give unto her the cup of the wine of the fierceness of his wrath. And every island fled away, and the mountains were not found. And there fell upon men a great hail out of heaven, every stone about the weight of a talent: and men blasphemed God because of the plague of the hail; for the plague thereof was exceeding great.” —Revelation 16:17-21 “Therefore I will shake the heavens, and the earth shall remove out of her place, in the wrath of the LORD of hosts, and in the day of his fierce anger.” —Isaiah 13:13 “I beheld the earth, and, lo, it was without form, and void; and the heavens, and they had no light. I beheld the mountains, and, lo, they trembled, and all the hills moved lightly. I beheld, and, lo, there was no man, and all the birds of the heavens were fled. I beheld, and, lo, the fruitful place was a wilderness, and all the cities thereof were broken down at the presence of the LORD, and by his fierce anger. For thus hath the LORD said, The whole land shall be desolate; yet will I not make a full end.” —Jeremiah 4:23-27 The destruction at Jesus’ second coming will return the earth to its original state—a dark, barren place, unsuitable for life (Genesis 1:2). The fact that the earth will actually be moved from its current position likely explains why the heavens will have no light. Will Christ establish an earthly millennium? “Jesus answered, My kingdom is not of this world: if my kingdom were of this world, then would my servants fight, that I should not be delivered to the Jews: but now is my kingdom not from hence.” —John 18:36 “And when he was demanded of the Pharisees, when the kingdom of God should come, he answered them and said, The kingdom of God cometh not with observation: neither shall they say, Lo here! or, lo there! for, behold, the kingdom of God is within you.” —Luke 17:21-21 “For when they shall say, Peace and safety; then sudden destruction cometh upon them, as travail upon a woman with child; and they shall not escape.” —1 Thessalonians 5:3 Scripture’s portrayal of the earth’s desolation shows that the belief in an earthly millennium following Christ’s return (known as dispensational premillennialism) is unbiblical. Another view, postmillennialism, holds that Christ will return after a millennial period in which Christianity prevails—particularly at the governmental level—throughout the world. This perspective is often embraced by Christian nationalists, but it too is unbiblical, for Christ declared that His kingdom is not of this world. In fact, when describing the end of the world, Jesus never spoke of a period of universal peace; after warning of nations in distress and people’s hearts failing from fear, He went directly to His coming in glory (Luke 21:25-27). A heavenly millennium, therefore, is the only view that is consistent with all of Scripture. What do the saved do in heaven? “And I saw thrones, and they sat upon them, and judgment was given unto them: and I saw the souls of them that were beheaded for the witness of Jesus, and for the word of God, and which had not worshipped the beast, neither his image, neither had received his mark upon their foreheads, or in their hands; and they lived and reigned with Christ a thousand years.” —Revelation 20:4 “Do ye not know that the saints shall judge the world? and if the world shall be judged by you, are ye unworthy to judge the smallest matters? Know ye not that we shall judge angels? how much more things that pertain to this life?” —1 Corinthians 6:2-3 “And after these things I heard a great voice of much people in heaven, saying, Alleluia; Salvation, and glory, and honour, and power, unto the Lord our God: for true and righteous are his judgments.” —Revelation 19:1-2 The saved from all ages will participate in the next phase of judgment, during which all their questions about God’s dealings with sin and sinners will be answered. They will not determine who is saved or lost, for God will have already decided that during the first phase; rather, they will review the cases of all who are lost—including Satan and his angels. Perhaps they will wonder why some people they expected to be there are missing, while others they did not expect are present. Maybe certain perplexing events or trying circumstances in their own lives caused them to question why God allowed these things to happen. To all of these perplexities—and more—God will provide perfectly satisfying answers, confirming the fairness of His judgment and motivating the redeemed to praise Him all the more for His infinite wisdom, love, and mercy. What happens at the end of the millennium? “And I John saw the holy city, new Jerusalem, coming down from God out of heaven, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband.” —Revelation 21:2 “And his feet shall stand in that day upon the mount of Olives, which is before Jerusalem on the east, and the mount of Olives shall cleave in the midst thereof toward the east and toward the west, and there shall be a very great valley; and half of the mountain shall remove toward the north, and half of it toward the south. … and the LORD my God shall come, and all the saints with thee. … And the LORD shall be king over all the earth: in that day shall there be one LORD, and his name one.” —Zechariah 14:4-5, 9 “But the rest of the dead lived not again until the thousand years were finished.” —Revelation 20:5 “Marvel not at this: for the hour is coming, in the which all that are in the graves shall hear his voice, and shall come forth; they that have done good, unto the resurrection of life; and they that have done evil, unto the resurrection of damnation.” —John 5:28-29 Once the second phase of the judgment concludes at the end of the 1,000 years, Jesus will return to earth for the third time, bringing with Him all the redeemed and the glorious New Jerusalem. He will then level the Mount of Olives, creating a vast plain on which the city will rest. At that time, the second resurrection will occur—this time of the lost from all ages. Just as the resurrection of the saved marked the beginning of the millennium, so the resurrection of the lost will mark its close. For the first time in history, all who have ever lived since the creation of Adam and Eve will be gathered together—a vast, numberless multitude—for the third and final phase of the judgment. What happens to Satan? “And when the thousand years are expired, Satan shall be loosed out of his prison.” —Revelation 20:7 After the second resurrection, Satan will once again be free to deceive and manipulate the newly resurrected lost. What happens next? “And shall go out to deceive the nations which are in the four quarters of the earth, Gog and Magog, to gather them together to battle: the number of whom is as the sand of the sea. And they went up on the breadth of the earth, and compassed the camp of the saints about, and the beloved city.” —Revelation 20:8-9 “And I saw a great white throne, and him that sat on it, from whose face the earth and the heaven fled away; and there was found no place for them. And I saw the dead, small and great, stand before God; and the books were opened: and another book was opened, which is the book of life: and the dead were judged out of those things which were written in the books, according to their works.” —Revelation 20:11-12 “For there is nothing covered, that shall not be revealed; neither hid, that shall not be known. Therefore whatsoever ye have spoken in darkness shall be heard in the light; and that which ye have spoken in the ear in closets shall be proclaimed upon the housetops.” —Luke 12:2-3 As the lost behold the glories of the New Jerusalem and realize that they are shut out of it, Satan succeeds in deceiving them one final time, persuading them to surround the city in a desperate attempt to capture it. After all, among the lost are great military leaders from every age—commanders who have never known defeat. But suddenly God’s throne appears, halting their attack and inaugurating the final phase of the judgment. The wicked will then see the record of their lives unfold before them and recognize that God did everything possible to draw them to Himself—to save them from their sins and prepare them to dwell in His holy presence. Yet they resisted Him, and without the sacrifice of Jesus covering their sins, they are left to bear the penalty for their own sins. How will they respond? “For it is written, As I live, saith the Lord, every knee shall bow to me, and every tongue shall confess to God.” —Romans 14:11 “That at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of things in heaven, and things in earth, and things under the earth; and that every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father.” —Philippians 2:10-11 All the lost—including Satan, the original instigator of the long rebellion against God’s government—and his angels bow before God in acknowledgment that He has been perfectly just yet merciful, fair yet loving. All present—the saved and the lost, the fallen and unfallen angels, and even Satan himself—realize there was no justification or excuse for sin, and their confession settles the great controversy between good and evil in the minds of all, bringing it to a close. The universe can now be safely cleansed of the virus of sin, including all who, regrettably, chose to persistently cling to it. What then happens to the lost? “And they went up on the breadth of the earth, and compassed the camp of the saints about, and the beloved city: and fire came down from God out of heaven, and devoured them. And the devil that deceived them was cast into the lake of fire and brimstone, where the beast and the false prophet are, and shall be tormented day and night for ever and ever.” —Revelation 20:9-10 “And death and hell were cast into the lake of fire. This is the second death. And whosoever was not found written in the book of life was cast into the lake of fire.” —Revelation 20:14-15 “Say unto them, As I live, saith the Lord GOD, I have no pleasure in the death of the wicked; but that the wicked turn from his way and live: turn ye, turn ye from your evil ways; for why will ye die, O house of Israel?” —Ezekiel 33:11 What follows next is an act in which God takes no pleasure: fire will begin to fall from heaven upon the lost, Satan, and his angels, forming a lake of fire all around the New Jerusalem. This is the second death, from which there is no resurrection. For the God of love (1 John 4:8), this will be a painful experience to endure, because every person destroyed is one whom He created and loved more deeply than any parent could love a child. He did everything possible to save them, but they persistently rejected Him, leaving Him no other choice. The time has come to eradicate sin, for it cannot continue to exist unchecked, perpetuating pain, misery, and death throughout eternity. The Bible does not specify how long the fire will burn, but eventually it will go out, and when it does, the universe will at last be free from sin—forever (Nahum 1:9). What happens once the fire goes out? “For, behold, I create new heavens and a new earth: and the former shall not be remembered, nor come into mind.” —Isaiah 65:17 “Nevertheless we, according to his promise, look for new heavens and a new earth, wherein dwelleth righteousness.” —2 Peter 3:13 “And I saw a new heaven and a new earth: for the first heaven and the first earth were passed away; and there was no more sea. … And I heard a great voice out of heaven saying, Behold, the tabernacle of God is with men, and he will dwell with them, and they shall be his people, and God himself shall be with them, and be their God. And God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes; and there shall be no more death, neither sorrow, nor crying, neither shall there be any more pain: for the former things are passed away.” —Revelation 21:1, 3-4 Once the last smoldering coal goes out, God will create a new heaven and a new earth—where righteousness dwells. Unlike the first creation, which no human eyes beheld, this second creation will be witnessed by all the redeemed. God will speak, and the barren earth will be transformed into a lush garden teeming with life (Psalm 33:6). Everything Adam and Eve lost—and more—will be restored, and the redeemed will live in the presence of God in perfect harmony, indescribable joy, and ever-deepening love for Him and for one another through the ceaseless ages of eternity.",

      "series": "A Prophetic Movement",
      "body": "What is one way God speaks to us? “I have also spoken by the prophets, and I have multiplied visions, and used similitudes, by the ministry of the prophets.” —Hosea 12:10 “Surely the Lord GOD will do nothing, but he revealeth his secret unto his servants the prophets.” —Amos 3:7 “Remember the former things of old: for I am God, and there is none else; I am God, and there is none like me, declaring the end from the beginning, and from ancient times the things that are not yet done, saying, My counsel shall stand, and I will do all my pleasure.” —Isaiah 46:9-10 God has chosen to use prophets to speak to humanity on His behalf; they share His messages and make His will known. Before significant events unfold, God reveals His intentions to the world through them, so that the human family is warned and prepared. For example, He used Noah to warn the world about the flood (2 Peter 2:5), while Jeremiah warned Israel about their 70-year captivity in Babylon (Jeremiah 25:11). Regarding the coming of the Messiah, Isaiah announced that Jesus would would be born of a virgin (Isaiah 7:14), Micah said He would be born in Bethlehem (Micah 5:2), and Daniel prophesied that He would be “cut off” or killed (Daniel 9:26). Later, God used John the Baptist to announce that His coming was near (John 1:23-27). After Jesus’ ascension, Paul announced that Jesus would return a second time (1 Thessalonians 4:16-17), and given the importance of His return, we can expect the gift of prophecy to be evident again in the last days to warn and prepare the world. What did Jesus warn about prophets? “And many false prophets shall rise, and shall deceive many. And because iniquity shall abound, the love of many shall wax cold. … For there shall arise false Christs, and false prophets, and shall shew great signs and wonders; insomuch that, if it were possible, they shall deceive the very elect.” —Matthew 24:11, 24 Jesus said there will be many false prophets in the last days deceiving people with signs and wonders. The working of miracles, therefore, is not sufficient evidence of a genuine prophet (Revelation 13:13-14; 16:14). But it’s important to note that Jesus did not say that all prophets will be false ones. Since He warned about false ones, there must be genuine ones too. Which false prophets are condemned? “There shall not be found among you anyone who makes his son or his daughter pass through the fire, or one who practices witchcraft, or a soothsayer, or one who interprets omens, or a sorcerer, or one who conjures spells, or a medium, or a spiritist, or one who calls up the dead. For all who do these things are an abomination to the Lord, and because of these abominations the Lord your God drives them out from before you” —Deuteronomy 18:10-12, NKJV The Bible specifically names the following types of false prophets: - One who practices witchcraft (fortune teller) - Soothsayer (astrologer) - One who interprets omens (uses charms) - Sorcerer (claims to contact the spirits of the dead) - One who conjures spells - Medium (claims to channel the spirits of the dead) - Spiritist (claims to talk to the dead) - Witch (mentioned in KJV, a psychic) The Bible clearly teaches that the dead cannot be contacted, and any supposed communication with the dead is an abomination to God because such communication is actually with evil spirits masquerading as the dead). What else does the Bible say about prophets? “Wherefore he saith, When he ascended up on high, he led captivity captive, and gave gifts unto men. … And he gave some, apostles; and some, prophets; and some, evangelists; and some, pastors and teachers; for the perfecting of the saints, for the work of the ministry, for the edifying of the body of Christ: till we all come in the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of God, unto a perfect man, unto the measure of the stature of the fulness of Christ: that we henceforth be no more children, tossed to and fro, and carried about with every wind of doctrine, by the sleight of men, and cunning craftiness, whereby they lie in wait to deceive; but speaking the truth in love, may grow up into him in all things, which is the head, even Christ.” —Ephesians 4:8, 11-15 “Now ye are the body of Christ, and members in particular. And God hath set some in the church, first apostles, secondarily prophets, thirdly teachers, after that miracles, then gifts of healings, helps, governments, diversities of tongues.” —1 Corinthians 12:27-28 “Wherefore tongues are for a sign, not to them that believe, but to them that believe not: but prophesying serveth not for them that believe not, but for them which believe.” —1 Corinthians 14:22 While a prophet can at times edify the public, Paul tells us that prophecy is one of Jesus’ gifts to His church intended to edify its members in their Christian walk as well as to equip them in the work of ministry to others. These gifts are vital to His church and will remain with her until Jesus returns. But it’s also important to emphasize that while the gift of prophecy is a tremendous blessing, it’s not meant to add to, replace, or minimize the Word of God (Revelation 22:18-19; Proverbs 30:5-6). It’s true that God has used prophets to clarify His Word, but He never used them to originate new beliefs that cannot be supported by the Bible. The genuine gift of prophecy always elevates, and is in harmony with, God’s Word (Matthew 4:4). Why is the gift of prophecy absent from most churches? “Her gates are sunk into the ground; he hath destroyed and broken her bars: her king and her princes are among the Gentiles: the law is no more; her prophets also find no vision from the LORD.” —Lamentations 2:9 When God’s people knowingly rebel against His holy law, He withdraws the prophetic gift because the gifts of the Spirit are for those who genuinely desire to live a life of complete surrender to Him—a life that’s in harmony with and in obedience to His teachings, summarized in His law (Matthew 22:36-40). This principle explains why God sent a prophet once His remnant church emerged in the 1800s that kept, and still keeps, all of His commandments, including the seventh-day Sabbath observed by Jesus. God also knows exactly when His people are in need of warning, counsel, and guidance, and when that time comes, He lovingly sends them a prophet to strengthen them (Proverbs 29:18). Who empowers prophets to speak on God’s behalf? “But the manifestation of the Spirit is given to every man to profit withal. For to one is given by the Spirit the word of wisdom; to another the word of knowledge by the same Spirit; to another faith by the same Spirit; to another the gifts of healing by the same Spirit; to another the working of miracles; to another prophecy; to another discerning of spirits; to another divers kinds of tongues; to another the interpretation of tongues. But all these worketh that one and the selfsame Spirit, dividing to every man severally as he will.” —1 Corinthians 12:7-11 “Knowing this first, that no prophecy of the scripture is of any private interpretation. For the prophecy came not in old time by the will of man: but holy men of God spake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost.” —2 Peter 1:20-21 Jesus gives the gift of prophecy through the Holy Spirit, who distributes it to His people as He wills. In his second epistle, Peter tells us that it’s the Spirit who enables and empowers God’s prophets to speak on His behalf. Will the gift of prophecy be evident in the last days? “And it shall come to pass afterward, that I will pour out my spirit upon all flesh; and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, your old men shall dream dreams, your young men shall see visions. And also upon the servants and upon the handmaids in those days will I pour out my spirit.” —Joel 2:28-29 This prophecy was partially fulfilled when the Holy Spirit was poured out during Pentecost (Acts 2:1-4), empowering Jesus’ disciples to take the good news of His great sacrifice for sinners to the entire world. The prophecy will be fully fulfilled in the last days when the Holy Spirit empowers Christ’s followers to warn and prepare the world for His glorious return. Does the Bible give more evidence? “And the dragon was wroth with the woman, and went to make war with the remnant of her seed, which keep the commandments of God, and have the testimony of Jesus Christ.” —Revelation 12:17 “And I fell at his feet to worship him. And he said unto me, See thou do it not: I am thy fellowservant, and of thy brethren that have the testimony of Jesus: worship God: for the testimony of Jesus is the spirit of prophecy.” —Revelation 19:10 The remnant of Revelation 12 is God’s church in the last days, and it has two characteristics: keeps God’s commandments and has the testimony of Jesus Christ, which, according to Revelation 19, is the spirit of prophecy. This is another clue that the gift of prophecy will be evident in the last days prior to Jesus’ return; in fact, it’s one of the identifying marks of the remnant church. Paul confirms this in 1 Corinthians 1:4-7 where he says that the church waiting for His return will not lack any of the gifts of the Spirit. Just as God sent John the Baptist to prepare the world for Jesus’ first coming, He will send the gift of prophecy to His last-day commandment-keeping church to prepare the world (and itself) for Jesus’ second coming. Incidentally, since the testimony of Jesus is the spirit of prophecy then the words of His prophets are special messages from Jesus to us. Bringing reproach upon His prophets is the same as bringing reproach upon Jesus because He is the One who sends them. What else does the Bible say about the gift of prophecy? “And they rose early in the morning, and went forth into the wilderness of Tekoa: and as they went forth, Jehoshaphat stood and said, Hear me, O Judah, and ye inhabitants of Jerusalem; believe in the LORD your God, so shall ye be established; believe his prophets, so shall ye prosper.” —2 Chronicles 20:20 “Quench not the Spirit. Despise not prophesyings. Prove all things; hold fast that which is good. Abstain from all appearance of evil.” —1 Thessalonians 5:19-22 God has urged His people not to despise the gift of prophecy; in fact, He has pronounced a blessing on those who believe the words of His prophets. In an echo of Jesus’ warning about false prophets, Paul also tells us to test all things so that we can accurately discern whether a prophet is genuine or false. How does God speak to His prophets? “And he said, Hear now my words: If there be a prophet among you, I the LORD will make myself known unto him in a vision, and will speak unto him in a dream.” —Numbers 12:6 “I speak with him face to face, Even plainly, and not in dark sayings; And he sees the form of the LORD. Why then were you not afraid To speak against My servant Moses?”” —Numbers 12:8, NKJV God speaks to His prophets through visions, dreams, and face to face. What is a characteristic of a true prophet? “And, behold, one like the similitude of the sons of men touched my lips: then I opened my mouth, and spake, and said unto him that stood before me, O my lord, by the vision my sorrows are turned upon me, and I have retained no strength. For how can the servant of this my lord talk with this my lord? for as for me, straightway there remained no strength in me, neither is there breath left in me. Then there came again and touched me one like the appearance of a man, and he strengthened me, and said, O man greatly beloved, fear not: peace be unto thee, be strong, yea, be strong. And when he had spoken unto me, I was strengthened, and said, Let my lord speak; for thou hast strengthened me.” —Daniel 10:16-19 “He hath said, which heard the words of God, which saw the vision of the Almighty, falling into a trance, but having his eyes open.” —Numbers 24:4 “It is not expedient for me doubtless to glory. I will come to visions and revelations of the Lord. I knew a man in Christ above fourteen years ago, (whether in the body, I cannot tell; or whether out of the body, I cannot tell: God knoweth;) such an one caught up to the third heaven. And I knew such a man, (whether in the body, or out of the body, I cannot tell: God knoweth;) How that he was caught up into paradise, and heard unspeakable words, which it is not lawful for a man to utter.” —2 Corinthians 12:1-4 During a vision from God the true prophet will have the following physical characteristics, although they may not be present all at once: - Initially losing physical strength (Daniel 10:17). - Later receiving supernatural strength (Daniel 10:18-19). - No breath in the body (Daniel 10:17). - Able to speak (Daniel 10:17). - Eyes wide open (Numbers 24:4). - Not being aware of earthly surroundings (2 Corinthians 12:1-4). What is another characteristic? “Also I heard the voice of the Lord, saying, Whom shall I send, and who will go for us? Then said I, Here am I; send me. And he said, Go, and tell this people, Hear ye indeed, but understand not; and see ye indeed, but perceive not.” —Isaiah 6:8-9 “Then the word of the LORD came unto me, saying, Before I formed thee in the belly I knew thee; and before thou camest forth out of the womb I sanctified thee, and I ordained thee a prophet unto the nations. Then said I, Ah, Lord GOD! behold, I cannot speak: for I am a child. But the LORD said unto me, Say not, I am a child: for thou shalt go to all that I shall send thee, and whatsoever I command thee thou shalt speak.” —Jeremiah 1:4-7 “Then answered Amos, and said to Amaziah, I was no prophet, neither was I a prophet’s son; but I was an herdman, and a gatherer of sycomore fruit: and the LORD took me as I followed the flock, and the LORD said unto me, Go, prophesy unto my people Israel.” —Amos 7:14-15 A genuine prophet is called to service by God. What is the third characteristic? “If there arise among you a prophet, or a dreamer of dreams, and giveth thee a sign or a wonder, and the sign or the wonder come to pass, whereof he spake unto thee, saying, Let us go after other gods, which thou hast not known, and let us serve them; thou shalt not hearken unto the words of that prophet, or that dreamer of dreams: for the LORD your God proveth you, to know whether ye love the LORD your God with all your heart and with all your soul. Ye shall walk after the LORD your God, and fear him, and keep his commandments, and obey his voice, and ye shall serve him, and cleave unto him.” —Deuteronomy 13:1-4 “And when they shall say unto you, Seek unto them that have familiar spirits, and unto wizards that peep, and that mutter: should not a people seek unto their God? for the living to the dead? To the law and to the testimony: if they speak not according to this word, it is because there is no light in them.” —Isaiah 8:19-20 The true prophet will always speak in harmony with and obedience to God’s will as revealed in His Word and in His commandments. Anyone speaking contrary to God’s will cannot be His prophet. What is the fourth characteristic? “The prophets that have been before me and before thee of old prophesied both against many countries, and against great kingdoms, of war, and of evil, and of pestilence. The prophet which prophesieth of peace, when the word of the prophet shall come to pass, then shall the prophet be known, that the LORD hath truly sent him.” —Jeremiah 28:8-9 The genuine prophet’s predictions always come to pass if they are not conditional. What is the fifth characteristic? “Beware of false prophets, which come to you in sheep’s clothing, but inwardly they are ravening wolves. Ye shall know them by their fruits. Do men gather grapes of thorns, or figs of thistles?” —Matthew 7:15-16 The life of a genuine prophet will reveal the character of Jesus and the fruits of the Spirit (Galatians 5:22-23). What is the final characteristic? “Beloved, believe not every spirit, but try the spirits whether they are of God: because many false prophets are gone out into the world. Hereby know ye the Spirit of God: every spirit that confesseth that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh is of God, and every spirit that confesseth not that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh is not of God: and this is that spirit of antichrist, whereof ye have heard that it should come; and even now already is it in the world.” —1 John 4:1-3 “And I, if I be lifted up from the earth, will draw all men unto me.” —John 12:32 The true prophet will lift up Jesus Christ and emphasize His centrality in all teachings because it’s His love that draws people to Himself. Anyone who denies Jesus’ atoning sacrifice on the cross as being sufficient to pay for all sins is not from God. How is the gift of prophecy manifested in the last days? In question eight we learned that the gift of prophecy will be evident in God’s remnant church, which emerged in the mid-1800s. In order to encourage the growing church, God called a young woman named Ellen Harmon, who later married and became Ellen White, and blessed her with the gift of prophecy, using her to instruct the church as it grew into a worldwide missionary movement. Her life, visions, and writings fulfilled every biblical test of a genuine prophet, and they are evidence that God is doing everything He can to ensure His people have all the encouragement they need in order to thrive in the closing moments of Earth’s history. Even though Ellen had little formal education, she went on to write dozens of books on a variety of subjects, including the Bible, health, education, parenting, Christian living, evangelism, and more. Her writing is so impactful that she has become the fourth most translated author of all time. Her book on having a saving relationship with Jesus, Steps to Christ, has been translated into more than 165 languages. The best way to get acquainted with her prophetic gift is to read her material for yourself, and it will become evident that her primary goal was to direct people to Jesus as their personal Savior and to the Bible as their only rule of faith and life. Some of her other popular works include a book about the conflict between good and evil called The Great Controversy, one about Christ’s famous sermon called Thoughts From the Mount of Blessing, a book about His parables called Christ’s Object Lessons, and a masterpiece about His life called The Desire of Ages. Her writings are saturated with references to the Bible, which is elevated at every opportunity and never contradicted. Many who have read her works have been greatly blessed, realizing that she was used by God to communicate His love and truth, thereby leading many into a closer relationship with Him. It could be you if you give her writings a try.",

      "body": "Jesus established His church upon what foundation? “And I say also unto thee, That thou art Peter, and upon this rock I will build my church; and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it.” —Matthew 16:18 “And did all drink the same spiritual drink: for they drank of that spiritual Rock that followed them: and that Rock was Christ.” —1 Corinthians 10:4 “For other foundation can no man lay than that is laid, which is Jesus Christ.” —1 Corinthians 3:11 “For the husband is the head of the wife, even as Christ is the head of the church: and he is the saviour of the body.” —Ephesians 5:23 Jesus established His church upon Himself—the Rock (Psalm 62:6). Paul makes it clear that Jesus is also the foundation as well as the head of the church. Moreover, He is the only Mediator between God and man (1 Timothy 2:5). The word used for Peter in Matthew 16:18 is “Petros,” which refers to a stone that can be moved around. Peter was a mere man who later ended up denying Christ (Matthew 26:69-75) and was rebuked by Paul (Galatians 2:11), so he could not be the foundation of the church. The word for “Rock” in Matthew 16:18 is “petra,” which refers to an immovable mass of rock—a solid foundation—Jesus Christ Himself (Ephesians 2:19-22; 1 Peter 2:5-7). Was there a church after His ascension? “Praising God, and having favour with all the people. And the Lord added to the church daily such as should be saved.” —Acts 2:47 “Then had the churches rest throughout all Judaea and Galilee and Samaria, and were edified; and walking in the fear of the Lord, and in the comfort of the Holy Ghost, were multiplied.” —Acts 9:31 “Not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together, as the manner of some is; but exhorting one another: and so much the more, as ye see the day approaching.” —Hebrews 10:25 After Jesus ascended to heaven, the church He established multiplied as it shared the truths it received from Christ with the world. Though it did not have an official denominational name, it was described as the body of Christ (Colossians 1:18). It was organized and included deacons, elders, and missionaries (1 Timothy 3:8-13; Titus 1:5-9; Acts 13:4-5). Paul encouraged believers to attend church—a practice that’s in harmony with the example set by Jesus Himself, who faithfully attended church every Sabbath (Luke 4:16). Attending church offers opportunities to encourage others, brings the blessings of community, enables the gospel to be shared more effectively, and enhances one’s own spiritual journey. How did Paul describe the church? “But if I tarry long, that thou mayest know how thou oughtest to behave thyself in the house of God, which is the church of the living God, the pillar and ground of the truth.” —1 Timothy 3:15 God’s church was characterized by a commitment to the truth taught by Jesus, not manmade traditions, customs, or doctrines. But Paul also warned about apostasy coming in that would lead to a falling away from the church Jesus established (2 Thessalonians 2:3), which occured roughly 300 years after the establishment of Christianity when pagan customs and teachings started to make inroads. How does Revelation describe God’s church in the last days? “And there appeared a great wonder in heaven; a woman clothed with the sun, and the moon under her feet, and upon her head a crown of twelve stars.” —Revelation 12:1 We learned in the previous lesson that a woman represents a church. A harlot represents an apostate church, while a pure woman represents God’s true church—the bride of Christ (Revelation 19:7-8; 2 Corinthians 11:2). In Revelation 12:1 we see a woman in stark contrast to the harlot of Revelation 17. She is clothed with the sun, which symbolizes Jesus and His righteousness (Psalm 84:11; Malachi 4:2), without which there is no salvation (Acts 4:12). This imagery illustrates Jesus’ desire for the church to radiate His glory to the world. The woman also has a moon under her feet, which has no light of its own, but reflects the light of the sun. This represents the sacrificial system of the Old Testament, which reflected the light of the Messiah to come (Hebrews 10:1). Her crown of 12 stars represents the work of the 12 disciples that crowned, or laid the foundation of, the New Testament church. What happens to the woman? “And she being with child cried, travailing in birth, and pained to be delivered. And there appeared another wonder in heaven; and behold a great red dragon, having seven heads and ten horns, and seven crowns upon his heads. And his tail drew the third part of the stars of heaven, and did cast them to the earth: and the dragon stood before the woman which was ready to be delivered, for to devour her child as soon as it was born. And she brought forth a man child, who was to rule all nations with a rod of iron: and her child was caught up unto God, and to his throne.” —Revelation 12:2-5 The woman is about to deliver a baby, representing Jesus, who would one day rule all nations with a rod of iron—a reference to Revelation 2:27 and Revelation 19:13-15, which points to Jesus coming to the defense of His people when He returns the second time. There’s a red dragon who tries to devour the baby as soon as it’s born, but it escapes and is caught up to God’s throne—a reference to Jesus’ ascension to heaven. The dragon represents Satan, working through pagan Rome, trying to kill Jesus at His birth through Herod’s decree to kill all the babies of Bethlehem (Matthew 2:16). What do the seven heads and ten horns represent? “And here is the mind which hath wisdom. The seven heads are seven mountains, on which the woman sitteth.” —Revelation 17:9 “And the ten horns out of this kingdom are ten kings that shall arise: and another shall rise after them; and he shall be diverse from the first, and he shall subdue three kings.” —Daniel 7:24 The dragon’s seven heads represent the seven hills of Rome, while the ten horns represent the 10 barbarian tribes that arose after the fall of the Roman Empire (Daniel 7:23-24) and eventually became the nations of modern Europe. Ultimately, the dragon represents Satan—working not just through pagan Rome, but the 10 nations that arose out of it—persecuting God’s people. It refers to the time Christians were persecuted by the Roman Empire after Christ’s ascension as well as the European nations cooperating with the papacy’s persecution during the Dark Ages. In the last days, the ten horns represent all the nations of the world aligning with spiritual Babylon in its fight against God’s followers (Revelation 16:14; 17:12-13). The reference to a third of the stars of heaven being cast down to earth points to the angels who supported Lucifer during his rebellion against God and were subsequently cast out of heaven (Revelation 12:9; Luke 10:18; Isaiah 14:12). What happens next? “And when the dragon saw that he was cast unto the earth, he persecuted the woman which brought forth the man child. And to the woman were given two wings of a great eagle, that she might fly into the wilderness, into her place, where she is nourished for a time, and times, and half a time, from the face of the serpent.” —Revelation 12:13 “And the woman fled into the wilderness, where she hath a place prepared of God, that they should feed her there a thousand two hundred and threescore days.” —Revelation 12:6 Once Satan was no longer able to attack Jesus personally, he shifted his focus to persecuting God’s church. He first used the Roman Empire to persecute her, but later he switched to apostasy, which led to a split (falling away). He then started working through the apostate Christian church to resume his persecution against the faithful church, but she was given wings, representing God’s protection (Exodus 19:4; Deuteronomy 32:11), so she could escape into the wilderness where she could preserve and live out God’s truths for “a time and times and half a time,” which is three and a half prophetic years or 1,260 literal years. Satan began working through papal Rome at this time. (Note that the time spent in the wilderness matches the 1,260 year period of papal dominance—538 to 1798.) The wilderness refers to solitary places (mountains, caves, forests, deserts, etc.) where God’s church could hide to escape being totally destroyed (Hebrews 11:37-38). The history and persecution of the Waldenses, Albigenses, and Huguenots, among many others, testifies to this reality. Millions died for their faith at the hands of the papacy, but God did not allow His church to be totally obliterated because the truth had to be preserved. God ensured that the doctrines of the apostolic church, which had entered this period of hiding, were preserved when the persecuted church came out of hiding. What does God call His end-time church? “And the dragon was wroth with the woman, and went to make war with the remnant of her seed, which keep the commandments of God, and have the testimony of Jesus Christ.” —Revelation 12:17 “Here is the patience of the saints: here are they that keep the commandments of God, and the faith of Jesus.” —Revelation 14:12 The word “remnant” refers to the last remaining portion of something, so in reference to God’s church, it points to His church in the last days. This church is then given two characteristics: she keeps the commandments of God, including the seventh-day Sabbath of the fourth commandment (John 14:15; Revelation 22:14), and has the testimony of Jesus, which is the spirit of prophecy (Revelation 19:10). Revelation 12:17 is an echo of Revelation 14:12, so the “testimony of Jesus Christ” can also refer to the faith and teachings of Jesus. Just as the remnant of a cloth has the same color and pattern as the original, the remnant church will return to the truths taught by Christ and believed by the original Christian church He established. Furthermore, in the previous question we learned that God’s church went into hiding from the year 538 to 1798, so even though the church was still alive, it did not exist as an official organization during that time. In other words, God’s last day, remnant church had to arise after 1798, but the process started during the great Protestant Reformation, which led to the Bible being translated into the common language so it could be read by all. Once that happened, the light of the gospel began to shine, and it would not be stopped—“the gates of hell shall not prevail against it” (Matthew 16:18). Is there anything else about the remnant church? “And I saw another angel fly in the midst of heaven, having the everlasting gospel to preach unto them that dwell on the earth, and to every nation, and kindred, and tongue, and people, Saying with a loud voice, Fear God, and give glory to him; for the hour of his judgment is come: and worship him that made heaven, and earth, and the sea, and the fountains of waters. And there followed another angel, saying, Babylon is fallen, is fallen, that great city, because she made all nations drink of the wine of the wrath of her fornication. And the third angel followed them, saying with a loud voice, If any man worship the beast and his image, and receive his mark in his forehead, or in his hand, the same shall drink of the wine of the wrath of God, which is poured out without mixture into the cup of his indignation; and he shall be tormented with fire and brimstone in the presence of the holy angels, and in the presence of the Lamb: and the smoke of their torment ascendeth up for ever and ever: and they have no rest day nor night, who worship the beast and his image, and whosoever receiveth the mark of his name. Here is the patience of the saints: here are they that keep the commandments of God, and the faith of Jesus.” —Revelation 14:6-12 The spirit of the Reformation continued through the centuries, leading to the establishment of God’s remnant that returned back to the teachings of the original church established by Jesus. This remnant church then preaches a three-point message, symbolized by the three angels of Revelation 14, that goes out to the entire world: 1. The first message calls people to fear God, which is an echo of Ecclesiastes 12:13-14 and a call to live a life of reverence for God that leads to keeping His commandments. It then calls people to give glory to Him, which is an echo of 1 Corinthians 10:31 and a call to live a life that glorifies Him in everything, including diet. The first message also announces that God’s judgment has already begun, and it calls people to worship Him as Creator (Revelation 4:11). This call to worship quotes the fourth commandment (Exodus 20:8-11), which identifies God as the Creator (Genesis 2:1-3) and invites people to worship Him as Creator by keeping His seventh-day Sabbath holy. 1. The second message calls people to come out of the fallen churches of spiritual Babylon. 1. The third message warns against worshiping the beast or receiving his mark, which is the observance of the papal Sunday in place of God’s true seventh-day Sabbath. Because this three-point message goes to the entire world, the remnant church must be a worldwide missionary church that preaches this three-point message. With the addition of the previously identified clues, we now have the following list of characteristics regarding the remnant church: 1. It would arise after 1798. 1. It would believe all the teachings of Jesus. 1. It would have the spirit of prophecy. 1. It would keep the commandments of God, including His seventh-day Sabbath. 1. It would be a worldwide missionary church. 1. It would be preaching the three angels’ messages of Revelation 14. How many churches fit these characteristics? “There is one body, and one Spirit, even as ye are called in one hope of your calling; one Lord, one faith, one baptism; one God and Father of all, who is above all, and through all, and in you all.” —Ephesians 4:4-6 “And other sheep I have, which are not of this fold: them also I must bring, and they shall hear my voice; and there shall be one fold, and one shepherd.” —John 10:16 The six characteristics above are specific enough that they fit only one church—the Seventh-day Adventist Church. Founded in 1863, it was born out of a desire to follow Jesus in accordance with the Bible alone; in this regard, it was a product and a continuation of the work of the Reformers. Being the only global organization preaching the three angels’ messages of Revelation 14, it’s committed to sharing the gospel of Jesus with the entire world. Moreover, according to Paul, God has one body of believers, not a multitude of churches that often present contradictory messages leading to confusion. He has His people in other churches, no doubt, which is why He’s calling them out (Revelation 18:4) and seeking to bring all of His followers together into His final church of the last days—into a unity that is based on the truths of His Word. The Greek word for “church” is “ekklesia,” and it literally means “called-out ones.” Just like there was only one way of escape in the time of Noah—the ark, Jesus has provided another kind of ark, the church, the pillar of truth (1 Timothy 3:15), to take His people safely through the closing moments of earth, and it’s absolutely crucial for every believer to be convinced, based on the Bible, that the church one attends meets the biblical criteria of God’s remnant church. What about the hypocrites in the church? “But go ye and learn what that meaneth, I will have mercy, and not sacrifice: for I am not come to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance.” —Matthew 9:13 “Husbands, love your wives, even as Christ also loved the church, and gave himself for it.” —Ephesians 5:25 The church is made of people, and people are not perfect. The church is more of a hospital for broken people whom Christ wants to heal and restore into His image. We are also called to be followers of Christ, not other Christians. Staying out of the church because of others was not what Jesus did. He faithfully attended church even though it was far from perfect, and despite the imperfect people there, Paul tells us that Jesus loves His church so much that He died for her (Ephesians 5:25). At the same time, Satan has not ceased his attack on God’s remnant church; he has just changed his tactics—from outright persecution in times past to a subtler strategy that is more inline with modern times, like discrediting her by spreading lies, but such actions are the very fulfillment of Revelation 12:17. To what kind of church does Jesus return? “That he might present it to himself a glorious church, not having spot, or wrinkle, or any such thing; but that it should be holy and without blemish.” —Ephesians 5:27 “But if I tarry long, that thou mayest know how thou oughtest to behave thyself in the house of God, which is the church of the living God, the pillar and ground of the truth.” —1 Timothy 3:15 “Here is the patience of the saints: here are they that keep the commandments of God, and the faith of Jesus.” —Revelation 14:12 “For this is the love of God, that we keep His commandments. And His commandments are not burdensome.” —1 John 5:3 The good news is that Jesus returns to a glorious church built on and in harmony with Bible truth, made up of faithful followers who refuse and separate from pagan teachings and traditions. They are known for their love of, loyalty to, and faith in Jesus, which is made evident in their obedience to His commandments. What invitation does the bride of Revelation give? “And the Spirit and the bride say, Come. And let him that heareth say, Come. And let him that is athirst come. And whosoever will, let him take the water of life freely.” —Revelation 22:17 In the last days everybody will be worshiping. Very soon there will be only two religions in the world: one worshiping and obeying Jesus and the other worshiping and obeying the dictates of man. Now is the time to follow Jesus’ call to come and be a part of His remnant church, of which He is the head (Colossians 1:18), to drink His eternal, life-giving truths, as revealed in His Word, and join in sharing His final message with the world.",

      "series": "The Second Coming",
      "body": "What is the first sign Jesus mentions? “And as he sat upon the mount of Olives, the disciples came unto him privately, saying, Tell us, when shall these things be? and what shall be the sign of thy coming, and of the end of the world? And Jesus answered and said unto them, Take heed that no man deceive you. For many shall come in my name, saying, I am Christ; and shall deceive many.” —Matthew 24:3-5 “For there shall arise false Christs, and false prophets, and shall shew great signs and wonders; insomuch that, if it were possible, they shall deceive the very elect.” —Matthew 24:24 “For such are false apostles, deceitful workers, transforming themselves into the apostles of Christ. And no marvel; for Satan himself is transformed into an angel of light.” —2 Corinthians 11:13-14 Jesus emphasizes that deception will not only be prevalent in the lead-up to His coming, but also powerful, as it will be accompanied by signs and wonders. Beyond people claiming to be false Christs, Satan himself can appear as an angel of light. Jim Jones and David Koresh are examples of false prophets who claimed to be Christ, but the danger runs even deeper than that. Over the past few decades, the New Age teachings of pantheism (all is God) and panentheism (God is in all) have been creeping into Christianity, leading some to believe that they are actually god. These teachings build upon the serpent’s original lie, “ye shall be as gods” (Genesis 3:5), and fulfill Christ’s prophecy that many would say, “I am Christ” (Matthew 24:5). Anyone who teaches that a human being can become god—or even Christ—spreads deception, because the truth is Jesus never promised us deity. He promised us eternal life (Romans 6:23), yes, but never deity. We are and will always be His created beings; He is our Creator God. Will there be a rise in skepticism? “Knowing this first, that there shall come in the last days scoffers, walking after their own lusts, and saying, Where is the promise of his coming? for since the fathers fell asleep, all things continue as they were from the beginning of the creation. For this they willingly are ignorant of, that by the word of God the heavens were of old, and the earth standing out of the water and in the water: whereby the world that then was, being overflowed with water, perished.” —2 Peter 3:3-6 “For the time will come when they will not endure sound doctrine; but after their own lusts shall they heap to themselves teachers, having itching ears; and they shall turn away their ears from the truth, and shall be turned unto fables.” —2 Timothy 4:3-4 It is incredible how Paul, after mentioning scoffers, goes back to the Genesis account—specifically the creation week, which identifies God as the Creator of the world, and the worldwide flood. A denial of both of these accounts lays the foundation for many false but widely held views today, such as Darwinian evolution, progressive creationism, and atheism. Perhaps the clearest example of the fulfillment of these verses, however, is the rise of higher criticism, which denies that the Bible is a divinely inspired book altogether. Efforts to undermine the authority of the Bible are alive in Christian churches too. Proponents of mysticism, for example, emphasize a subjective, experiential Christianity over one that is based on the objective and authoritative Word of God. This is a modern equivalent of another effort to undermine Scripture that reaches back thousands of years: the elevation of church tradition above Scripture, which, incidentally, was one of the rallying cries of the Reformation—sola scriptura (“Scripture alone”). What about spiritism? “Now the Spirit speaketh expressly, that in the latter times some shall depart from the faith, giving heed to seducing spirits, and doctrines of devils.” —1 Timothy 4:1 The interest in psychics, mediums, witchcraft, and the occult is as old as time, but it will intensify in the final days of earth’s history. Surprisingly, these practices are alive in Christianity as well through the meditative techniques of spiritual formation, which allegedly enable the practitioner to come into God’s presence—and even hear His voice—on demand. This is achieved through an altered state of consciousness, known as “entering the silence,” in which all thinking is suppressed, resulting in a trance-like, meditative state—the same state that witches, psychics, and channelers enter when they do their work. When this state is reached, the mind is opened to the influence of evil supernatural forces. The truth is God never asks us to suspend our reasoning powers when we pray or study His Word; on the contrary, He wants us to be fully engaged (Isaiah 1:18). (For more information, see Howard Peth’s book The Dangers of Contemplative Prayer.) What is another sign? “And ye shall hear of wars and rumours of wars: see that ye be not troubled: for all these things must come to pass, but the end is not yet. For nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom: and there shall be famines, and pestilences, and earthquakes, in divers places.” —Matthew 24:6-7 “All these are the beginning of birth pains.” —Matthew 24:8, NIV While wars, rumors of wars, famines, epidemics, and earthquakes have always existed, Jesus likened them to birth pains—which increase in frequency and intensity over time—to emphasize that these signs will follow the same pattern. Is there a surprising sign in Revelation? “And the nations were angry, and thy wrath is come, and the time of the dead, that they should be judged, and that thou shouldest give reward unto thy servants the prophets, and to the saints, and them that fear thy name, small and great; and shouldest destroy them which destroy the earth.” —Revelation 11:18 Humanity now possesses the power to destroy the earth—through weapons of mass destruction like the atomic bomb and by tampering with weather modification techniques like geoengineering. How will people feel about the future? “Men’s hearts failing them for fear, and for looking after those things which are coming on the earth: for the powers of heaven shall be shaken.” —Luke 21:26 Those without God as their anchor will find themselves in a fearful and anxious state as the world becomes increasingly chaotic. Such a state, on a societal level, makes people easy to control and manipulate—a fertile ground for tyranny and scapegoat-seeking narratives, which can easily lead to previously unimaginable atrocities. The Bible predicts this will happen just before Christ’s Second Coming. What sign does Paul give in one of his letters? “For yourselves know perfectly that the day of the Lord so cometh as a thief in the night. For when they shall say, Peace and safety; then sudden destruction cometh upon them, as travail upon a woman with child; and they shall not escape.” —1 Thessalonians 5:2-3 This is related to the previous sign of apprehension about the future, because as nations attempt to bring stability, they will make promises of peace and safety, but according to the Bible, the reality that follows will be the opposite. How will people treat each other? “And because iniquity shall abound, the love of many shall wax cold.” —Matthew 24:12 “This know also, that in the last days perilous times shall come. For men shall be lovers of their own selves, covetous, boasters, proud, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy, Without natural affection, trucebreakers, false accusers, incontinent, fierce, despisers of those that are good, traitors, heady, highminded, lovers of pleasures more than lovers of God; having a form of godliness, but denying the power thereof: from such turn away.” —2 Timothy 3:1-5 As the love of many grows cold, lawlessness will assert itself in society, driven by selfishness in the hearts of those who have rejected God. When the restraining power of God departs through persistent rejection (Romans 1:28), human behavior will begin to resemble that of the pre-flood world, when every thought was only evil continually (Genesis 6:5). But this trend will not be universal. Communities of genuine followers of Christ will exist throughout the world who reflect His character. Specifically, they will be known for their love—which is, in fact, the love of God manifested in them (John 13:35; 1 John 2:5). Thus, in the end, there will be only two classes of people: those who give themselves over to sin, selfishness, and evil, and those who give themselves over to God’s loving mercy and enabling grace. Whether we realize it or not, the decisions we make on a daily basis are bringing us closer to one of these groups. What will people be preoccupied with? “And take heed to yourselves, lest at any time your hearts be overcharged with surfeiting, and drunkenness, and cares of this life, and so that day come upon you unawares.” —Luke 21:34 “But as the days of Noe were, so shall also the coming of the Son of man be. For as in the days that were before the flood they were eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, until the day that Noe entered into the ark, and knew not until the flood came, and took them all away; so shall also the coming of the Son of man be.” —Matthew 24:37-39 Obviously, there is nothing wrong with marriage; after all, it was instituted and blessed by God Himself. Likewise, it is impossible to survive without nourishing our bodies; we must eat, which means we must work, and for the majority of people, work consumes the largest part of their lives. Most are busy trying to survive, so in the absence of intentionality, it is easy to become preoccupied with the temporal at the expense of the spiritual. Yet Christ’s words quietly ring in the background: “Seek ye first the kingdom of God, and his righteousness; and all these things shall be added unto you” (Matthew 6:33). In Noah’s days, most people ignored his invitations to come into the ark because they were too busy doing other things. Where do our priorities stand? Are there any socioeconomic signs? “Go to now, ye rich men, weep and howl for your miseries that shall come upon you. Your riches are corrupted, and your garments are motheaten. Your gold and silver is cankered; and the rust of them shall be a witness against you, and shall eat your flesh as it were fire. Ye have heaped treasure together for the last days. Behold, the hire of the labourers who have reaped down your fields, which is of you kept back by fraud, crieth: and the cries of them which have reaped are entered into the ears of the Lord of sabaoth. Ye have lived in pleasure on the earth, and been wanton; ye have nourished your hearts, as in a day of slaughter.” —James 5:1-5 The gap between rich and poor, coupled with corruption, fraud, and disputes between employers and workers, will continue to widen as we draw nearer to the coming of Christ. As the Holy Spirit is repeatedly resisted and withdrawn, people are left to the control of their carnal nature, whose chief aim has always been preservation and exaltation of self. What is one of the positive signs? “And this gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a witness unto all nations; and then shall the end come.” —Matthew 24:14 With the rapid advancement of communication technology over the past decades—such as television, radio, and the internet—the gospel is now being preached to even the remotest corners of the globe. What once seemed an impossible task has now become a reality. The Bible teaches that religious revivals—both genuine and counterfeit—will spread across the world, and religious discussions will take center stage, resonating through the legislative halls and judicial courtrooms of nations just prior to Christ’s return. Religion in general, and the enforcement of God’s law in particular, will be on everyone’s mind. What specific signs have already been fulfilled? “And I beheld when he had opened the sixth seal, and, lo, there was a great earthquake; and the sun became black as sackcloth of hair, and the moon became as blood; and the stars of heaven fell unto the earth, even as a fig tree casteth her untimely figs, when she is shaken of a mighty wind.” —Revelation 6:12-13 Before the heavenly judgment began in 1844, three specific signs were fulfilled in the exact sequence outlined in Revelation 6. The first (“a great earthquake”) was fulfilled by the Great Lisbon Earthquake of November 1, 1755. The shaking lasted for about six minutes and was so powerful that it was felt across Europe and North Africa, generating tsunami waves that reached as far as the Caribbean. Charles Lyell, a Scottish geologist, described the earthquake’s power: “In no part of the volcanic region of Southern Europe has so tremendous an earthquake occurred in modern times as that which began on the 1st of November, 1755, at Lisbon. A sound of thunder was heard underground, and immediately afterward a violent shock threw down the greater part of that city. In the course of about six minutes, sixty thousand persons perished. The sea first retired, and laid the bar dry; it then rolled in, rising fifty feet above its ordinary level. The mountains of Arrabida, Estrella, Julio, Marvan, and Cintra, being some of the largest in Portugal, were impetuously shaken, as it were from their very foundations; and some of them opened at their summits, which were split and rent in a wonderful manner, huge masses of them being thrown down into the subjacent valleys. Flames are related to have issued from these mountains, which are supposed to have been electric; they are also said to have smoked; but vast clouds of dust may have given rise to this appearance.” The second sign (“the sun became black as sackcloth of hair, and the moon became as blood”) was fulfilled by the New England Dark Day of May 19, 1780. The sun was so completely darkened that candles were required from noon onward, and later that evening, the moon appeared red. An eyewitness in Massachusetts described the scene: “Fear, anxiety, and awe gradually filled the minds of the people. Women stood at the door, looking out upon the dark landscape; men returned from their labor in the fields; the carpenter left his tools, the blacksmith his forge, the tradesman his counter. Schools were dismissed, and tremblingly the children fled homeward. Travelers put up at the nearest farmhouse. ‘What is coming?’ queried every lip and heart. It seemed as if a hurricane was about to dash across the land, or as if it was the day of the consummation of all things. Candles were used; and hearth fires shone as brightly as on a moonless evening in autumn…. Fowls retired to their roosts and went to sleep, cattle gathered at the pasture bars and lowed, frogs peeped, birds sang their evening songs, and bats flew about. But the human knew that night had not come.” The final sign (“the stars of heaven fell”) was fulfilled by the great Leonids meteor shower of November 13, 1833. Witnesses reported that the meteors fell like rain and that no language could describe their splendor. “Its sublimity and awful beauty still linger in many minds. … Never did rain fall much thicker than the meteors fell toward the earth; east, west, north, and south, it was the same. In a word, the whole heavens seemed in motion.” “No language, indeed, can come up to the splendor of that magnificent display; … no one who did not witness it can form an adequate conception of its glory. It seemed as if the whole starry heavens had congregated at one point near the zenith, and were simultaneously shooting forth, with the velocity of lightning, to every part of the horizon; and yet they were not exhausted—thousands swiftly followed in the tracks of thousands, as if created for the occasion.” Jesus prophesied that all three signs will occur again just prior to His Second Coming (Matthew 24:29-30; Mark 13:24-26; Luke 21:25).

Devens, American Progress; or, The Great Events of the Greatest Century, ch. 28, pars. 1-5. F. Reed, Christian Advocate and Journal, Dec. 13, 1833. What is God’s desire for the human race? “The Lord is not slack concerning his promise, as some men count slackness; but is longsuffering to us-ward, not willing that any should perish, but that all should come to repentance.” —2 Peter 3:9 “Say unto them, As I live, saith the Lord GOD, I have no pleasure in the death of the wicked; but that the wicked turn from his way and live: turn ye, turn ye from your evil ways; for why will ye die, O house of Israel?” —Ezekiel 33:11 God does not want anyone to be caught off guard or unprepared for His coming. His desire is that every person be saved, so He is patient with us, granting repeated opportunities and every spiritual blessing (Ephesians 1:3-4) we need to become His sons and daughters. Yet His patience is not infinite (Genesis 6:3), for if it were, the misery of sin would never end. One day, the door to reconciliation with our Maker will close forever. May it never be said of us: “The harvest is past, the summer is ended, and we are not saved” (Jeremiah 8:20). Let us make the most of every God-given opportunity and blessing. What advice and promise does the Bible give? “Watch therefore: for ye know not what hour your Lord doth come. But know this, that if the goodman of the house had known in what watch the thief would come, he would have watched, and would not have suffered his house to be broken up. Therefore be ye also ready: for in such an hour as ye think not the Son of man cometh.” —Matthew 24:42-44 “Watch ye therefore, and pray always, that ye may be accounted worthy to escape all these things that shall come to pass, and to stand before the Son of man.” —Luke 21:36 “I will say of the LORD, He is my refuge and my fortress: my God; in him will I trust. Surely he shall deliver thee from the snare of the fowler, and from the noisome pestilence. He shall cover thee with his feathers, and under his wings shalt thou trust: his truth shall be thy shield and buckler.” —Psalm 91:2-4 Those who watch for the signs of Christ’s coming and earnestly pray that He will prepare them for it will experience His unfailing faithfulness and enabling grace. If received and obeyed, His truth will protect them from deception, and He will be with them every step of the way, no matter what happens around them.",

He does not want anyone to be lost because of a lack of knowledge about eternal realities, so He often speaks through prophets to make these truths known to His people. John the Revelator is one such prophet, to whom God revealed events that will unfold near the close of earth’s history. What power is symbolized first in Revelation 13? “And I stood upon the sand of the sea, and saw a beast rise up out of the sea, having seven heads and ten horns, and upon his horns ten crowns, and upon his heads the name of blasphemy. And the beast which I saw was like unto a leopard, and his feet were as the feet of a bear, and his mouth as the mouth of a lion: and the dragon gave him his power, and his seat, and great authority. And I saw one of his heads as it were wounded to death; and his deadly wound was healed: and all the world wondered after the beast. And they worshipped the dragon which gave power unto the beast: and they worshipped the beast, saying, Who is like unto the beast? who is able to make war with him? And there was given unto him a mouth speaking great things and blasphemies; and power was given unto him to continue forty and two months. And he opened his mouth in blasphemy against God, to blaspheme his name, and his tabernacle, and them that dwell in heaven. ““And it was given unto him to make war with the saints, and to overcome them: and power was given him over all kindreds, and tongues, and nations. And all that dwell upon the earth shall worship him, whose names are not written in the book of life of the Lamb slain from the foundation of the world. If any man have an ear, let him hear. He that leadeth into captivity shall go into captivity: he that killeth with the sword must be killed with the sword. Here is the patience and the faith of the saints.” —Revelation 13:1-10 As we learned in a previous study, the beast that rose from the sea represents the Roman papacy, which held influence and power over the world for 42 months. The papacy received a deadly wound at the end of this period in 1798, when Pope Pius VI was taken captive by Napoleon Bonaparte’s general, Louis-Alexandre Berthier. By the way, the beast represented in Revelation 13:2 is a conglomerate of the four beasts described in Daniel 7:2-8, because Catholicism has adopted the works-based religion of Babylon, the Persian system of government (based on the structure of Mithraism), the philosophy of Greece (for example, natural law and the elevation of reason), and the legal system of Rome (for example, canon law). What power is symbolized next? “And I beheld another beast coming up out of the earth; and he had two horns like a lamb, and he spake as a dragon.” —Revelation 13:11 Revelation 13:10 refers to the papal captivity that occurred in 1798, and the second beast is seen emerging around the same time. There is only one power that fits this time frame—the United States. It declared its independence in 1776, adopted the Constitution in 1787, and ratified the Bill of Rights in 1791. By 1798, it was recognized as a rising global power. A key detail in verse 11 is that this power arises “out of the earth,” in contrast to the first beast, which came “out of the sea.” According to Revelation 17:15, the sea symbolizes large, densely populated areas; therefore, the earth represents the opposite—a sparsely populated region. This means the second beast could not emerge from the crowded nations of the Old World; instead, it had to rise from a less populated part of the world—perfectly matching the emergence of the United States. What makes the U.S. unique? “And I beheld another beast coming up out of the earth; and he had two horns like a lamb, and he spake as a dragon.” —Revelation 13:11 The lamb-like horns suggest youth and innocence, emphasizing that this would be a new nation. Horns, on the other hand, represent kings, kingdoms, or governing powers (Daniel 7:24; 8:21). In this case, they symbolize the two founding principles of the United States: civil and religious liberty. These principles have also been described as republicanism (a government without a king) and Protestantism (a church without a pope). Unlike other nations described in Daniel and Revelation, this one is distinguished by the absence of crowns, signifying a republican form of government as opposed to a monarchy. Throughout history, it was common for nations to tax citizens to support a state religion and to oppress religious dissenters. The Pilgrims on the Mayflower, along with many other settlers who followed, were fleeing religious persecution, and so the United States was founded with an entirely new mindset: the separation of church and state. This idea, first brought to prominence by the German princes at the Diet of Speyer in 1529, found its fullest expression more than 250 years later when, in 1791, the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution was adopted. Yet the princes were not its originators; they were merely echoing what Jesus had taught long before, when He declared, “Render to Caesar the things that are Caesar’s, and to God the things that are God’s” (Mark 12:17). In upholding liberty of conscience, Protestantism provided the world with a foundation upon which the future freedom, happiness, and well-being of society could be built. These two principles—civil and religious liberty—“are the secret of its [the United States'] power and prosperity. The oppressed and downtrodden throughout Christendom have turned to this land with interest and hope. Millions have sought its shores, and the United States has risen to a place among the most powerful nations of the earth.” —Ellen G. White, The Great Controversy, p. 441 Closely related to liberty of conscience is the authority of the Bible above that of the Church: “The principles contained in the celebrated Protest of the 19th of April, 1529, constitute the very essence of Protestantism. Now this Protest opposes two abuses of man in matters of faith: the first is the intrusion of the civil magistrate, and the second the arbitrary authority of the church. Instead of these abuses, Protestantism sets the power of conscience above the magistrate, and the authority of the word of God above the visible church. In the first place, it rejects the civil power in divine things, and says with the prophets and apostles, ‘We must obey God rather than man.’ In presence of the crown of Charles the Fifth, it uplifts the crown of Jesus Christ. But it goes farther: it lays down the principle that all human teaching should be subordinate to the oracles of God.” —Merle d’Aubigné, History of the Reformation, Book 13, Chapter 6, Paragraph 18. Will the U.S. experience a change? “And I beheld another beast coming up out of the earth; and he had two horns like a lamb, and he spake as a dragon.” —Revelation 13:11 Revelation 20:2 identifies the dragon as Satan, who uses various earthly powers to persecute and destroy God’s people (Revelation 12:13). Since his rebellion in heaven, Satan’s aim has been to be like God—to usurp His authority and compel people to worship him instead (Isaiah 14:12-14). So what does it mean for a nation to speak like a dragon? A nation “speaks” through its laws and legislative actions, so to speak like a dragon means that a time will come when the United States, under Satan’s influence, will enact laws enforcing false worship. Not only will this be an abandonment of the nation’s duty to protect liberty of conscience for all its citizens—and thus a repudiation of the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution—but it will also be an act of blasphemy, for it will assume authority that belongs only to God. As our Creator, God alone has the authority to prescribe our duties to Him, and He has done so with the Ten Commandments. To enforce these duties by coercion, even if it is claimed to be for the good of society, creates a society of hypocrites who obey outwardly while the heart remains unconverted—the exact opposite of what God desires in His followers (Deuteronomy 30:6; Ezekiel 36:26). The use of coercion has no power to regenerate the heart, and it is utterly repugnant to the God of love who gave Adam and Eve the freedom to walk away from Him—at infinite cost to Himself. Does the Bible give more details? “And he exerciseth all the power of the first beast before him, and causeth the earth and them which dwell therein to worship the first beast, whose deadly wound was healed. And he doeth great wonders, so that he maketh fire come down from heaven on the earth in the sight of men, and deceiveth them that dwell on the earth by the means of those miracles which he had power to do in the sight of the beast; saying to them that dwell on the earth, that they should make an image to the beast, which had the wound by a sword, and did live.” —Revelation 13:12-14 The United States will exercise all the authority of the first beast, the papacy, meaning it will imitate its actions, becoming a persecuting power that compels individuals to act against their conscience. The passage goes on to say that the United States will use its influence to lead other nations to do the same. Clearly, worship will be the central issue in the last days. Every individual will be faced with the question: Will I worship my Creator and Redeemer, Jesus Christ, or the antichrist? The call to align with the antichrist will appear genuinely spiritual, being backed by miracles that will deceive many. Religious fanaticism will run high, causing those who refuse to comply to be labeled divisive, stubborn, legalistic, and unpatriotic. Though this may seem shocking and outlandish, Jesus does not lie, and His words never fail (Titus 1:2). He reveals these things ahead of time so that when they do come to pass, we may believe (John 14:29). Any other details? “And deceiveth them that dwell on the earth by the means of those miracles which he had power to do in the sight of the beast; saying to them that dwell on the earth, that they should make an image to the beast, which had the wound by a sword, and did live. And he had power to give life unto the image of the beast, that the image of the beast should both speak, and cause that as many as would not worship the image of the beast should be killed.” —Revelation 13:14-15 Abandoning its foundational principle of church-state separation, the United States will instead form an unholy union between civil government and apostate Protestantism. In doing so, it will make an image to the beast by establishing a copy of the church-state system used by the papacy during the Middle Ages, when millions were killed for their faith. These actions will appear spiritual, patriotic, and beneficial to society, but they will be satanic in nature—fitly represented by the lamb-like beast (Revelation 13:11). With apostate Protestantism in control of the government, religious legislation will soon follow (Revelation 13:15). It will begin mildly but will eventually escalate, forcing people to comply or face persecution and, ultimately, death. Once this church-state union is formed domestically, the U.S. will pressure other nations to follow its example, leading the entire world to wonder after the beast (Revelation 13:3). There are a couple of additional details worth noting. The deceptive miracle-working described above is a religious activity, which means it is carried out by the apostate Protestant side of the church-state union. These miracles then empower the deception, persuading those who dwell on the earth to make an image to the beast. Notably, the image is made, indicating that it did not exist originally, so this can only apply to a nation that had no church-state union at its founding. Moreover, it is the people dwelling on the earth who make an image to the beast. This suggests a representative form of government, one that is “of the people, by the people, and for the people.” In other words, it will be the people, urged on by the apostate Protestant churches, who will demand religious laws from their representatives in Congress. Abraham Lincoln, Gettysburg Address, November 19, 1863. What will this ultimately lead to? “And he had power to give life unto the image of the beast, that the image of the beast should both speak, and cause that as many as would not worship the image of the beast should be killed. And he causeth all, both small and great, rich and poor, free and bond, to receive a mark in their right hand, or in their foreheads: and that no man might buy or sell, save he that had the mark, or the name of the beast, or the number of his name.” —Revelation 13:15-17 “And the dragon was wroth with the woman, and went to make war with the remnant of her seed, which keep the commandments of God, and have the testimony of Jesus Christ.” —Revelation 12:17 Worshiping and obeying the beast will result in receiving the mark of the beast through the keeping of Sunday as a false holy day, as opposed to worshiping and obeying Jesus and receiving His mark by keeping the seventh-day Sabbath. Those who choose to worship the beast will have chosen to obey the word of a human being rather than the word of their Creator, Jesus Christ. The papacy testifies to this itself: “The church changed Sabbath to Sunday and all the world bows down and worships upon that day in silent obedience to the mandates of the Catholic Church.” As the leader of the international movement to enforce allegiance to the papacy, the United States will proceed to punish those who refuse to comply with its Sunday legislation by denying them the ability to buy or sell. Eventually, it will impose a death sentence, which will become global. Despite all this, the Bible promises that God will protect His people, and their food and water will be sure (Isaiah 33:16; Psalm 34:7). Hartford Weekly Call, February 22, 1884. Has something similar happened in the past? “Nebuchadnezzar the king made an image of gold, whose height was threescore cubits, and the breadth thereof six cubits: he set it up in the plain of Dura, in the province of Babylon.” —Daniel 3:1 “Then the princes, the governors, and captains, the judges, the treasurers, the counsellers, the sheriffs, and all the rulers of the provinces, were gathered together unto the dedication of the image that Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up; and they stood before the image that Nebuchadnezzar had set up. Then an herald cried aloud, To you it is commanded, O people, nations, and languages. That at what time ye hear the sound of the cornet, flute, harp, sackbut, psaltery, dulcimer, and all kinds of musick, ye fall down and worship the golden image that Nebuchadnezzar the king hath set up: and whoso falleth not down and worshippeth shall the same hour be cast into the midst of a burning fiery furnace. Therefore at that time, when all the people heard the sound of the cornet, flute, harp, sackbut, psaltery, and all kinds of musick, all the people, the nations, and the languages, fell down and worshipped the golden image that Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up.” —Daniel 3:3-7 “Nebuchadnezzar spake and said unto them, Is it true, O Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, do not ye serve my gods, nor worship the golden image which I have set up?” —Daniel 3:14 “If it be so, our God whom we serve is able to deliver us from the burning fiery furnace, and he will deliver us out of thine hand, O king. But if not, be it known unto thee, O king, that we will not serve thy gods, nor worship the golden image which thou hast set up.” —Daniel 3:17-18 A very similar scenario played out in Babylon during the reign of Nebuchadnezzar. It also involved a universal command forcing all to worship an image, with the death penalty for those who refused. Most complied, but a small group of friends refused to compromise by violating God’s commandments. Their love for God was stronger than death (Revelation 12:11), and they chose to remain faithful to Him by His grace. Has the U.S. passed religious legislation before? In 1888, Senator Henry Blair proposed a bill that sought to establish Sunday as a national day of rest, which was fortunately defeated; nevertheless, a turning point came just four years later. In the landmark 1892 case Church of the Holy Trinity v. United States, the Supreme Court declared the United States a Christian nation, thereby setting a precedent that would justify future religious legislation. That same year, Congress passed legislation requiring the World’s Columbian Exposition to close on Sundays in honor of Sunday observance, a mandate endorsed by President Benjamin Harrison, who made government funding for the fair conditional on Sunday closure. As a result, only 101 years after the ratification of the First Amendment, which established the separation of church and state, all three branches of the United States government had effectively repudiated that principle. Today, many states already have “blue laws” that restrict commerce on Sundays, based on the Supreme Court’s 1961 ruling in McGowan v. Maryland, which held that such laws do not violate the First Amendment. This was done despite the 1797 Treaty of Tripoli—signed by President George Washington and approved by the U.S. Senate—which, in Article 11, declared that “the government of the United States is not in any sense founded upon the Christian religion.” How influential is the papacy? The papacy has emerged as the most powerful religio-political entity in the world. Nearly every major country maintains an official ambassador to the Vatican, including the United States. During Pope Francis’ 2015 visit to the U.S., President Obama personally welcomed him, with the White House describing the event as a symbol of the high level of respect America holds for the pontiff. The visit also marked the first time in American history that a pope addressed a joint session of Congress. In addition to its political influence, the papacy’s religious influence is likewise unparalleled, spanning across the religious spectrum. For instance, in 2014, Francis presided over an ecumenical worship service attended by representatives from the Orthodox, Anglican, Lutheran, Methodist, and other Christian traditions, during which he called for greater Christian unity. Throughout his pontificate, Francis has consistently sought to build bridges with those outside the Christian faith as well. Such efforts have elevated the papacy’s global influence—an influence that, according to Bible prophecy, will continue to grow in the days to come. Irish Daily Mail, September 23, 2015. Catholic Herald, January 27, 2014. Of course, there is nothing inherently wrong with unity. After all, Jesus teaches us to love our neighbors—even our enemies—and He prayed for unity among His disciples (Matthew 22:39; 5:44; John 17:11). Unity is indeed biblical, so long as it is not built on the compromise of truth as revealed in God’s Word. Unfortunately, this is often not the case. How influential is the U.S. today? Few would dispute that the United States is a global leader and a fulcrum of influence. Although it faces challenges to its power from countries such as China and Russia, it continues to dominate the global stage. “What ultimately makes the difference between war and peace … is not good intentions, or strong words, or a grand coalition. It is the capability, credibility, and global reach of American hard power.” “The United States is and remains the one indispensable nation. That has been true for the century past, and it will be true for the century to come.” Contrary to the belief that the United States will lose its elevated standing and become merely one among several strong nations, Bible prophecy indicates that this simply cannot be. The United States will remain a leading world power until the Second Coming of Christ.

Potential catalysts for global upheaval include terrorism, civil unrest, crime, a major economic collapse, epidemics, nuclear threats, political corruption, social inequality, judicial injustice, escalating immorality, and catastrophic natural disasters. Such crises could readily lead to calls for the enactment of drastic, previously unthinkable legislation in the United States—laws that could then be promoted globally under the banner of world peace and unity. However, this unity will likely be built on compromise and deception rather than on truth, and those who refuse to conform will likely be scorned and labeled as fanatics—as often happens in times of crisis when groupthink prevails. Ultimately, in the name of preserving peace and unity, eliminating such individuals will be considered a service to God, as foretold in John 16:2, by those who have become deluded through their persistent rejection of the truth (2 Thessalonians 2:10-12). Will there be a false religious revival? “And he doeth great wonders, so that he maketh fire come down from heaven on the earth in the sight of men, and deceiveth them that dwell on the earth by the means of those miracles which he had power to do in the sight of the beast; saying to them that dwell on the earth, that they should make an image to the beast, which had the wound by a sword, and did live.” —Revelation 13:13-14 “Then if any man shall say unto you, Lo, here is Christ, or there; believe it not. For there shall arise false Christs, and false prophets, and shall shew great signs and wonders; insomuch that, if it were possible, they shall deceive the very elect.” —Matthew 24:23-24 “And I saw three unclean spirits like frogs come out of the mouth of the dragon, and out of the mouth of the beast, and out of the mouth of the false prophet. For they are the spirits of devils, working miracles, which go forth unto the kings of the earth and of the whole world, to gather them to the battle of that great day of God Almighty.” —Revelation 16:13-14 As global conditions become increasingly unbearable, a worldwide movement calling for a return to God—centered on synchronized, family-focused, and environmentally conscious Sunday observance—will be promoted as the only solution. This movement will be accompanied by signs, wonders, and miracles performed through the power of Satan, resulting in a counterfeit revival in which every person will be urged—and eventually compelled—to participate by honoring the papacy’s counterfeit “holy” day in place of God’s true and holy seventh-day Sabbath, instituted at Creation. These signs and wonders will be so convincing that Satan will attempt to deceive even God’s own people. Fallen spirits (angels of Satan) could appear as deceased loved ones (Revelation 18:23), and possibly even as Bible prophets or apostles, claiming to be sent by God to promote unity and peace. The pressure to enforce Sunday legislation will be intense, and some—especially those indifferent to religion—may comply simply for economic, social, or even environmental reasons. It has become common in public discourse to dismiss—nay, to denigrate—God’s Sabbath by referring to it as the “Jewish Sabbath.” Yet the truth remains: there was not a single Jew in the Garden of Eden when God instituted it. What will be the crowning deception? “For such are false apostles, deceitful workers, transforming themselves into the apostles of Christ. And no marvel; for Satan himself is transformed into an angel of light. Therefore it is no great thing if his ministers also be transformed as the ministers of righteousness; whose end shall be according to their works.” —2 Corinthians 11:13-15 “Then if any man shall say unto you, Lo, here is Christ, or there; believe it not. For there shall arise false Christs, and false prophets, and shall shew great signs and wonders; insomuch that, if it were possible, they shall deceive the very elect.” —Matthew 24:23-24 “Ye are of your father the devil, and the lusts of your father ye will do. He was a murderer from the beginning, and abode not in the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he speaketh a lie, he speaketh of his own: for he is a liar, and the father of it.” —John 8:44 There will be reports of a dazzling angel claiming to be Jesus, but in reality, it will be Satan impersonating Him. The fallen angel could quote Scripture, perform miracles, and even claim to have changed the Sabbath to Sunday in order to urge the world to honor his counterfeit day. The Bible says the deception will be so effective that the whole world will be deceived by it (Revelation 13:3)—except for God’s true followers, who will test everything by Scripture (Isaiah 8:19-20; 2 Timothy 2:15). They will know that God’s law cannot change (Luke 16:17; 21:33). Moreover, they will recognize it is not Jesus, because according to the Bible, He will not touch the earth at His second coming but will remain in the clouds to meet His people in the air (1 Thessalonians 4:16-17). Will there be a genuine revival? “And I saw another angel fly in the midst of heaven, having the everlasting gospel to preach unto them that dwell on the earth, and to every nation, and kindred, and tongue, and people, saying with a loud voice, Fear God, and give glory to him; for the hour of his judgment is come: and worship him that made heaven, and earth, and the sea, and the fountains of waters. ““And there followed another angel, saying, Babylon is fallen, is fallen, that great city, because she made all nations drink of the wine of the wrath of her fornication. ““And the third angel followed them, saying with a loud voice, If any man worship the beast and his image, and receive his mark in his forehead, or in his hand, the same shall drink of the wine of the wrath of God, which is poured out without mixture into the cup of his indignation; and he shall be tormented with fire and brimstone in the presence of the holy angels, and in the presence of the Lamb: and the smoke of their torment ascendeth up for ever and ever: and they have no rest day nor night, who worship the beast and his image, and whosoever receiveth the mark of his name. Here is the patience of the saints: here are they that keep the commandments of God, and the faith of Jesus.” —Revelation 14:6-12 As Satan works to deceive the world into compromising with error by casting aside God’s Sabbath in favor of a counterfeit day He never appointed, God will have a people who will proclaim a powerful, three-part message to the entire world—symbolized by the three angels of Revelation 14. This message will expose Satan’s deceptions so that every person will be informed about God’s true Sabbath and warned against receiving the mark of the beast—the counterfeit Sunday— because this decision carries eternal consequences. Those who choose to obey—and thus worship—the beast by honoring his man-made “holy” day will receive his mark, by which they cut themselves off from God’s mercy and exclude themselves from His eternal kingdom. But there will also be those who join God’s side, choosing to worship Him on His holy day. Through faith, Jesus’ sacrifice on the cross will cover their confessed and forsaken sins, and His grace will transform them into obedient followers, sealing them for eternity (Revelation 7:2-3). It may seem improbable that people’s eternal destiny will be determined by the day they choose to observe, but God often uses simple means to test our loyalty; affter all, Adam and Eve were expelled from the Garden for eating fruit from the wrong tree. Of course, the fruit was merely the means of settling a far greater issue—trust. Would Adam and Eve trust God or Satan? In the same way, the day of worship will represent the far greater issue of authority. Every person will have to decide: Whom will I acknowledge as the ultimate authority over my life—God or Satan? Who is the false prophet? “And I saw three unclean spirits like frogs come out of the mouth of the dragon, and out of the mouth of the beast, and out of the mouth of the false prophet.” —Revelation 16:13 “And the beast was taken, and with him the false prophet that wrought miracles before him, with which he deceived them that had received the mark of the beast, and them that worshipped his image. These both were cast alive into a lake of fire burning with brimstone.” —Revelation 19:20 The false prophet works miracles to deceive people into receiving the beast’s mark and worshiping his image. This miracle-working carries a spiritual connotation, as does the term false prophet. The lamb-like beast of Revelation 13:11-18 (representing the United States) also performs miracles (Revelation 13:13-14), and thus appears spiritual and trustworthy. In reality, however, it sets itself against God’s commandments by lending its power and influence to promote the Sunday-keeping movement on behalf of the papacy. The false prophet, therefore, represents the religious aspect—apostate Protestantism—of the lamb-like beast. It is called the false prophet because of Protestantism’s acceptance and propagation of the Preterist and Futurist interpretations of prophecy, both of which are false. The Protestant Reformers—such as John Wycliffe, John Huss, Martin Luther, William Tyndale, Nicholas Ridley, Thomas Cranmer, and John Knox—all held to the Historicist view, which identifies the Antichrist as the papacy; however, both Preterism and Futurism divert attention away from the papacy. Sadly, Protestantism has rejected the view of its founders and has thus become the false prophet. Incidentally, both interpretations were introduced by Roman Catholic Jesuits: Preterism by Luis de Alcázar and Futurism by Francisco Ribera. Preterism holds that the prophecies of Revelation were fulfilled in the past, prior to the rise of the papacy, while Futurism teaches that the Antichrist—understood as a future individual—will appear after the literal rebuilding of the Third Temple in Jerusalem. Futurism is especially popular in conservative religious circles in Washington, D.C., and appears to be influencing, at least in part, national policy regarding Israel. Is this the battle of Armageddon? “And the sixth angel poured out his vial upon the great river Euphrates; and the water thereof was dried up, that the way of the kings of the east might be prepared. And I saw three unclean spirits like frogs come out of the mouth of the dragon, and out of the mouth of the beast, and out of the mouth of the false prophet. For they are the spirits of devils, working miracles, which go forth unto the kings of the earth and of the whole world, to gather them to the battle of that great day of God Almighty. Behold, I come as a thief. Blessed is he that watcheth, and keepeth his garments, lest he walk naked, and they see his shame. And he gathered them together into a place called in the Hebrew tongue Armageddon.” —Revelation 16:12-16 “And I saw the beast, and the kings of the earth, and their armies, gathered together to make war against him that sat on the horse, and against his army.” —Revelation 19:19 “These have one mind, and shall give their power and strength unto the beast. These shall make war with the Lamb, and the Lamb shall overcome them: for he is Lord of lords, and King of kings: and they that are with him are called, and chosen, and faithful.” —Revelation 17:13-14 The battle of Armageddon is the final conflict between Christ and Satan. It is mentioned in the context of the beast and the false prophet, which indicates that it will be initiated by them and will involve all the nations of the world in a united effort against Jesus and His people, with the goal of destroying all who refuse to worship the beast. But God will intervene. The symbolic Euphrates River will dry up, meaning that popular support for the beast will disappear (Revelation 17:15), just prior to the coming of the “kings from the east,” a reference to the Second Coming of Christ (Ezekiel 43:2; Matthew 24:27), when the people of God will be delivered (Revelation 19:11-20). The battle will resume after the millennium, when Satan and his followers surround the New Jerusalem in an attempt to capture it, but before they do, they are destroyed by fire from heaven (Revelation 20:9), bringing the battle—and the great controversy between good and evil—to a final end. How can I be safe from deception? “To the law and to the testimony: if they speak not according to this word, it is because there is no light in them.” —Isaiah 8:20 “If any man will do his will, he shall know of the doctrine, whether it be of God, or whether I speak of myself.” —John 7:17 “I am the vine, ye are the branches: He that abideth in me, and I in him, the same bringeth forth much fruit: for without me ye can do nothing.” —John 15:5 Jesus will help me identify and avoid deception if I test every teaching by the Bible (Psalm 119:104), willingly follow the truth as He reveals it to me, and stay close to Him daily through prayer and the reading of His Word. While the battle may appear to be against Christ’s followers, ultimately it is against Him. The battle is His, and it has already been won on a hill called Calvary. The only question is: have I given Him my heart and joined His winning side? What does the Bible promise? “He that dwelleth in the secret place of the most High shall abide under the shadow of the Almighty. I will say of the LORD, He is my refuge and my fortress: my God; in him will I trust. Surely he shall deliver thee from the snare of the fowler, and from the noisome pestilence. He shall cover thee with his feathers, and under his wings shalt thou trust: his truth shall be thy shield and buckler. Thou shalt not be afraid for the terror by night; nor for the arrow that flieth by day; nor for the pestilence that walketh in darkness; nor for the destruction that wasteth at noonday. A thousand shall fall at thy side, and ten thousand at thy right hand; but it shall not come nigh thee. Only with thine eyes shalt thou behold and see the reward of the wicked. ““Because thou hast made the LORD, which is my refuge, even the most High, thy habitation; there shall no evil befall thee, neither shall any plague come nigh thy dwelling. For he shall give his angels charge over thee, to keep thee in all thy ways. They shall bear thee up in their hands, lest thou dash thy foot against a stone. Thou shalt tread upon the lion and adder: the young lion and the dragon shalt thou trample under feet. Because he hath set his love upon me, therefore will I deliver him: I will set him on high, because he hath known my name. He shall call upon me, and I will answer him: I will be with him in trouble; I will deliver him, and honour him. With long life will I satisfy him, and shew him my salvation.” —Psalm 91 God promises that His truth will be our shield against the arrows of deception, keeping us on the narrow path of righteousness that leads to His eternal kingdom.",
