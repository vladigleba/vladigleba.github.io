<p>Say unto them, As I live, saith the Lord GOD, <em>I have no pleasure in the death of the wicked</em>; but that the wicked turn from his way and live: <em>turn ye, turn ye from your evil ways; for why will ye die, O house of Israel</em>?</p>
</blockquote><figcaption>— Ezekiel 33:11</figcaption></figure><figure><blockquote>
<p>For the LORD shall rise up as in mount Perazim, he shall be wroth as in the valley of Gibeon, that he may do his work, <em>his strange work</em>; and bring to pass his act, <em>his strange act</em>.</p>
</blockquote><figcaption>— Isaiah 28:21</figcaption></figure><figure><blockquote>
<p>For, behold, <em>the day cometh, that shall burn as an oven; and all the proud, yea, and all that do wickedly, shall be stubble: and the day that cometh shall burn them up</em>, saith the LORD of hosts, that it shall leave them neither root nor branch. But unto you that fear my name shall the Sun of righteousness arise with healing in his wings; and ye shall go forth, and grow up as calves of the stall. And ye shall tread down the wicked; for they <em>shall be ashes</em> under the soles of your feet in the day that I shall do this, saith the LORD of hosts.</p>
</blockquote><figcaption>— Malachi 4:1-3</figcaption></figure><p>Because the wicked choose to cling to sin, which, at its core, is selfishness and in complete opposition to the government of love, God has no other choice but to destroy them. The Bible calls this a strange act because God has no pleasure in the death of the wicked; these are people for whom He died, but because they refuse to turn from their path of sin and destruction, He must respect their choice and leave them to its consequences so that the curse of sin—the misery, suffering, and ruin—can be finally blotted out. Note also that Malachi says the fire will burn them up and turn them into ashes, meaning they will not burn in hell forever.</p></section>

But they obeyed not, neither inclined their ear, but made their neck stiff, that they might not hear, nor receive instruction.</p>
<p>And it shall come to pass, if ye diligently hearken unto me, saith the LORD, to bring in no burden through the gates of this city on the sabbath day, but hallow the sabbath day, to do no work therein; then shall there enter into the gates of this city kings and princes sitting upon the throne of David, riding in chariots and on horses, they, and their princes, the men of Judah, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem: and this city shall remain for ever. And they shall come from the cities of Judah, and from the places about Jerusalem, and from the land of Benjamin, and from the plain, and from the mountains, and from the south, bringing burnt offerings, and sacrifices, and meat offerings, and incense, and bringing sacrifices of praise, unto the house of the LORD.</p>

This is referred to as “the end of the world” in other Bible passages because it is God’s final act of cleansing the world of sin. This also means there is no one burning in hell now. The Bible makes it clear that the dead are <a href="/basics/death/">in their graves</a> waiting for the resurrection: the saved are waiting for the first resurrection at the second coming of Christ, while the lost are waiting for the second resurrection at the end of the 1,000 years.</p></section>

</blockquote><figcaption>— Romans 6:23</figcaption></figure><figure><blockquote>
<p>Behold, they shall be as stubble; <em>the fire shall burn them</em>; they shall not deliver themselves from the power of the flame: <em>there shall not be a coal to warm at, nor fire to sit before it</em>.</p>
</blockquote><figcaption>— Isaiah 47:14</figcaption></figure><figure><blockquote>
<p>For the day of the LORD is near upon all the heathen: as thou hast done, it shall be done unto thee: thy reward shall return upon thine own head. For as ye have drunk upon my holy mountain, so shall all the heathen drink continually, yea, they shall drink, and they shall swallow down, and <em>they shall be as though they had not been</em>.</p>
</blockquote><figcaption>— Obadiah 1:15-16</figcaption></figure><p>Hell cannot burn forever because the wages of sin are death, not eternal torment for a short life of sin. How cruel would that be! This eternal hell teaching goes all the way back to the Garden of Eden where Satan told Eve she would surely not die (<a href="https://bible-api.com/Genesis%203%3A4?translation=kjv" class="verse-link" data-reference="Genesis 3:4" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Genesis 3:4</a>) even though God clearly said that sin brings death (<a href="https://bible-api.com/Genesis%202%3A17?translation=kjv" class="verse-link" data-reference="Genesis 2:17" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Genesis 2:17</a>). But make no mistake, Jesus would rather die on the cross Himself than watch His creation destroyed by fire; nevertheless, He also respects every person’s freedom of choice, and in an effort to purge the world from the misery of sin, it is, ultimately, an act of love to bring the rebellion to an end. And so the fire will burn out once it finishes its work, and there will be not a coal left to warm at. Satan, his angels, and the wicked will cease to exist, never to live again.</p></section>

<p>Looking for and hasting unto the coming of the day of God, wherein the heavens being on fire shall be dissolved, and the elements shall melt with fervent heat? Nevertheless we, according to his promise, look for <em>new heavens and a new earth, wherein dwelleth righteousness</em>.</p>
</blockquote><figcaption>— 2 Peter 3:12-13</figcaption></figure><figure><blockquote>
<p>And <em>I saw a new heaven and a new earth: for the first heaven and the first earth were passed away</em>; and there was no more sea. And I John saw the holy city, new Jerusalem, coming down from God out of heaven, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband. And I heard a great voice out of heaven saying, Behold, the tabernacle of God is with men, and he will dwell with them, and they shall be his people, and God himself shall be with them, and be their God. And <em>God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes; and there shall be no more death, neither sorrow, nor crying, neither shall there be any more pain: for the former things are passed away</em>.</p>
</blockquote><figcaption>— Revelation 21:1-4</figcaption></figure><figure><blockquote>
<p>What do ye imagine against the LORD? he will make an utter end: <em>affliction shall not rise up the second time</em>.</p>
</blockquote><figcaption>— Nahum 1:9</figcaption></figure><p>Once every trace of sin is wiped out, God will create a new heaven and a new earth in which righteousness dwells. The universe will be forever secure from the curse of sin ever rising again because everyone will know, from experience, that God is love. The rebellion brought out the love of Jesus and the Father like nothing else could, and it was their love that conquered it.</p></section>
