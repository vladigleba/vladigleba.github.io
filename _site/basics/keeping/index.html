</blockquote><figcaption>— Deuteronomy 28:1-2, 15</figcaption></figure><p>The Sabbath was not made to be a burden, but a blessing to the human race. Those who keep it partake of that blessing on a weekly basis. In Deuteronomy 28, God pronounces additional blessings on those who keep His commandments, including the fourth.</p></section>

It is a special weekly blessing for everyone who chooses to rest from their works by trusting in Him. We may have a long list of things to do, but we can still set them aside in order to have time to connect with God and acknowledge His supremacy in our lives. This rest from work extends to everyone “within our gates,” meaning those under our authority.</p></section>

<p>And they went into Capernaum; and straightway <em>on the sabbath day he entered into the synagogue, and taught</em>.</p>

<p>And it came to pass also <em>on another sabbath, that he entered into the synagogue and taught</em>: and there was a man whose right hand was withered.</p>
</blockquote><figcaption>— Luke 6:6</figcaption></figure><p>Looking to Jesus as our example in all things, we learn that Sabbath keeping also involves gathering with other believers for worship, spiritual nourishment, and fellowship. The verses above also show that teaching was a vital part of the synagogue experience, meaning it was far more than a casual weekly social gathering. It was a place for studying Scripture, where worshippers could learn, share, and become grounded in the truth (<a href="https://bible-api.com/2%20Timothy%202%3A15?translation=kjv" class="verse-link" data-reference="2 Timothy 2:15" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2 Timothy 2:15</a>).</p></section>

<p>And God called the light Day, and the darkness he called Night. And <em>the evening and the morning were the first day</em>.</p>
</blockquote><figcaption>— Genesis 1:5</figcaption></figure><p>In the Bible, a day does not begin and end at midnight; it starts at sunset and continues until the following sunset. In the Genesis account, each day includes the prior evening as well, so since the Sabbath is the seventh day of the week, it begins at sunset on Friday and ends at sunset on Saturday.</p></section>

</blockquote><figcaption>— Isaiah 58:13-14</figcaption></figure><p>The Sabbath becomes a delight when Jesus is at its center—when we put away our own pursuits and rest from the cares of life to focus on the eternal things of God. It’s a special day to reflect on, honor, and connect with Him. Simply put, it is a day to delight in Him.</p><p>The motivation behind Sabbath-keeping is crucial because it determines whether the day becomes a delight or a burden. Only when we keep it out of love for Christ—rather than duty—are we enabled to deny self and still call the Sabbath a delight. The truly born-again follower of Christ transitions from an attitude of “Don’t tell me what to do” to “What would You have me do?”</p></section>

<p>In those days <em>saw I in Judah some treading wine presses on the sabbath, and bringing in sheaves, and lading asses; as also wine, grapes, and figs, and all manner of burdens, which they brought into Jerusalem on the sabbath day</em>: and I testified against them in the day wherein they sold victuals. There dwelt men of Tyre also therein, which brought fish, and all manner of ware, and <em>sold on the sabbath</em> unto the children of Judah, and in Jerusalem. Then I contended with the nobles of Judah, and said unto them, What evil thing is this that ye do, and profane the sabbath day? Did not your fathers thus, and did not our God bring all this evil upon us, and upon this city? yet ye bring more wrath upon Israel by profaning the sabbath.</p>
<p>And it came to pass, that when the gates of Jerusalem began to be dark before the sabbath, I commanded that the gates should be shut, and charged that they should not be opened till after the sabbath: and some of my servants set I at the gates, that there should no burden be brought in on the sabbath day. So the merchants and sellers of all kind of ware lodged without Jerusalem once or twice. Then I testified against them, and said unto them, Why lodge ye about the wall? if ye do so again, I will lay hands on you. <em>From that time forth came they no more on the sabbath. And I commanded the Levites that they should cleanse themselves, and that they should come and keep the gates, to sanctify the sabbath day</em>.</p>
</blockquote><figcaption>— Nehemiah 13:15-22</figcaption></figure><p>We can clearly see that buying, selling, and conducting business to generate income are activities that profane the Sabbath day. This can pose a challenge for some professions; for example, it would not be right to abandon those in need of medical care on the Sabbath for example. However, as far as possible, we should seek to rest from secular activities in order to honor our Creator.</p></section>

How much then is a man better than a sheep? Wherefore <em>it is lawful to do well on the sabbath days</em>. Then saith he to the man, Stretch forth thine hand. And he stretched it forth; and it was restored whole, like as the other.</p>
</blockquote><figcaption>— Matthew 12:11-13</figcaption></figure><p>Jesus continued to heal on the Sabbath, contrary to the traditions of the religious leaders of His time. Ministry to the sick, the needy, and the discouraged—by relieving their physical, emotional, or spiritual suffering—extends the blessing and delight of the Sabbath beyond ourselves to others.</p></section>

His redemptive power is available to all who turn to His Word, the Bible, and claim His promises by faith (<a href="https://bible-api.com/Ezekiel%2036%3A25-27?translation=kjv" class="verse-link" data-reference="Ezekiel 36:25-27" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ezekiel 36:25-27</a>; <a href="https://bible-api.com/Jeremiah%2031%3A33?translation=kjv" class="verse-link" data-reference="Jeremiah 31:33" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Jeremiah 31:33</a>; <a href="https://bible-api.com/2%20Corinthians%205%3A17?translation=kjv" class="verse-link" data-reference="2 Corinthians 5:17" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2 Corinthians 5:17</a>; <a href="https://bible-api.com/Galatians%203%3A22?translation=kjv" class="verse-link" data-reference="Galatians 3:22" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Galatians 3:22</a>).</p><p>One more thing worth mentioning: <a href="https://bible-api.com/Acts%2016%3A13?translation=kjv" class="verse-link" data-reference="Acts 16:13" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Acts 16:13</a> shows us that prayer can be the perfect complement to time spent in nature. As we contemplate God’s creation, we may find ourselves naturally drawn into prayer—thanking and praising Him for what He has done, or simply sharing what is on our hearts.</p></section>

<p>And it came to pass, that he went through the corn fields on the sabbath day; and his disciples began, as they went, to pluck the ears of corn. And the Pharisees said unto him, Behold, why do they on the sabbath day that which is not lawful? And he said unto them, Have ye never read what David did, when he had need, and was an hungred, he, and they that were with him? How he went into the house of God in the days of Abiathar the high priest, and did eat the shewbread, which is not lawful to eat but for the priests, and gave also to them which were with him? And he said unto them, <em>The sabbath was made for man, and not man for the sabbath</em>: therefore the Son of man is Lord also of the sabbath.</p>
</blockquote><figcaption>— Mark 2:23-28</figcaption></figure><p>The Pharisees added so many man-made rules in an effort to protect the Sabbath’s holiness that they turned it into a burden. But Jesus did not follow their rules—He followed His Father’s will regarding proper Sabbath-keeping. In fact, Jesus clarified that the Sabbath was made for us, not the other way around (For a more in-depth look at how to keep the Sabbath holy, see Doug Batchelor’s book <a href="https://www.amazingfacts.org/media-library/book/e/26000/t/how-to-keep-the-sabbath-holy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>How to Keep the Sabbath Holy</em></a>.)</p></section>

<p>For I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ: for it is the power of God unto salvation <em>to every one that believeth</em>; to the Jew first, and also to the Greek. For therein is the righteousness of God revealed from faith to faith: as it is written, <em>The just shall live by faith</em>.</p>

<p>I am crucified with Christ: nevertheless I live; <em>yet not I, but Christ liveth in me</em>: and the life which I now live in the flesh I live <em>by the faith of the Son of God</em>, who loved me, and gave himself for me.</p>
</blockquote><figcaption>— Galatians 2:20</figcaption></figure><p>The only way the Sabbath can be kept holy is in Christ and <a href="/gospel/faith/">by faith</a>. Without Christ living in us by faith, through His Spirit (<a href="https://bible-api.com/John%2014%3A17?translation=kjv" class="verse-link" data-reference="John 14:17" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">John 14:17</a>; <a href="https://bible-api.com/Ephesians%202%3A22?translation=kjv" class="verse-link" data-reference="Ephesians 2:22" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ephesians 2:22</a>), we are completely incapable of keeping it holy. According to Paul, it is not even our own faith that enables this, but Christ’s faith working in us! No wonder Revelation speaks of a group of God’s faithful people who “keep the commandments of God and the faith of Jesus” (<a href="https://bible-api.com/Revelation%2014%3A12?translation=kjv" class="verse-link" data-reference="Revelation 14:12" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Revelation 14:12</a>). Trying to keep His commandments in any way other than by faith is like asking a plant to grow without sunlight—an impossibility.</p><p>In <a href="https://bible-api.com/Jeremiah%2031%3A33?translation=kjv" class="verse-link" data-reference="Jeremiah 31:33" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Jeremiah 31:33</a>, God promised to write His law in our hearts. Do we believe Him? If He said it, He will fulfill it; we just have to ask! Have we asked Him, claimed His promise by faith, and thanked Him for doing it—even <em>before</em> we see any results? This is faith: taking God at His Word because He cannot lie (<a href="https://bible-api.com/Numbers%2023%3A19?translation=kjv" class="verse-link" data-reference="Numbers 23:19" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Numbers 23:19</a>). Of course, we always have the freedom to interfere with or disrupt this process by filling our minds with things that glamorize sin. But if we choose to cooperate with Him, He will complete the work He began in us (<a href="https://bible-api.com/Hebrews%2012%3A2?translation=kjv" class="verse-link" data-reference="Hebrews 12:2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hebrews 12:2</a>; <a href="https://bible-api.com/Jude%201%3A24-25?translation=kjv" class="verse-link" data-reference="Jude 1:24-25" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Jude 1:24-25</a>), and we will be able to genuinely say, “I delight to do thy will, O my God: yea, thy law is within my heart” (<a href="https://bible-api.com/Psalm%2040%3A8?translation=kjv" class="verse-link" data-reference="Psalm 40:8" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Psalm 40:8</a>).</p></section>

So the people rested on the seventh day.</p>

<p>Wherefore the LORD God of Israel saith, I said indeed that thy house, and the house of thy father, should walk before me for ever: but now the LORD saith, Be it far from me; <em>for them that honour me I will honour</em>, and they that despise me shall be lightly esteemed.</p>
</blockquote><figcaption>— 1 Samuel 2:30</figcaption></figure><p>It may be tempting to worry about lost income on the Sabbath, but just as God miraculously provided a double portion of manna for the Israelites on Friday so they would have enough for Saturday, He will also provide for our needs today when we choose to honor Him by resting on His holy day.</p></section>
