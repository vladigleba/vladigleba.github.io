<p>Jesus uses the state of sleep as a metaphor for death because He knows there will be a resurrection at the second coming. This will be a resurrection of those who died in Christ because He was the only One who conquered death.</p>

<p>John makes it clear there will be two resurrections for two different groups of people: those who, through the grace of Christ, reflected goodness in their life will be part of the resurrection of life, which takes place at the second coming of Jesus, while those who lived unrighteous lives will be part of the resurrection of damnation.</p>

<p>God made man by forming him from the dust of the ground and breathing into him the breath of life. In other words, dust (the body) plus breath of God equals a living soul.</p>

<figure><blockquote>
<p>For as <em>the body without the spirit is dead</em>, so faith without works is dead also.</p>
</blockquote><figcaption>— James 2:26</figcaption></figure>

<p>The spirit that returns to God is simply the breath of life, without which the body dies. In other words, the process described in <a href="https://bible-api.com/Ecclesiastes%2012%3A7?translation=kjv" class="verse-link" data-reference="Ecclesiastes 12:7" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ecclesiastes 12:7</a> is the opposite of what happened in <a href="https://bible-api.com/Genesis%202%3A7?translation=kjv" class="verse-link" data-reference="Genesis 2:7" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Genesis 2:7</a>. If a soul is a combination of two things—the body and the breath of life (spirit)—then the soul ceases to exist when the body returns to dust and the breath returns to God. The soul does not go anywhere; it simply ceases to exist. As an illustration, consider what is needed for light: there needs to be an electrical current and a bulb. As soon as the electrical current is turned off, the light simply ceases to exist. It is the same with the soul.</p>

</blockquote><figcaption>— Romans 3:23</figcaption></figure>

<p>A person’s soul or spirit cannot go to heaven or hell after death because the Bible is clear that the soul that sins shall die. Why is this the case? Because the wages of sin are death, and all have sinned.</p>

<p>Since the spirit is simply the breath then it is not possible for the spirit to exist after death.

<p>Man is fully mortal; only God is immortal.

So when this corruptible shall have put on incorruption, and this mortal shall have put on immortality, then shall be brought to pass the saying that is written, <em>Death is swallowed up in victory</em>.</p>
</blockquote><figcaption>— 1 Corinthians 15:51-54</figcaption></figure>

<p>1 Corinthians 15 says that not all the righteous will experience death, but all the righteous will be changed when the trumpet of God sounds at the second coming. In other words, the righteous who are live to see the second coming, as well as those who died in Christ, who will at that moment be resurrected, will receive new, immortal bodies. From that point on death will never have power over them because Jesus defeated it, and by accepting His sacrifice on their behalf, they will inherit His victory over it!</p>

<p>Jesus could not have gone to heaven after His death because on Sunday morning He told Mary He hadn’t yet ascended to His Father. It’s a little know fact, but the original Bible text did not have any punctuation. It was added centuries later by translators who could have placed the comma before the word “today” due to their own beliefs about death. The better place for the comma would be after the word “today” because then it would be in harmony with all the other Bible texts regarding death. Jesus was promising the thief on the cross that day—when it did not look like He could save anyone—that he would be with Him in Paradise one day when He returns to take all of His children home to heaven.</p>

<p>It could not have been Samuel that Saul saw because the Bible is clear that the dead remain dead until the resurrection. In Revelation we learn that the devil has fallen angels whom he was able to persuade to join his rebellion in heaven, and after he was cast to earth, they were cast down with him (<a href="https://bible-api.com/Revelation%2012%3A4?translation=kjv" class="verse-link" data-reference="Revelation 12:4" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Revelation 12:4</a>). In other places, they are called “lying spirits” and “spirits of devils” who have the power to work miracles, including masquerading as human beings.

</blockquote><figcaption>— Isaiah 8:19-20, NKJV</figcaption></figure>

<p>Communication with spirits is forbidden in the Bible because it’s an abomination to God. Paul also warns that this practice is one of the signs of the last days, and it will lead to deception and a departure from the faith, meaning it will be practiced by those who claim to be believers. Isaiah says that the only way to identify whether a spirit is from God or not is to compare what it says with the Word of God because every lying spirit will speak contrary to His Word.</p>

<p><em>I have fought a good fight, I have finished my course, I have kept the faith</em>: henceforth there is laid up for me a crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous judge, shall give me at that day: and not to me only, but unto all them also that love his appearing.</p>

<p>May the grace of Jesus help us to live a life of unwavering commitment and faithfulness to Him.</p>
