<p>Remember the sabbath day, to keep it holy. Six days shalt thou labour, and do all thy work: but the seventh day is the sabbath of the LORD thy God: in it thou shalt not do any work, thou, nor thy son, nor thy daughter, thy manservant, nor thy maidservant, nor thy cattle, nor thy stranger that is within thy gates: <em>for in six days the LORD made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that in them is, and rested the seventh day</em>: wherefore the LORD blessed the sabbath day, and hallowed it.</p>
</blockquote><figcaption>— Exodus 20:8-11</figcaption></figure><p data-search-id="paragraph-3">The fourth commandment begins with the word “remember” because God knew His Sabbath would be forgotten. It then identifies Him as the Creator of all things, thus providing the reason He has a claim to our worship, which all who rest on the Sabbath day acknowledge. The Sabbath commandment also contains the three basic elements of a seal: name (“the Lord”), title (“your God”), and territory (“heaven and earth”). This uniquely identifies God as the author of the other nine commandments and establishes His authority. In other words, the authority of the Decalogue rests on the fourth commandment; without it, anyone could claim authorship of the other nine.</p></section>

<p>Thus the heavens and the earth were finished, and all the host of them.

And <em>God blessed the seventh day, and sanctified it</em>: because that in it he had rested from all his work which God created and made.</p>
</blockquote><figcaption>— Genesis 2:1-3</figcaption></figure><p data-search-id="paragraph-4">The reason why the fourth commandment invites me to keep the Sabbath day holy is because God blessed this specific day and sanctified it. The word used in the original text is <em>qadash</em>, which means “to be set apart or consecrated.” In other words, the seventh day, is special to God and unlike any of the other six days of the week.</p></section>

<p>For thus saith the LORD unto the eunuchs that keep my sabbaths, and choose the things that please me, and take hold of my covenant; rven unto them will I give in mine house and within my walls a place and a name better than of sons and of daughters: I will give them an everlasting name, that shall not be cut off. Also <em>the sons of the stranger, that join themselves to the LORD</em>, to serve him, and to love the name of the LORD, to be his servants, <em>every one that keepeth the sabbath from polluting it</em>, and taketh hold of my covenant; even them will I bring to my holy mountain, and make them joyful in my house of prayer: their burnt offerings and their sacrifices shall be accepted upon mine altar; for mine house shall be called an house of prayer for all people.</p>
</blockquote><figcaption>— Isaiah 56:4-7</figcaption></figure><p data-search-id="paragraph-5">The Sabbath was made for all humanity. When God established the Sabbath, He did not need the rest it provided, for He does not grow weary (<a href="https://bible-api.com/Isaiah%2040%3A28?translation=kjv" class="verse-link" data-reference="Isaiah 40:28" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Isaiah 40:28</a>). Nor had He labored in the way we do, since apart from forming Adam and Eve, His creative acts were accomplished simply by speaking. But humanity <em>does</em> grow weary from labor and therefore needs the rest the Sabbath provides.</p><p data-search-id="paragraph-6">This is affirmed in the Old Testament, for Isaiah declares that the Sabbath was not only for the Israelites but also for the “strangers”—outsiders—who chose to “join themselves to the Lord.” Jesus, the Creator and Lord of the Sabbath, confirmed this same truth in the New Testament when He declared, “The Sabbath was made for man.” He could have said “for the Jews,” but He did not. Therefore, the commonly used expression “Jewish Sabbath” reflects either genuine ignorance or a serious misunderstanding of Scripture.</p></section>

</blockquote><figcaption>— Deuteronomy 5:15</figcaption></figure><p data-search-id="paragraph-7">The Sabbath is a sign of my acknowledgment that:</p><ol>
<li data-search-id="list-0-item-0">
<p>God is Lord because He created this world in six consecutive, literal, 24-hour days (<a href="https://bible-api.com/Exodus%2020%3A8%2C%2011?translation=kjv" class="verse-link" data-reference="Exodus 20:8, 11" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Exodus 20:8, 11</a>). The Sabbath is a weekly reminder that I have a Creator who desires to have a relationship with me. This truth carries several important implications: I am not self-created; I am not a god, nor can I become one; I possess no inherent divinity—no inner godhood or divine spark; I do not have an immortal soul, for only God is immortal (<a href="https://bible-api.com/1%20Timothy%206%3A15-16?translation=kjv" class="verse-link" data-reference="1 Timothy 6:15-16" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">1 Timothy 6:15-16</a>); and I did not come into existence by accident or through a long process of evolution. My life has meaning and purpose.</p>
</li>
<li data-search-id="list-0-item-1">
<p>God is Lord of my life because He is the One who redeems and sanctifies me. In the Bible, the Israelites’ bondage in Egypt symbolizes the spiritual bondage of sin from which God delivers me. Therefore, the Sabbath is a weekly reminder that, in Jesus, victory over sin is available to all. After all, Jesus would not have told the woman caught in adultery to “go and sin no more” if that were impossible (<a href="https://bible-api.com/John%208%3A11?translation=kjv" class="verse-link" data-reference="John 8:11" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">John 8:11</a>). Moreover, the Sabbath is a sign that I am not saved by my own works, but by faith in His completed work on the cross, as well as His ongoing work as my Intercessor in the <a href="/gospel/sanctuary/#do-i-have-a-high-priest-today">heavenly sanctuary</a>.</p>
</li>
</ol><p data-search-id="paragraph-8">In Eden, God rested on the seventh day from His work of creation, and in the tomb, Jesus rested on the same day from His work of redemption. Therefore, the Sabbath serves as a memorial of both acts. It is a weekly rest in Jesus, during which I set aside my secular work and worldly duties to connect with and honor Him—no matter how busy life may become.</p></section>
