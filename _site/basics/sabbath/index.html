</blockquote><figcaption>— Revelation 14:6-7</figcaption></figure><p>In Revelation 14 there are three angels proclaiming a message to the people of the world in the last days, and the first angel’s message is a call to worship the Creator God and give glory to Him.</p></section>

<p>Remember the sabbath day, to keep it holy. Six days shalt thou labour, and do all thy work: but the seventh day is the sabbath of the LORD thy God: in it thou shalt not do any work, thou, nor thy son, nor thy daughter, thy manservant, nor thy maidservant, nor thy cattle, nor thy stranger that is within thy gates: <em>for in six days the LORD made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that in them is, and rested the seventh day</em>: wherefore the LORD blessed the sabbath day, and hallowed it.</p>
</blockquote><figcaption>— Exodus 20:8-11</figcaption></figure><p>The fourth commandment begins with “remember” because God knew His Sabbath would be forgotten. It then identifies Him as the Creator of all things, thus laying the foundation for the invitation to all people to acknowledge Him as Creator by resting on the Sabbath day, just as He rested on the seventh day as an example for us.</p><p>Moreover, the fourth commandment contains the three basic elements of a seal: name (“the Lord”), title (“your God”), and territory (“heaven and earth).” This uniquely identifies God as the author of the other nine commandments and provides the reason for His authority. In other words, the authority of all Ten Commandments rests on the fourth. Without it, any being could claim authorship of the other nine, and thus the Decalogue would lose its divine authority and rightful claim over our lives.</p></section>

<p>Thus the heavens and the earth were finished, and all the host of them. And on the seventh day God ended his work which he had made; and he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had made. And <em>God blessed the seventh day, and sanctified it</em>: because that in it he had rested from all his work which God created and made.</p>
</blockquote><figcaption>— Genesis 2:1-3</figcaption></figure><p>The reason why the fourth commandment invites me to keep the Sabbath day holy is because God blessed this specific day and sanctified it. The word used in the original text is <em>qadash</em>, which means “to be set apart or consecrated.” In other words, the seventh day, is special to God and unlike any of the other six days of the week.</p></section>

</blockquote><figcaption>— Ezekiel 20:12, 20</figcaption></figure><figure><blockquote>
<p>And remember that thou wast a servant in the land of Egypt, and <em>that the LORD thy God brought thee out thence through a mighty hand and by a stretched out arm</em>: therefore the LORD thy God commanded thee to keep the sabbath day.</p>
</blockquote><figcaption>— Deuteronomy 5:15</figcaption></figure><p>The Sabbath is a sign of my acknowledgment that:</p><ol>
<li>God is Lord because He created this world in six consecutive, literal, 24-hour days (<a href="https://bible-api.com/Exodus%2020%3A8%2C%2011?translation=kjv" class="verse-link" data-reference="Exodus 20:8, 11" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Exodus 20:8, 11</a>). The Sabbath is a weekly reminder that I have a Creator who desires to have a relationship with me. This truth carries several important implications: I am not self-created; I am not a god, nor can I become one; I possess no inherent divinity—no inner godhood or divine spark; I do not have an immortal soul, for only God is immortal (<a href="https://bible-api.com/1%20Timothy%206%3A15-16?translation=kjv" class="verse-link" data-reference="1 Timothy 6:15-16" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">1 Timothy 6:15-16</a>); and I did not come into existence by accident or through a long process of evolution. My life has meaning and purpose.</li>
<li>God is Lord of my life because He is the One who redeems and sanctifies me. In the Bible, the Israelites’ bondage in Egypt symbolizes the spiritual bondage of sin from which God delivers me. Therefore, the Sabbath is a weekly reminder that, in Jesus, victory over sin is available to all. After all, Jesus would not have told the woman caught in adultery to “go and sin no more” if that were impossible (<a href="https://bible-api.com/John%208%3A11?translation=kjv" class="verse-link" data-reference="John 8:11" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">John 8:11</a>). Moreover, the Sabbath is a sign that I am not saved by my own works, but by faith in His completed work on the cross, as well as His ongoing work as my Intercessor in the <a href="/gospel/sanctuary/#do-i-have-a-high-priest-today">heavenly sanctuary</a>.</li>
</ol><p>In Eden, God rested on the seventh day from His work of creation, and in the tomb, Jesus rested on the same day from His work of redemption. Therefore, the Sabbath serves as a memorial of both acts. It is a weekly rest in Jesus, during which I set aside my secular work and worldly duties to connect with and honor Him—no matter how busy life may become.</p></section>

<p>Speak thou also unto the children of Israel, saying, Verily <em>my sabbaths</em> ye shall keep: for it is a sign between me and you throughout your generations; that ye may know that I am the LORD that doth sanctify you.</p>

Notice that He calls these days “My Sabbaths,” meaning it is His special day, which He blessed and sanctified to be a sign between Him and His people of His creative, redeeming, and sanctifying power.</p></section>

The Decalogue is a <a href="/gospel/law/#what-is-gods-law-a-reflection-of">transcript of His character</a> and, as such, it can never be altered, which is good news, because it means His righteous and loving character will never change! Although some have claimed that His commandments have been altered—and the <a href="/prophecy/change/">Bible predicted</a> such attempts—the truth remains that His commandments are unchangeable.</p></section>

In heaven, it will also take on a new dimension as a memorial of His power to redeem the world itself from the curse of sin after He recreates it anew!</p></section>
