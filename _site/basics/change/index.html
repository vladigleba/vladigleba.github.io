And <em>this is the word which by the gospel is preached unto you</em>.</p>
</blockquote><figcaption>— 1 Peter 1:22-25</figcaption></figure><p>Truth is personified in Jesus and revealed in His Word, <a href="/basics/bible/">the Bible</a>. Apart from the small number who were able to see and hear it embodied in Jesus, truth is preserved for the rest of us in the Old and New Testaments. It may seem unfair, but we must remember that the majority rejected Him, not realizing that He was indeed the Messiah, the Son of God. Let us also remember the words of Jesus Himself to the unbelieving Thomas: “Because thou hast seen me, thou hast believed; blessed are they that have not seen, and yet have believed” (<a href="https://bible-api.com/John%2020%3A29?translation=kjv" class="verse-link" data-reference="John 20:29" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">John 20:29</a>).</p></section>

Wherefore do ye spend money for that which is not bread? and your labour for that which satisfieth not? hearken diligently unto me, and eat ye that which is good, and let your soul delight itself in fatness. Incline your ear, and come unto me: hear, and your soul shall live; and I will make an everlasting covenant with you, even the sure mercies of David.</p>

<p>Again, the kingdom of heaven is like unto a merchant man, seeking goodly pearls: who, <em>when he had found one pearl of great price, went and sold all that he had, and bought it</em>.</p>
</blockquote><figcaption>— Matthew 13:45</figcaption></figure><p>Truth is a free gift that can be obtained “without money and without price” by the poorest and the richest; yet, because we live in a world where good and evil are at war, error and deception strive for supremacy over truth. Due to Satan’s incessant warfare against it, truth often brings reproach, inconvenience, and sacrifice into the lives of those who, having found it in God’s Word, consider it better than gold and sweeter than honey. Some are willing to sacrifice everything for it, while personal gain, convenience, or persecution causes others to abandon it.</p></section>

</blockquote><figcaption>— Malachi 3:6</figcaption></figure><p>Since Jesus cannot change, His law cannot change either, for it <a href="/gospel/law/#what-is-gods-law-a-reflection-of">reflects His holy and unchanging character</a>. Consequently, God could not alter His holy law and still remain the infinitely holy God that He is. Moreover, if His law could have been modified, the Father would have never needed to send His Son to die for our sins on Calvary. Christ’s death stands as eternal testimony that the law is as immutable as God Himself.</p><p>It is often claimed that because of Jesus’ death, we are no longer under the law but under grace. But which of the Ten Commandments do we no longer need? Since Jesus died for our sins, are we now free to have other gods, bow down to images, blaspheme God’s name, desecrate His Sabbath, dishonor our parents, murder, commit adultery, steal, lie, and covet? <a href="/gospel/law/#does-that-mean-we-are-now-free-to-break-it">Of course not.</a> Each of these commandments remains as relevant today as when they were first proclaimed on Mount Sinai.</p></section>

Since the Roman religion of Mithraism was borrowed from Greece through the Kingdom of Pergamon, it is not contradictory to say that this power emerged from both the Greek and Roman Empires.</p><p>In fact, Mithraism was the Persian name for Babylonian sun worship, for Mithra was the Persian god of light, who, under the Roman Empire, was identified with the sun god <em>Sol Invictus</em>, the invincible or unconquerable sun. This sun worship was later Christianized when Catholicism declared Sunday holy in honor of Christ’s resurrection—a day long associated with pagan sun worship, not only in Mithraism but also in the religion of ancient Babylon.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">[1]</a></sup> Thus, there is a direct line of continuity between the religions of Babylon, Persia, Greece, Rome, and Catholicism—a progression symbolically illustrated in the <a href="/prophecy/europe/">image of Daniel 2</a>.</p><p>There is only one commandment that is both a law and a measure of time: the fourth.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn2" id="fnref2">[2]</a></sup> The first seeds of its alteration were planted when Constantine converted to Christianity in 312 AD, for after becoming Emperor, he granted Christian bishops influence in the legislative process. Under their guidance, he soon passed the first Sunday law in 321 AD, declaring Sunday—the pagan day of sun worship—the official day of rest across the Roman Empire. This was reinforced in 364 AD, when the Council of Laodicea urged Christians to observe Sunday as their rest day while prohibiting them from resting on Saturday. Thus, the fourth commandment of God was effectively changed—from honoring the biblical seventh-day Sabbath established at creation to observing Sunday—and the rest is history.</p></section>

Why? Because it is idolatry. Idolatry is traditionally defined as the worship of idols—human-made images. In the same way, Sunday sacredness is a human-made tradition. Just as God did not create the sun as an object of worship, He did not establish the first day as a day of worship; therefore, there is no real difference between worshiping the object and venerating the day.</p></section>

<p>Now in the matter of Sabbath observance the Protestant rule of Faith is utterly unable to explain the substitution of the Christian Sunday for the Jewish Saturday. It has been changed. The Bible still teaches that the Sabbath or Saturday should be kept holy. There is no authority in the New Testament for the substitution of Sunday for Saturday. Surely it is an important matter. It stands there in the Bible as one of the Ten Commandments of God. <em>There is no authority in the Bible for abrogating this Commandment, or for transferring its observance to another day of the week.</em> …</p>
<p>We have in the authoritative voice of the Church the voice of Christ Himself. <em>The Church is above the Bible; and this transference of Sabbath observance from Saturday to Sunday is proof positive of that fact.

<p>My brethren, look about you upon the various wrangling sects and denominations. Show me one that claims, or possesses the power to make laws binding on the conscience. <em>There’s but one on the face of the earth—the Catholic Church—that has the power to make laws binding upon the conscience, binding before God, binding under pain of hell fire.</em> Take for instance the day we celebrate—Sunday. What right have the Protestant churches to observe that, day? None whatever. … Sunday is not the Sabbath according to the Bible and the record of time. Every one knows that Sunday is the first day of the week, while Saturday is the seventh day and the Sabbath, the day consecrated as a day of rest. It is so recognized in all civilized nations.</p>
<p>I have repeatedly offered $1000 to any one who will furnish any proof from the Bible that Sunday is the day we are bound to keep, and no one has called for the money. If any person in this town will show me any scripture for it I will, tomorrow evening, publicly acknowledge it and thank him for it. <em>It was the holy Catholic Church that changed the day of rest from Saturday to Sunday, the first day of the week.</em> And it not only compelled all to keep Sunday, but at the Council of Laodicea, A. D. 364, anathematized those who kept the Sabbath and urged all persons to labor on the seventh day under the penalty of anathema.</p>
<p>Which church does the whole civilized world obey? Protestants … profess great reverence for the Bible, and yet <em>by their solemn act of keeping Sunday they acknowledge the power of the Catholic Church. The Bible says, ‘Remember the Sabbath day, to keep it holy,’ but the Catholic Church says, ‘No, keep the first day of the week,’ and the whole world bows in obedience.</em></p>

<p>Protestants have repeatedly asked the papacy, “How could you dare to change God’s law?” But the question posed to Protestants by the Catholic church is even more penetrating.</p>
<p>Here it is officially: You will tell me that Saturday was the Jewish Sabbath, but that the Christian Sabbath has been changed to Sunday. Changed! but by whom? <em>Who has authority to change an express commandment of Almighty God? When God has spoken and said, Thou shalt keep holy the seventh day, who shall dare to say, Nay, thou mayest work and do all manner of worldly business on the seventh day; but thou shalt keep holy the first day in its stead?</em></p>
<p>This is a most important question, which I know not how you can answer. You are a Protestant, and you profess to go by the Bible and the Bible only; and <em>yet in so important a matter as the observance of one day in seven as a holy day, you go against the plain letter of the Bible, and put another day in the place of that day which the Bible has commanded.</em></p>
<p>The command to keep holy the seventh day is one of the ten commandments; <em>you believe that the other nine are still binding; who gave you authority to tamper with the fourth?</em> If you are consistent with your own principles, if you really follow the Bible and the Bible only, you ought to be able to produce some portion of the New Testament in which this fourth commandment is expressly altered.</p>

The historicist method, championed by the Protestant Reformers, has largely been abandoned in favor of the preterist and futurist methods, introduced by the Roman Catholic Jesuits Luis de Alcazar and Francisco Ribera. Alcazar proposed that the prophecies of Daniel and Revelation were fulfilled in the past (preterism), while Ribera suggested they will be fulfilled in the future (futurism). Historicism, on the other hand, views prophecy as relevant throughout church history, tracing it to specific historical events, nations, and movements. The preterist and futurist methods were introduced mainly to counter the historicist method and to divert attention away from Catholicism as a major power in end-time prophetic scenarios, since historicism unequivocally identifies the Roman Catholic Church <a href="/prophecy/mark/">as the sea beast</a> of Revelation 13. <a href="#fnref2" class="footnote-backref">↩︎</a></p>
