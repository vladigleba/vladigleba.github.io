</blockquote><figcaption>— Isaiah 66:22-23</figcaption></figure><p data-search-id="paragraph-1">The seventh-day Sabbath was set apart, blessed, and sanctified in the very first week of creation, long before there was a Jewish nation, and it will be kept even in heaven as a testament to God as our Creator and Redeemer.

</blockquote><figcaption>— Ezekiel 20:12</figcaption></figure><p data-search-id="paragraph-2">Because all have sinned, all need the sanctifying power of Christ—of which the Sabbath is a sign; therefore, it cannot be a sign for the Jewish nation only, for sin is no respecter of persons, just as God’s power to sanctify is no respecter of sinners. As God set the Sabbath apart as a day for Himself, so He sets us apart as a people for Himself (<a href="https://bible-api.com/1%20Peter%202%3A9?translation=kjv" class="verse-link" data-reference="1 Peter 2:9" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">1 Peter 2:9</a>; <a href="https://bible-api.com/2%20Corinthians%206%3A17-18?translation=kjv" class="verse-link" data-reference="2 Corinthians 6:17-18" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2 Corinthians 6:17-18</a>).</p></section>

Let us labour therefore to enter into that rest</em>, lest any man fall after the same example of unbelief.</p>
</blockquote><figcaption>— Hebrews 4:4-6, 9-11</figcaption></figure><p data-search-id="paragraph-3">The Sabbath is a memorial of God as both Creator and Redeemer. Just as He rested from His work of creation on the seventh day, so Jesus rested from His work of redemption in the tomb. The Sabbath, therefore, is a sign of resting in Christ by faith in His completed work on my behalf. In other words, to deny the Sabbath is, in essence, to deny salvation by faith. Because I cannot sanctify or save myself, I am invited to cease striving for salvation by my own works and to rest in the righteous life of Jesus instead. By resting on the seventh day, I acknowledge this sublime truth.</p></section>

</blockquote><figcaption>— Luke 23:54-56</figcaption></figure><p data-search-id="paragraph-4">The Bible points out that, since it was the Day of Preparation (Friday) and the Sabbath was about to <a href="/basics/keeping/#when-does-the-sabbath-start-and-end">begin at sunset</a>, Jesus’ followers were so concerned about keeping the Sabbath that they even stopped their labor of love in preparing the body of their beloved Savior for burial. They rested on the Sabbath, as commanded, and returned early on Sunday morning to resume their unfinished work.</p></section>

</blockquote><figcaption>— John 20:1</figcaption></figure><p data-search-id="paragraph-5">It is important to note that Jesus’ followers returned to the tomb because they still had unfinished burial work to complete. Since they brought spices with them, it is evident they did not expect to find Him resurrected, so their Sunday morning labor of love was not an act of honoring His resurrection but rather a continuation of their burial work.</p></section>

<p>Now when Jesus was risen early the <em>first day of the week, he appeared first to Mary Magdalene</em>, out of whom he had cast seven devils. And she went and told them that had been with him, as they mourned and wept.</p>
</blockquote><figcaption>— Mark 16:9</figcaption></figure><figure data-search-id="blockquote-12"><blockquote>
<p>Jesus saith unto her, Woman, why weepest thou? whom seekest thou? She, supposing him to be the gardener, saith unto him, Sir, if thou have borne him hence, tell me where thou hast laid him, and I will take him away. Jesus saith unto her, Mary. She turned herself, and saith unto him, Rabboni; which is to say, Master. <em>Jesus saith unto her, Touch me not; for I am not yet ascended to my Father: but go to my brethren, and say unto them, I ascend unto my Father, and your Father; and to my God, and your God</em>. Mary Magdalene came and told the disciples that she had seen the Lord, and that he had spoken these things unto her.</p>
</blockquote><figcaption>— John 20:15-18</figcaption></figure><p data-search-id="paragraph-6">After His resurrection, Jesus had multiple opportunities to instruct His followers to keep Sunday as the new Sabbath in honor of His resurrection, but this He never did. When He appeared to Mary Magdalene that morning, there was no mention of Sunday at all. Considering the many Old Testament passages in which God directly commands the observance of the seventh-day Sabbath, one would reasonably expect at least one verse in the New Testament where Jesus—or His Father—commands His followers to keep Sunday instead. Yet no such verse exists. All we have is alleged circumstantial evidence, which, when closely examined, falls apart as well.</p></section>

For if we have been planted together in the likeness of his death, we shall be also in the likeness of his resurrection: knowing this, that <em>our old man is crucified with him, that the body of sin might be destroyed, that henceforth we should not serve sin</em>. For he that is dead is freed from sin. Now if we be dead with Christ, we believe that we shall also live with him.</p>
</blockquote><figcaption>— Romans 6:3-8</figcaption></figure><p data-search-id="paragraph-7">Jesus instituted <a href="/basics/baptism/">baptism by immersion</a> as a symbol of His death, burial, and resurrection.

Then said Jesus to them again, Peace be unto you: as my Father hath sent me, even so send I you.</p>

<p>Afterward he appeared unto the eleven as they sat at meat, and upbraided them with their unbelief and hardness of heart, <em>because they believed not them which had seen him after he was risen</em>.</p>
</blockquote><figcaption>— Mark 16:14</figcaption></figure><p data-search-id="paragraph-9">Mark tells us that after Jesus’ disciples heard He had risen, they did not at first believe the reports, so later that same day He appeared to them in person. Since they did not believe He had risen, they could not have gathered to honor His resurrection. Moreover, after He appeared, He had the perfect opportunity to declare Sunday holy, but—just as in His interaction with Mary—He did not do so. Finally, according to the Bible, days begin at sunset (<a href="https://bible-api.com/Genesis%201%3A5?translation=kjv" class="verse-link" data-reference="Genesis 1:5" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Genesis 1:5</a>); thus, biblically—and for the Jews—this Sunday evening gathering would actually have been Monday.</p></section>

The money was to be set aside privately, according to each person’s financial ability, and on a weekly basis rather than in a one-time donation, in order to encourage systematic giving. Nothing in these passages indicates that a worship gathering occurred on Sunday or that these offerings were collected during such a service.</p></section>

He that eateth, eateth to the Lord, for he giveth God thanks; and he that eateth not, to the Lord he eateth not, and giveth God thanks.</p>
</blockquote><figcaption>— Romans 14:5-6</figcaption></figure><p data-search-id="paragraph-11">Looking at the context, verse 1 shows that Paul is addressing “doubtful disputations” (<a href="https://bible-api.com/Romans%2014%3A1?translation=kjv" class="verse-link" data-reference="Romans 14:1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Romans 14:1</a>), meaning issues of personal preference related to ceremonial practices. Verses 2 and 3 offer further insight: the controversy was actually about fasting (<a href="https://bible-api.com/Romans%2014%3A2-3%2C%206?translation=kjv" class="verse-link" data-reference="Romans 14:2-3, 6" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Romans 14:2-3, 6</a>). Some Jewish Christians thought all believers were obligated to fast on specific days; by contrast, Gentile Christians, who were unfamiliar with such ceremonial observances, had a different view. Seeking reconciliation, Paul urged them to stop passing judgment on one another in these matters. The Sabbath, however, cannot be considered a “doubtful disputation,” since it is not part of the ceremonial law; rather, it belongs to God’s unchanging, moral law—the Ten Commandments—established at creation.</p></section>

<p><em>Let no man therefore judge you</em> in meat, or in drink, or in respect of a holyday [festival], or of the new moon, <em>or of the sabbath days</em>: which are a shadow of things to come; but the body is of Christ.</p>
</blockquote><figcaption>— Colossians 2:16-17</figcaption></figure><p data-search-id="paragraph-12">The fact that the passage mentions food, drink, festivals, and new moons in connection with “sabbath days” indicates that, once again, it is referring to the ceremonial laws. These are described as “a shadow of things to come” because they all pointed forward to Christ. When the veil of the temple was supernaturally torn from top to bottom at Christ’s death, God signified that these ceremonial laws had met their fulfillment in His Son and were no longer needed (<a href="https://bible-api.com/Ephesians%202%3A14-15?translation=kjv" class="verse-link" data-reference="Ephesians 2:14-15" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ephesians 2:14-15</a>), for the great sacrifice to which they all pointed had been made.</p><p data-search-id="paragraph-13">In contrast to the Ten Commandments, which were written by God Himself on stone and placed <em>inside</em> the ark of the covenant (<a href="https://bible-api.com/Deuteronomy%2010%3A3-5?translation=kjv" class="verse-link" data-reference="Deuteronomy 10:3-5" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Deuteronomy 10:3-5</a>), the ceremonial laws were written by Moses on parchment and placed <em>beside</em> the ark (<a href="https://bible-api.com/Deuteronomy%2031%3A24-26?translation=kjv" class="verse-link" data-reference="Deuteronomy 31:24-26" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Deuteronomy 31:24-26</a>). The “sabbath days” mentioned as part of the ceremonial law refer to the yearly sabbaths described in <a href="https://bible-api.com/Leviticus%2023%3A24-38?translation=kjv" class="verse-link" data-reference="Leviticus 23:24-38" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Leviticus 23:24-38</a>, not the weekly Sabbath that is part of the moral law. These annual sabbaths fell on specific days of the month each year (for example, the first, ninth, tenth, or fifteenth day), yet they were still called sabbaths because the people were to rest from their work on those days.</p></section>

<p>Think not that I am come to destroy the law, or the prophets: <em>I am not come to destroy, but to fulfil</em>. For verily I say unto you, till heaven and earth pass, <em>one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law</em>, till all be fulfilled.</p>
</blockquote><figcaption>— Matthew 5:17-18</figcaption></figure><p data-search-id="paragraph-15">There are no verses in the Bible showing that Jesus changed the fourth commandment to mean observing Sunday instead of Saturday, nor did He instruct others to do so later on. On the contrary, His mission was to fulfill the law and to uphold and expand it beyond the mere “letter” of the law to include the “spirit” of the law as well. For instance, Jesus expanded the commandment against adultery to include lust (<a href="https://bible-api.com/Matthew%205%3A28?translation=kjv" class="verse-link" data-reference="Matthew 5:28" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Matthew 5:28</a>) and the commandment against murder to include hatred (<a href="https://bible-api.com/Matthew%205%3A21-22?translation=kjv" class="verse-link" data-reference="Matthew 5:21-22" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Matthew 5:21-22</a>).</p><p data-search-id="paragraph-16">Law is the foundation of all government—both on earth and in heaven. Since Jesus does not change, His government, and therefore, His law, cannot change; otherwise, the wisdom, authority, and stability of His rule would immediately come into question. After all, if one of His commandments can change, why not the other nine? Most people agree with His prohibitions against having other gods, idolatry, blasphemy, dishonoring parents, murder, theft, adultery, bearing false witness, or covetousness. But what about the fourth commandment? Many acknowledge the need for weekly rest, yet the specific day on which to rest is often regarded as a matter of personal opinion.</p><p data-search-id="paragraph-17">The Sabbath commandment is the only one that establishes God’s authority to give the other nine—by the simple fact that we are the created and He is the Creator. Furthermore, without the fourth commandment, anyone could have given the other nine. The Sabbath, therefore, stands as <a href="/basics/sabbath/#which-commandment-identifies-the-creator-god">His signature</a> upon the entire Decalogue.</p><p data-search-id="paragraph-18">But does God really care about the day we honor? Yes, He does. Did He care about the tree from which Eve ate? Most definitely. Does He mean what He says? Absolutely. Ultimately, the day we choose to honor is both a test of obedience and a question of authority: whose authority will I acknowledge and submit to—God’s or someone else’s? It is a simple yet profound decision that every person must make.</p></section>
