<p>When the even was come, <em>there came a rich man of Arimathaea</em>, named Joseph, who also himself was Jesus’ disciple: He went to Pilate, and begged the body of Jesus. Then Pilate commanded the body to be delivered. And when Joseph had taken the body, he wrapped it in a clean linen cloth, And <em>laid it in his own new tomb</em>, which he had hewn out in the rock: and he rolled a great stone to the door of the sepulchre, and departed.</p>
