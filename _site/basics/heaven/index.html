Blessed are ye, when men shall revile you, and persecute you, and shall say all manner of evil against you falsely, for my sake. Rejoice, and be exceeding glad: for great is your reward in heaven: for so persecuted they the prophets which were before you.</p>
</blockquote><figcaption>— Matthew 5:3-12</figcaption></figure><figure><blockquote>
<p>Jesus answered and said unto him, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, <em>Except a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God</em>. Nicodemus saith unto him, How can a man be born when he is old? can he enter the second time into his mother’s womb, and be born? Jesus answered, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, <em>Except a man be born of water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God</em>.</p>
</blockquote><figcaption>— John 3:3</figcaption></figure><p>No one is born pure in heart, hungering and thirsting after rigtheousness because all have sinned (<a href="https://bible-api.com/Romans%203%3A23?translation=kjv" class="verse-link" data-reference="Romans 3:23" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Romans 3:23</a>). This is why Jesus said that no one can see the kingdom of God without being born again of the Spirit. So even though all have sinned, some, after learning about the love of Jesus, choose to put an end to the rebellion against Him in their lives. They make peace with Him by reaching out and taking His hand of mercy that offers forgiveness and imparts grace into their lives, restoring them into His image and fitting them for heaven. They surrender their hearts to Him and become the blessed ones of Matthew 5 who have been transformed by His love and made citizens of His kingdom (<a href="https://bible-api.com/Philippians%203%3A20?translation=kjv" class="verse-link" data-reference="Philippians 3:20" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Philippians 3:20</a>).</p></section>

<p>And I saw a new heaven and a new earth: for the first heaven and the first earth were passed away; and there was no more sea. And I John saw the <em>holy city, new Jerusalem, coming down from God out of heaven</em>, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband. And I heard a great voice out of heaven saying, Behold, the tabernacle of God is with men, and <em>he will dwell with them, and they shall be his people, and God himself shall be with them, and be their God</em>. And God shall <em>wipe away all tears from their eyes</em>; and there shall be <em>no more death, neither sorrow, nor crying, neither shall there be any more pain</em>: for the former things are passed away.

And because sin and its curse will be abolished (<a href="https://bible-api.com/Genesis%203%3A17-19?translation=kjv" class="verse-link" data-reference="Genesis 3:17-19" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Genesis 3:17-19</a>), God will be able to dwell among His children, never to be separated again! They will be able to commune with Him the way Adam and Eve did before sin entered the world: face-to-face! These passages also tell us that God did not create earth just to watch it be destroyed by sin. No, He will abolish sin, recreate earth, and make it even more glorious than it was in Eden! He will do the work which Adam, Eve, and their offspring would have done had they never sinned—to populate and build up the earth (<a href="https://bible-api.com/Genesis%201%3A28?translation=kjv" class="verse-link" data-reference="Genesis 1:28" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Genesis 1:28</a>).

The <em>length and the breadth and the height of it are equal</em>.

<p>And the building of the <em>wall of it was of jasper</em>: and the <em>city was pure gold</em>, like unto clear glass.

The distance around it is 12,000 furlongs or 1,500 miles (1 furlong is 1/8 of a mile), which means it’s 375 miles long each side! The streets are of pure gold, and the walls are 144 cubits or 216 feet of solid jasper—nearly 20 stories high—with 12 gates total, and each gate is of a single pearl. The city also has 12 foundations with each one of a different precious stone and color, so from a distance it will look like it’s resting upon a rainbow! When the New Jerusalem descends from heaven at the end of the <a href="/prophecy/millennium/">1,000 years</a>, it will rest on a great plain created for it by Jesus after He flattens the Mount of Olives (<a href="https://bible-api.com/Zechariah%2014%3A4-5?translation=kjv" class="verse-link" data-reference="Zechariah 14:4-5" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Zechariah 14:4-5</a>).</p></section>

The Bible is clear that my only hope of overcoming the defiling sin in my heart is through the power of Jesus working in my life. There is no other way. The whole reason why Jesus left the courts of heaven to live a life of victory on earth and die a humiliating death on the cross on my behalf is because He longs to save me from the filthiness of sin (<a href="https://bible-api.com/Matthew%201%3A21?translation=kjv" class="verse-link" data-reference="Matthew 1:21" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Matthew 1:21</a>).
