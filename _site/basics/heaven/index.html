</blockquote><figcaption>— Matthew 5:3-12</figcaption></figure>

<figure><blockquote>
<p>Jesus answered and said unto him, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, <em>Except a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God</em>. Nicodemus saith unto him, How can a man be born when he is old? can he enter the second time into his mother’s womb, and be born? Jesus answered, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, <em>Except a man be born of water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God</em>.</p>
</blockquote><figcaption>— John 3:3</figcaption></figure>

<p>No one is born pure in heart, hungering and thirsting after rigtheousness because all have sinned (<a href="https://bible-api.com/Romans%203%3A23?translation=kjv" class="verse-link" data-reference="Romans 3:23" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Romans 3:23</a>). This is why Jesus said that no one can see the kingdom of God without being born again of the Spirit. So even though all have sinned, some, after learning about the love of Jesus, choose to put an end to the rebellion against Him in their lives. They make peace with Him by reaching out and taking His hand of mercy that offers forgiveness and imparts grace into their lives, restoring them into His image and fitting them for heaven. They surrender their hearts to Him and become the blessed ones of Matthew 5 who have been transformed by His love and made citizens of His kingdom (<a href="https://bible-api.com/Philippians%203%3A20?translation=kjv" class="verse-link" data-reference="Philippians 3:20" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Philippians 3:20</a>).</p>

<p>And I saw a new heaven and a new earth: for the first heaven and the first earth were passed away; and there was no more sea. And I John saw the <em>holy city, new Jerusalem, coming down from God out of heaven</em>, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband. And I heard a great voice out of heaven saying, Behold, the tabernacle of God is with men, and <em>he will dwell with them, and they shall be his people, and God himself shall be with them, and be their God</em>. And God shall <em>wipe away all tears from their eyes</em>; and there shall be <em>no more death, neither sorrow, nor crying, neither shall there be any more pain</em>: for the former things are passed away. And he that sat upon the throne said, Behold, I make all things new. And he said unto me, Write: for these words are true and faithful.</p>

<figure><blockquote>

<p>As one of the most hope-filled passages in the entire Bible, (<a href="https://bible-api.com/Revelation%2021%3A3-4?translation=kjv" class="verse-link" data-reference="Revelation 21:3-4" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Revelation 21:3-4</a>) adds a lot more color to what Peter meant when he said that righteousness will dwell there. And because sin and its curse will be abolished (<a href="https://bible-api.com/Genesis%203%3A17-19?translation=kjv" class="verse-link" data-reference="Genesis 3:17-19" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Genesis 3:17-19</a>), God will be able to dwell among His children, never to be separated again! They will be able to commune with Him the way Adam and Eve did before sin entered the world: face-to-face! These passages also tell us that God did not create earth just to watch it be destroyed by sin. No, He will abolish sin, recreate earth, and make it even more glorious than it was in Eden! He will do the work which Adam, Eve, and their offspring would have done had they never sinned—to populate and build up the earth (<a href="https://bible-api.com/Genesis%201%3A28?translation=kjv" class="verse-link" data-reference="Genesis 1:28" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Genesis 1:28</a>). God will fill the earth with the people He redeemed, and He will establish the New Jerusalem as its capital!</p>

Then shall the lame man leap as a hart, and the tongue of the dumb sing</em>: for in the wilderness shall waters break out, and streams in the desert.</p>

<p>The saved will no longer have their mortal, earthly bodies because at Christ’s second coming they will receive new, immortal, and glorious bodies, like the body of Jesus, free from any trace of disease, abnormality, or blemish. Jesus had a real, physical body after His resurrection, and the saved will have a real, physical body in heaven too.</p>

Real people will be doing real things, and they will be enjoying the fruit of their labor, unlike on earth where hard work can end in disappointment, theft, or sudden destruction.

</blockquote><figcaption>— Isaiah 60:18-21</figcaption></figure>

<p>Vast oceans and deserts make up a large portion of the earth’s surface today, but that will no longer be the case in heaven. There will also be no night there because the brightness of God’s presence will permeate the whole earth. There will be no weariness after hard work, and the saved will be able to fly like the angels, maybe even visiting other unfallen worlds created by God (<a href="https://bible-api.com/Job%201%3A6?translation=kjv" class="verse-link" data-reference="Job 1:6" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Job 1:6</a>; <a href="https://bible-api.com/Hebrews%201%3A2?translation=kjv" class="verse-link" data-reference="Hebrews 1:2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hebrews 1:2</a>; <a href="https://bible-api.com/Hebrews%2011%3A3?translation=kjv" class="verse-link" data-reference="Hebrews 11:3" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">11:3</a>)! No destruction means there will be no natural disasters. And because heaven is a place where righteousness dwells, there will be nothing there that defiles, meaning no deception, no crime, no drunkenness, no brothels, no abuse, nor any other impurity. The righteous will be clothed with the righteousness of Jesus and will reflect His character of love!</p>

And <em>he measured the wall thereof, an hundred and forty and four cubits</em>, according to the measure of a man, that is, of the angel.</p>

<figure><blockquote>
<p>And the building of the <em>wall of it was of jasper</em>: and the <em>city was pure gold</em>, like unto clear glass. And the <em>foundations of the wall of the city were garnished with all manner of precious stones</em>. The first foundation was jasper; the second, sapphire; the third, a chalcedony; the fourth, an emerald; the fifth, sardonyx; the sixth, sardius; the seventh, chrysolite; the eighth, beryl; the ninth, a topaz; the tenth, a chrysoprasus; the eleventh, a jacinth; the twelfth, an amethyst. And the twelve gates were twelve pearls; <em>every several gate was of one pearl</em>: and the <em>street of the city was pure gold</em>, as it were transparent glass.</p>

<p>The city is arranged in a square with its width, length, and height equal. The distance around it is 12,000 furlongs or 1,500 miles (1 furlong is 1/8 of a mile), which means it’s 375 miles long each side! The streets are of pure gold, and the walls are 144 cubits or 216 feet of solid jasper—nearly 20 stories high—with 12 gates total, and each gate is of a single pearl. The city also has 12 foundations with each one of a different precious stone and color, so from a distance it will look like it’s resting upon a rainbow! When the New Jerusalem descends from heaven at the end of the <a href="/prophecy/millennium/">1,000 years</a>, it will rest on a great plain created for it by Jesus after He flattens the Mount of Olives (<a href="https://bible-api.com/Zechariah%2014%3A4-5?translation=kjv" class="verse-link" data-reference="Zechariah 14:4-5" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Zechariah 14:4-5</a>).</p>

<p>For I reckon that the <em>sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory</em> which shall be revealed in us.</p>
</blockquote><figcaption>— Romans 8:18</figcaption></figure>

<figure><blockquote>
<p>For which cause we faint not; but though our outward man perish, yet the inward man is renewed day by day. For <em>our light affliction, which is but for a moment, worketh for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory</em>; while we look not at the things which are seen, but at the things which are not seen: for the things which are seen are temporal; but the things which are not seen are eternal.</p>
</blockquote><figcaption>— 2 Corinthians 4:16-18</figcaption></figure>

<p>The joy, bliss, and glory of heaven will be beyond our wildest dreams; in fact, Paul writes that no matter the trials and sufferings that life on earth brings, they are not comparable with the eternal glory of heaven!</p>

<p>These are they which were not defiled with women; for they are virgins. These are they <em>which follow the Lamb whithersoever he goeth</em>. These were redeemed from among men, being the firstfruits unto God and to the Lamb.</p>

<figure><blockquote>
<p>And the Spirit and the bride say, Come. And let him that heareth say, Come. And <em>let him that is athirst come</em>. And <em>whosoever will, let him take the water of life freely</em>.</p>
</blockquote><figcaption>— Revelation 22:17</figcaption></figure>

<p>Those who overcome sin will inherit all things. And how do they overcome? By the blood of the Lamb. The Bible is clear that my only hope of overcoming the defiling sin in my heart is through the power of Jesus working in my life. There is no other way. The whole reason why Jesus left the courts of heaven to live a life of victory on earth and die a humiliating death on the cross on my behalf is because He longs to save me from the filthiness of sin (<a href="https://bible-api.com/Matthew%201%3A21?translation=kjv" class="verse-link" data-reference="Matthew 1:21" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Matthew 1:21</a>). And He gives this offer of salvation freely. Will I choose to renounce sin and follow the Lamb wherever He goes?</p>

<p>In those days came John the Baptist, preaching in the wilderness of Judaea, and saying, <em>Repent ye: for the kingdom of heaven is at hand</em>.</p>
</blockquote><figcaption>— Matthew 3:1-2</figcaption></figure>

<figure><blockquote>
<p>And when he was demanded of the Pharisees, when the kingdom of God should come, he answered them and said, The kingdom of God cometh not with observation: neither shall they say, Lo here! or, lo there! for, behold, <em>the kingdom of God is within you</em>.</p>

<figure><blockquote>
<p>But <em>seek ye first the kingdom of God, and his righteousness</em>; and all these things shall be added unto you.</p>
</blockquote><figcaption>— Matthew 6:33</figcaption></figure>

<figure><blockquote>
<p><em>Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done</em> in earth, as it is in heaven.</p>
</blockquote><figcaption>— Matthew 6:10</figcaption></figure>

<p>When John the Baptist said the kingdom of God is “at hand,” he meant that the spiritual kingdom is already available now! I can experience the love, joy, and peace of God’s spiritual kingdom in my life today when I accept Jesus and give Him the throne of my heart! If seeking His kingdom and righteousness becomes my first priority in life, He will provide everything else for me. May the prayer of Jesus in (<a href="https://bible-api.com/Matthew%206%3A10?translation=kjv" class="verse-link" data-reference="Matthew 6:10" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Matthew 6:10</a>) be the prayer of my heart every day of my life.</p>
