</blockquote><figcaption>— 1 Corinthians 2:13-14</figcaption></figure><p>Because spiritual things are spiritually discerned and because the Bible is full of stories with symbolism, I need the Holy Spirit to open my spiritual eyes and help me bring these stories to life.

</blockquote><figcaption>— Isaiah 28:9-10</figcaption></figure><p>God is not a God of contradiction or confusion, so it’s important to not take verses out of context and build a doctrine based on a verse or two. When studying a particular topic, it’s critical to identify as many verses as possible dealing with the topic and to let the Bible clarify itself on what seem, due to our misunderstanding, like contradictory ones.</p></section>
