That which is pleasing is practiced, and that which is displeasing is discontinued. The same is true in our relationship with Jesus.

<p>Now when they saw the boldness of Peter and John, and perceived that they were unlearned and ignorant men, they marvelled; and <em>they took knowledge of them, that they had been with Jesus</em>.</p>

<p>Go through, go through the gates; prepare ye the way of the people; cast up, cast up the highway; gather out the stones; <em>lift up a standard for the people</em>.</p>
</blockquote><figcaption>— Isaiah 62:10</figcaption></figure><p>Those who become followers of Christ become His ambassadors, representing Him wherever they go, whether in the family, at school, at work, or on vacation. Words and actions not only testify if the heart belongs to Christ, but they also have an influence on others. Jesus gave a solemn warning to Christians who are indifferent to their own example and influence (<a href="https://bible-api.com/Matthew%2018%3A6?translation=kjv" class="verse-link" data-reference="Matthew 18:6" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Matthew 18:6</a>) as did Paul (<a href="https://bible-api.com/Romans%2014%3A7%2C%2013?translation=kjv" class="verse-link" data-reference="Romans 14:7, 13" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Romans 14:7, 13</a>). When people saw the conduct of Peter and John it was obvious to them that they were different because they had been with Jesus. May our walk with Christ transform us in like manner to reflect His character to those we come in contact with (<a href="https://bible-api.com/Matthew%205%3A16?translation=kjv" class="verse-link" data-reference="Matthew 5:16" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Matthew 5:16</a>).</p></section>

<p><em>Love not the world, neither the things that are in the world. If any man love the world, the love of the Father is not in him</em>. For all that is in the world, the lust of the flesh, and the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life, is not of the Father, but is of the world. And the world passeth away, and the lust thereof: but he that doeth the will of God abideth for ever.</p>
</blockquote><figcaption>— 1 John 2:15-17</figcaption></figure><p>Every sin falls into one of three categories: 1) the lust of the flesh, 2) the lust of the eyes, or 3) the pride of life. These are the avenues through which Satan works to awaken in us a love for the world. Because we cannot serve two masters (<a href="https://bible-api.com/Matthew%206%3A24?translation=kjv" class="verse-link" data-reference="Matthew 6:24" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Matthew 6:24</a>), a love for the world decreases our love for God, whose principles are the exact opposite of those in the world, which is why James says that lovers of the world become enemies of God (<a href="https://bible-api.com/James%204%3A4?translation=kjv" class="verse-link" data-reference="James 4:4" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">James 4:4</a>).

</blockquote><figcaption>— Romans 12:1-2</figcaption></figure><p>Living in a world of sin brings pressure to conform to its ways, to be squeezed into its mold, but God’s goal is to transform us by renewing our minds through the truth of His Word (<a href="https://bible-api.com/John%2017%3A17?translation=kjv" class="verse-link" data-reference="John 17:17" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">John 17:17</a>).</p></section>

</blockquote><figcaption>— 2 Corinthians 3:18</figcaption></figure><p>Thoughts turn into words, which turn into actions, which turn into habits, which become a part of character. Satan knows that we become what we repeatedly behold, which is why he has a myriad of ways to influence our thoughts through our five senses, but especially sight and hearing. Because we become what we see and hear, we are invited to behold the glory of God’s character by daily reading His letter to us—the Bible—so that we may become more like Him.</p></section>

</blockquote><figcaption>— Philippians 4:7-8</figcaption></figure><figure><blockquote>
<p>Casting down imaginations, and every high thing that exalteth itself against the knowledge of God, and <em>bringing into captivity every thought to the obedience of Christ</em>.</p>
</blockquote><figcaption>— 2 Corinthians 10:5</figcaption></figure><figure><blockquote>
<p>Now the works of the flesh are manifest, which are these; <em>adultery, fornication, uncleanness, lasciviousness, idolatry, witchcraft, hatred, variance, emulations, wrath, strife, seditions, heresies, envyings, murders, drunkenness, revellings, and such like</em>: of the which I tell you before, as I have also told you in time past, that they which do such things shall not inherit the kingdom of God. But <em>the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, longsuffering, gentleness, goodness, faith, meekness, temperance</em>: against such there is no law. And they that are Christ’s have crucified the flesh with the affections and lusts.</p>
</blockquote><figcaption>— Galatians 5:19-24</figcaption></figure><p>The above verses makes it clear there is little in modern entertainment that is fit for a Christian to watch. The list Paul provides in Philippians on the kind of thoughts we are to think about has implications on what a Christian will choose to avoid:</p><ul>
<li>Dishonesty: lying, cheating, stealing, betrayal, or injustice.</li>
<li>Impurity: profanity, pornography, fornication, adultery, homosexuality, and watching or listening to anything that’s debasing.</li>
</ul><p>It’s unfortunate, but the lyrics of most secular songs glorify immoral behavior and numb our desire for spiritual things. Music is powerful because it bypasses the frontal lobe, the reasoning part of our brain, thereby appealing primarily to our emotions. It affects every function of the body, including pulse, breathing, and reflexes, but repetitive and syncopated rhythms, especially, alter mood and brain wave patterns, sending the listener into a type of hypnosis. At its best, music can be refreshing and uplifting, like it was to Saul when David played his harp (<a href="https://bible-api.com/1%20Samuel%2016%3A23?translation=kjv" class="verse-link" data-reference="1 Samuel 16:23" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">1 Samuel 16:23</a>), but at its worst, it can be very degrading. Jesus wants to redeem us from the degradation of sin, and when we choose to follow Him, He will lead us to music that elevates, inspires, and refreshes. (For a deep dive into music, see the <em>Distraction Dilemma</em> seminar by Christian Berdahl.)</p><p>Besides music, there is a second avenue into our mind: the things we watch. Do the TV shows, movies, and internet videos we watch increase our love for Jesus or the world? Do they promote the principles of His kingdom or those of the world? It’s no secret that the majority of modern entertainment falls into the latter category, and it is having an affect on society. One study found that without television “there would be 10,000 fewer murders per year in the United States, 70,000 fewer rapes, and 700,000 fewer assaults.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">[1]</a></sup> Time is finite and precious, so instead of beholding these vices, Jesus invites us to behold Him through, and be blessed by, the reading and study of His Word (<a href="https://bible-api.com/Isaiah%2045%3A22?translation=kjv" class="verse-link" data-reference="Isaiah 45:22" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Isaiah 45:22</a>).</p></section>

<p>In like manner also, that the women adorn themselves <em>in modest apparel, with propriety and moderation</em>, not with braided hair or gold or pearls or costly clothing, but, which is proper for women professing godliness, with good works.</p>
</blockquote><figcaption>— 1 Timothy 2:9-10, NKJV</figcaption></figure><p>God’s counsel regarding clothing, which applies to both men and women, is modesty, propriety, and moderation. The key word is moderation, which means we are to avoid expensive clothes, but we are not to dress in sackcloth either. Our clothing should be clean, neat, and modest.</p></section>

<p>Then Jacob said unto his household, and to all that were with him, Put away the strange gods that are among you, and be clean, and change your garments: and let us arise, and go up to Bethel; and I will make there an altar unto God, who answered me in the day of my distress, and was with me in the way which I went. <em>And they gave unto Jacob all the strange gods which were in their hand, and all their earrings which were in their ears</em>; and Jacob hid them under the oak which was by Shechem.</p>

For the LORD had said unto Moses, Say unto the children of Israel, Ye are a stiffnecked people: I will come up into the midst of thee in a moment, and consume thee: therefore now put off thy ornaments from thee, that I may know what to do unto thee. <em>And the children of Israel stripped themselves of their ornaments by the mount Horeb</em>.</p>
</blockquote><figcaption>— Exodus 33:3-6</figcaption></figure><p>In the Bible jewelry is associated with idolatry, backsliding, apostasy, and forgetting God. By its very nature, jewelry draws attention to and exalts self, thus appealing to pride (<a href="https://bible-api.com/1%20John%202%3A16?translation=kjv" class="verse-link" data-reference="1 John 2:16" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">1 John 2:16</a>). The putting away of jewelry, on the other hand, is associated with repentance and turning back to God. For example, when Jacob chose to rededicate his life to God, he told his family to destroy their idols and to remove their jewelry. When the Israelites mourned their apostasy of worshiping the golden calf, God told them to put away their jewelry, and they did.</p></section>

So he carried me away in the spirit into the wilderness: and I saw a woman sit upon a scarlet coloured beast, full of names of blasphemy, having seven heads and ten horns. And the woman was arrayed in purple and scarlet colour, and <em>decked with gold and precious stones and pearls, having a golden cup in her hand full of abominations and filthiness of her fornication</em>: and upon her forehead was a name written, MYSTERY, BABYLON THE GREAT, THE MOTHER OF HARLOTS AND ABOMINATIONS OF THE EARTH.</p>

<p>Thou believest that there is one God; thou doest well: the devils also believe, and tremble. But wilt thou know, O vain man, that <em>faith without works is dead</em>? Was not Abraham our father justified by works, when he had offered Isaac his son upon the altar? Seest thou <em>how faith wrought with his works, and by works was faith made perfect</em>? And the scripture was fulfilled which saith, Abraham believed God, and it was imputed unto him for righteousness: and he was called the Friend of God.

<p>Even so <em>every good tree bringeth forth good fruit; but a corrupt tree bringeth forth evil fruit</em>.

</blockquote><figcaption>— Matthew 7:17-20</figcaption></figure><p>We obey Him <em>because</em> we are saved, not <em>to be</em> saved.

For a person who genuinely loves Christ it’s a joy to discover His will in the Bible and to follow it in all areas of life. A conversion without a transformation of character or change in lifestyle, on the other hand, is most likely not genuine because faith without works is dead. A tree is known by its fruit, and genuine faith will produce a life that is obedient to Christ in an expression of love for Him.</p></section>

The world lacks spiritual discernment, so it will consider the things of God as foolishness. In fact, uncoverted people would be find heaven a bore because their love for worldy things could never be satisfied.
