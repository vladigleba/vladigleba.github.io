<figure><blockquote>
<p>And when he saw their faith, he said unto him, Man, <em>thy sins are forgiven thee</em>. ... But that ye may know that the Son of man hath power upon earth to forgive sins, (he said unto the sick of the palsy,) <em>I say unto thee, Arise, and take up thy couch</em>, and go into thine house.</p>
</blockquote><figcaption>— Luke 5:20, 24</figcaption></figure>

<p>Jesus wants to sanctify me wholly, including mind, body, and spirit. He did not just forgive the sins of the paralytic, but He also healed him from the disease, and He wants the same complete healing for me as well.</p>

</blockquote><figcaption>— 1 Corinthians 6:19, 20</figcaption></figure>

<p>My body belongs to God because 1) He created it, and 2) He redeemed it at the cross. It is to be a temple of the Holy Spirit, enabling me to bring Him glory in my body and spirit!</p>

</blockquote><figcaption>— Romans 12:1, 2</figcaption></figure>

<p>God calls on me to present my body as a living and holy sacrifice to Him—my Maker and Redeemer. Then I am to be transformed by the renewing of my mind (note the tight connection between the body and mind). Once more, Jesus does not just want to forgive my sins; He wants to cleanse, heal, and restore His image in me by wholly transforming me!</p>

<figure><blockquote>
<p><em>Ask, and it shall be given you</em>; seek, and ye shall find; knock, and it shall be opened unto you: for every one that asketh receiveth; and he that seeketh findeth; and to him that knocketh it shall be opened.</p>
</blockquote><figcaption>— Matthew 7:7, 8</figcaption></figure>

<p>Paul invites me to bring God glory in everything that I do, including the things I eat and drink. This is a high standard that I cannot reach in my own power, but God has made ample provision for this to become a reality in my life by the grace and power of Christ, as long as I do not frustrate His grace with a perverse will. If I ask Jesus to help me live a life that glorifies Him then He will gladly answer that prayer. And because God is love (<a href="https://bible-api.com/1%20John%204%3A8?translation=kjv" class="verse-link" data-reference="1 John 4:8" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">1 John 4:8</a>), His glory is my good.</p>

<p><em>Wine is a mocker, strong drink is raging</em>: and whosoever is deceived thereby is not wise.</p>
</blockquote><figcaption>— Proverbs 20:1</figcaption></figure>

<figure><blockquote>
<p>Who hath woe? who hath sorrow? who hath contentions? who hath babbling? who hath wounds without cause? who hath redness of eyes? They that tarry long at the wine; they that go to seek mixed wine. <em>Look not thou upon the wine</em> when it is red, when it giveth his colour in the cup, when it moveth itself aright. <em>At the last it biteth like a serpent, and stingeth like an adder</em>.</p>
</blockquote><figcaption>— Proverbs 23:29-32</figcaption></figure>

<figure><blockquote>
<p><em>Woe unto them</em> that rise up early in the morning, <em>that they may follow strong drink</em>; that continue until night, till wine inflame them!</p>
</blockquote><figcaption>— Isaiah 5:11</figcaption></figure>

<figure><blockquote>
<p>For they eat the bread of wickedness, and <em>drink the wine of violence</em>.</p>
</blockquote><figcaption>— Proverbs 4:17</figcaption></figure>

<p>The Bible is clear and direct in its condemnation of wine and other alcoholic beverages, and science is now agreeing too. Studies have shown that alcohol is toxic to the cells and no amount is actually safe. Wine does contain beneficial flavonoids that help fight free radicals in the body, but so does grape juice!</p>

<p>It is not for kings, O Lemuel, <em>it is not for kings to drink wine; nor for princes strong drink</em>: lest they drink, and forget the law, and pervert the judgment of any of the afflicted.</p>
</blockquote><figcaption>— Proverbs 31:4, 5</figcaption></figure>

<figure><blockquote>
<p>And they sung a new song, saying, Thou art worthy to take the book, and to open the seals thereof: for thou wast slain, and hast redeemed us to God by thy blood out of every kindred, and tongue, and people, and nation; and hast <em>made us unto our God kings and priests</em>: and we shall reign on the earth.</p>
</blockquote><figcaption>— Revelation 5:9, 10</figcaption></figure>

<figure><blockquote>
<p>Wherefore <em>gird up the loins of your mind, be sober</em>, and hope to the end for the grace that is to be brought unto you at the revelation of Jesus Christ.</p>
</blockquote><figcaption>— 1 Peter 1:13</figcaption></figure>

<figure><blockquote>
<p>Finally, my brethren, be strong in the Lord, and in the power of his might. Put on the whole armour of God, that ye may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil. <em>For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places</em>.</p>
</blockquote><figcaption>— Ephesians 6:10-12</figcaption></figure>

<p>Proverbs plainly says that alcoholic drinks pervert the judgment, and as such, they are not suitable for kings and princes. In Revelation we learn that we are made to be kings and priests to God, which is why Peter calls us to be sober, to bind the mind for action, like a soldier binds his belt in preparation for battle, because our battle is not with flesh and blood; it’s a battle with spiritual forces, and the outcome has eternal consequences.</p>

<p>The original diet in Eden was a whole foods diet composed of plants that yield seeds. Root vegetables were added later after the fall of Adam and Eve.</p>

<figure><blockquote>
<p><em>Every moving thing that lives shall be food for you</em>. I have given you all things, even as the green herbs. But <em>you shall not eat flesh with its life, that is, its blood</em>.</p>
</blockquote><figcaption>— Genesis 9:3, 4, NKJV</figcaption></figure>

<p>Meat was added to the diet after the flood because when Noah stepped off the ark all the vegetation had been destroyed. But God made a distinction between clean and unclean animals because seven pairs of every clean animal came onto the ark and only two pairs of the unclean, so Noah and his family were allowed to eat every clean animal, as long as the blood was drained.</p>

Nevertheless these shall ye not eat of them that chew the cud, or of them that divide the hoof: as the camel, because he cheweth the cud, but divideth not the hoof; he is unclean unto you. And the coney, because he cheweth the cud, but divideth not the hoof; he is unclean unto you. And the hare, because he cheweth the cud, but divideth not the hoof; he is unclean unto you. And the swine, though he divide the hoof, and be clovenfooted, yet he cheweth not the cud; he is unclean to you. Of their flesh shall ye not eat, and their carcase shall ye not touch; they are unclean to you.</p>
<p>These shall ye eat of all that are in the waters: <em>whatsoever hath fins and scales in the waters, in the seas, and in the rivers, them shall ye eat</em>. And all that have not fins and scales in the seas, and in the rivers, of all that move in the waters, and of any living thing which is in the waters, they shall be an abomination unto you: they shall be even an abomination unto you; ye shall not eat of their flesh, but ye shall have their carcases in abomination. Whatsoever hath no fins nor scales in the waters, that shall be an abomination unto you.</p>
</blockquote><figcaption>— Leviticus 11:1-12</figcaption></figure>

<p>The unclean animals are scavengers and bottom feeders; some examples include cats, dogs, horses, camels, eagles, vultures, hogs, squirrels, rabbits, catfish, eels, lobsters, clams, crabs, shrimp, oysters, and frogs. These laws are not just for the Jewish nation because Noah was not Jewish, and they were not done away with at the cross because our physiology did not change at the cross. If these were unfit for human consumption before the cross then they are still unfit today.</p>

<p>And said, If thou wilt diligently hearken to the voice of the LORD thy God, and wilt do that which is right in his sight, and wilt give ear to his commandments, and keep all his statutes, I will put none of these diseases upon thee, which I have brought upon the Egyptians: <em>for I am the LORD that healeth thee</em>.</p>

<figure><blockquote>
<p>Thou wilt shew me the path of life: <em>in thy presence is fulness of joy; at thy right hand there are pleasures for evermore</em>.</p>
</blockquote><figcaption>— Psalm 16:11</figcaption></figure>

<p>We are not to consume unclean animals because they are detrimental to our health. God’s mission is to bring healing into our bodies and minds, so He never withholds anything that is good for us. He is also far better at pleasure and happiness than Satan because His way does not lead to a crash after the high, or desensitization that requires increasingly higher doses, or addiction. It may seem difficult, overwhelming, or even impossible to make these dietary changes, but when I don’t have the willpower myself, I can give Him my will, and He will give me the power.</p>

<p>On the morrow, as they went on their journey, and drew nigh unto the city, Peter went up upon the housetop to pray about the sixth hour: and he became very hungry, and would have eaten: but while they made ready, he fell into a trance, and saw heaven opened, and a certain vessel descending unto him, as it had been a great sheet knit at the four corners, and let down to the earth: wherein were all manner of fourfooted beasts of the earth, and wild beasts, and creeping things, and fowls of the air. And there came a voice to him, Rise, Peter; kill, and eat. But Peter said, <em>Not so, Lord; for I have never eaten any thing that is common or unclean</em>. And the voice spake unto him again the second time, What God hath cleansed, that call not thou common. This was done thrice: and the vessel was received up again into heaven.</p>

<p>And he said unto them, Ye know how that it is an unlawful thing for a man that is a Jew to keep company, or come unto one of another nation; but <em>God hath shewed me that I should not call any man common or unclean</em>.</p>
</blockquote><figcaption>— Acts 10:28</figcaption></figure>

<p>The subject of Peter’s vision was people, not animals. God was telling him that he should not view Gentiles as unclean because he was about to have Gentile visitors, whom he would have refused to see, as Jewish law forbade associating with Gentiles (<a href="https://bible-api.com/Acts%2010%3A28?translation=kjv" class="verse-link" data-reference="Acts 10:28" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Acts 10:28</a>), but after receiving this vision, Peter welcomed them.</p>

</blockquote><figcaption>— Ezekiel 33:11</figcaption></figure>

<p>God cannot save those who knowingly go down the path of destruction, nor does He enjoy destroying them, but eventually there will come a point when He can do nothing else but leave them to the consequences of their own destructive choices.</p>
