<p>Go ye therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and <em>of the Holy Ghost</em>: teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you: and, lo, I am with you alway, even unto the end of the world. Amen.</p>
</blockquote><figcaption>— Matthew 28:19-20</figcaption></figure><figure><blockquote>
<p>The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the <em>communion of the Holy Ghost</em>, be with you all.</p>
</blockquote><figcaption>— 2 Corinthians 13:14</figcaption></figure><p>The Holy Spirit is part of the Godhead, also referred to as the Trinity, that consists of three distinct Persons: the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. These three Persons are united in perfect harmony as one God (<a href="https://bible-api.com/Isaiah%2046%3A9?translation=kjv" class="verse-link" data-reference="Isaiah 46:9" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Isaiah 46:9</a>). In the Old Testament there are multiple instances where this unity in plurality is shown (<a href="https://bible-api.com/Genesis%201%3A26?translation=kjv" class="verse-link" data-reference="Genesis 1:26" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Genesis 1:26</a>; <a href="https://bible-api.com/Genesis%203%3A22?translation=kjv" class="verse-link" data-reference="Genesis 3:22" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">3:22</a>; <a href="https://bible-api.com/Genesis%2011%3A7?translation=kjv" class="verse-link" data-reference="Genesis 11:7" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">11:7</a>; <a href="https://bible-api.com/Isaiah%206%3A8?translation=kjv" class="verse-link" data-reference="Isaiah 6:8" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Isaiah 6:8</a>). Another example is Jesus’ baptism, when all three members of the Godhead were present: the Son of God was baptized, the Father spoke, and the Holy Spirit descended (<a href="https://bible-api.com/Matthew%203%3A16-17?translation=kjv" class="verse-link" data-reference="Matthew 3:16-17" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Matthew 3:16-17</a>).</p></section>

Whiles it remained, was it not thine own? and after it was sold, was it not in thine own power? why hast thou conceived this thing in thine heart? <em>thou hast not lied unto men, but unto God</em>.</p>
</blockquote><figcaption>— Acts 5:3-4</figcaption></figure><figure><blockquote>
<p>Howbeit <em>when he, the Spirit</em> of truth, is come, he will guide you into all truth: for he shall not speak of himself; but whatsoever he shall hear, that shall he speak: and he will shew you things to come.</p>
</blockquote><figcaption>— John 16:13</figcaption></figure><figure><blockquote>
<p>And he that searcheth the hearts knoweth what is the <em>mind of the Spirit</em>, because he maketh intercession for the saints according to the will of God.</p>
</blockquote><figcaption>— Romans 8:27</figcaption></figure><p>Peter made it clear that the Holy Spirit is not only God, but He can also be lied to, which means He’s a Person with a personality, not an impersonal “force.” Paul confirmed this when he stated that the Spirit has a mind. Jesus, also, referred to the Spirit as “He”—an individual Being who works in harmony with the Godhead.</p></section>

</blockquote><figcaption>— John 16:7</figcaption></figure><figure><blockquote>
<p>And I will pray the Father, and <em>he shall give you another Comforter, that he may abide with you for ever</em>. Even the Spirit of truth; whom the world cannot receive, because it seeth him not, neither knoweth him: but ye know him; for <em>he dwelleth with you, and shall be in you. I will not leave you comfortless: I will come to you</em>.</p>
</blockquote><figcaption>— John 14:16-17</figcaption></figure><figure><blockquote>
<p>And he that keepeth his commandments dwelleth in him, and he in him. And hereby we know that he abideth in us, <em>by the Spirit which he hath given us</em>.</p>
</blockquote><figcaption>— 1 John 3:24</figcaption></figure><p>Jesus promised that after His ascension He would send us the Comforter, the Holy Spirit, who’s abiding presence would comfort us. Notice also that when Jesus said the Holy Spirit would dwell in us, He followed that up with “I will come to you,” meaning Jesus equates the presence of the Spirit with His own presence! He Himself lives and abides in us through the Holy Spirit. When Jesus was on earth, people wanting to be with Him had to physically seek Him out, but we no longer have these limitations! Jesus can be anywhere and with anyone through the Person of the Holy Spirit.</p></section>

<p>But the Comforter, which is the Holy Ghost, whom the Father will send in my name, <em>he shall teach you all things</em>, and bring all things to your remembrance, whatsoever I have said unto you.</p>
</blockquote><figcaption>— John 14:26</figcaption></figure><figure><blockquote>
<p>Now we have received, not the spirit of the world, but the spirit which is of God; <em>that we might know the things that are freely given to us of God</em>. Which things also we speak, not in the words which man’s wisdom teacheth, but which the Holy Ghost teacheth; comparing spiritual things with spiritual. But <em>the natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God: for they are foolishness unto him: neither can he know them, because they are spiritually discerned</em>.</p>
</blockquote><figcaption>— 1 Corinthians 2:12-14</figcaption></figure><p>Paul tells us that spiritual things are spiritually discerned (<a href="https://bible-api.com/1%20Corinthians%202%3A14?translation=kjv" class="verse-link" data-reference="1 Corinthians 2:14" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">1 Corinthians 2:14</a>), so one of the roles of the Holy Spirit is to teach and guide those studying the Bible into an understanding of its beautiful, freely given, truths because the Bible was written under the inspiration of the Spirit (<a href="https://bible-api.com/2%20Timothy%203%3A16?translation=kjv" class="verse-link" data-reference="2 Timothy 3:16" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2 Timothy 3:16</a>; <a href="https://bible-api.com/2%20Peter%201%3A21?translation=kjv" class="verse-link" data-reference="2 Peter 1:21" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2 Peter 1:21</a>). Without the aid of the Spirit, the Bible cannot be understood, which is why it’s crucial to pray for the Holy Spirit’s guidance whenever we read it. Notice also that John says the Spirit does not speak independently of Jesus; on the contrary, He’s in harmony with the teachings of Jesus, working to give us an understanding of them.</p></section>

</blockquote><figcaption>— Romans 8:26-27</figcaption></figure><p>The Holy Spirit reproves, or brings conviction, of sin, of righteousness, and of judgment. In other words, He identifies what is right and wrong in the sight of God, enabling us to experience spiritual growth and an increased love of God, His righteousness, and holy living. Put simply, the Holy Spirit is the catalyst that brings power, victory, and life to the Christian walk. These life changes might seem impossible to us, but, if we are willing to cooperate with the Holy Spirit, nothing is impossible to God (<a href="https://bible-api.com/Mark%2010%3A26-27?translation=kjv" class="verse-link" data-reference="Mark 10:26-27" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mark 10:26-27</a>; <a href="https://bible-api.com/Philippians%202%3A13?translation=kjv" class="verse-link" data-reference="Philippians 2:13" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Philippians 2:13</a>).</p><p>The Holy Spirit also testifies of Jesus, revealing His character and truth to us, which, if received, has the power to sanctify our own characters (<a href="https://bible-api.com/John%2014%3A6?translation=kjv" class="verse-link" data-reference="John 14:6" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">John 14:6</a>; <a href="https://bible-api.com/John%2017%3A17?translation=kjv" class="verse-link" data-reference="John 17:17" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">17:17</a>). And whenever we pray, it’s the Holy Spirit who inspires our petitions, if we let Him, so that they are in accordance to God’s will.</p></section>

<p><em>Let this mind be in you</em>, which was also in Christ Jesus.</p>
</blockquote><figcaption>— Philippians 2:5</figcaption></figure><p>All I need to do to receive the Holy Spirit is ask God for it! He wants to bestow the Holy Spirit on all, but He will not do it against anyone’s will, which is why I need to ask. Asking only comes after there’s been a realization of my need of the Spirit, which means there is a heart that’s surrendered to God, dead to self, willing to receive. Paul uses the word “let” to describe the process of receiving the mind of Christ, meaning there is a willingness to yield—to surrender—to the sanctifying work of the Holy Spirit. And it truly is His work, not ours, because we cannot change ourselves, but we must be willing to cooperate with Him.</p></section>

The wind bloweth where it listeth [wishes], and thou hearest the sound thereof, but canst not tell whence it cometh, and whither it goeth: so is every one that is born of the Spirit.</p>
</blockquote><figcaption>— John 3:5-8</figcaption></figure><p>Just like the Holy Spirit participated in the work of creation on that first week, He participates in the work of recreating the heart, renewing the mind, and transforming the character after the likeness of Jesus. When the Holy Spirit dwells in us, He will give us a new heart, enabling us to keep God’s commandments and live a genuine, victorious, joyful Christian life. This transplant of the heart is what Jesus referred to when He told Nicodemus that no one can enter the kingdom of God unless born of the Spirit. Like the movement of the wind, the work of the Holy Spirit upon the heart is a mystery to us, but just like the movement of the wind is made evident by its sound, the work of the Spirit will be made evident by its fruits in a person’s life.</p></section>

<p>For to one is given by the Spirit the word of <em>wisdom</em>; to another the word of <em>knowledge</em> by the same Spirit; to another <em>faith</em> by the same Spirit; to another the gifts of <em>healing</em> by the same Spirit; to another the <em>working of miracles</em>; to another <em>prophecy</em>; to another <em>discerning of spirits</em>; to another <em>divers kinds of tongues</em>; to another the <em>interpretation of tongues</em>: but all these worketh that one and the selfsame Spirit, <em>dividing to every man severally [separately] as he will</em>.</p>

        </svg></a></h2><figure><blockquote>
<p>And they were all filled with the Holy Ghost, and <em>began to speak with other tongues</em>, as the Spirit gave them utterance. And there were dwelling at Jerusalem Jews, devout men, <em>out of every nation under heaven</em>. Now when this was noised abroad, the multitude came together, and were confounded, because that <em>every man heard them speak in his own language</em>.</p>
<p>And they were all amazed and marvelled, saying one to another, Behold, are not all these which speak Galilaeans? And <em>how hear we every man in our own tongue, wherein we were born</em>? Parthians, and Medes, and Elamites, and the dwellers in Mesopotamia, and in Judaea, and Cappadocia, in Pontus, and Asia, Phrygia, and Pamphylia, in Egypt, and in the parts of Libya about Cyrene, and strangers of Rome, Jews and proselytes, Cretes and Arabians, we do hear them speak in our tongues the wonderful works of God.</p>
</blockquote><figcaption>— Acts 2:4-11</figcaption></figure><figure><blockquote>
<p>So likewise ye, except ye <em>utter by the tongue words easy to be understood</em>, how shall it be known what is spoken? for ye shall speak into the air. … Yet in the church I had rather speak five words with my understanding, that by my voice I might teach others also, <em>than ten thousand words in an unknown tongue</em>. …</p>
<p>If any man speak in an unknown tongue, let it be by two, or at the most by three, and that by course; and <em>let one interpret</em>. But <em>if there be no interpreter, let him keep silence in the church</em>; and let him speak to himself, and to God. Let the prophets speak two or three, and let the other judge. If any thing be revealed to another that sitteth by, let the first hold his peace. For ye may all prophesy one by one, that all may learn, and all may be comforted. And the spirits of the prophets are subject to the prophets. <em>For God is not the author of confusion</em>, but of peace, as in all churches of the saints.</p>
</blockquote><figcaption>— 1 Corinthians 14:9, 19, 27-33</figcaption></figure><figure><blockquote>
<p><em>But ye shall receive power, after that the Holy Ghost is come upon you: and ye shall be witnesses unto me</em> both in Jerusalem, and in all Judaea, and in Samaria, and unto the uttermost part of the earth.</p>
</blockquote><figcaption>— Acts 1:8</figcaption></figure><p>Jesus said that the gifts and the filling of the Holy Spirit are for the purpose of witnessing to other people. This was examplified at Pentacost because one of the gifts of the Spirit was an ability to speak other tongues, or languages, and since there were people present in Jerusalem from other nations, the gift was needed so that the gospel could be communicated without any language barriers. The book of Acts mentions tongues only three times (<a href="https://bible-api.com/Acts%202%3A4-11?translation=kjv" class="verse-link" data-reference="Acts 2:4-11" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Acts 2:4-11</a>; <a href="https://bible-api.com/Acts%2010%3A44-46?translation=kjv" class="verse-link" data-reference="Acts 10:44-46" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">10:44-46</a>; <a href="https://bible-api.com/Acts%2019%3A4-6?translation=kjv" class="verse-link" data-reference="Acts 19:4-6" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">19:4-6</a>), and the Greek word for “tongues” in each of these three instances is the same word used for “tongues” in <a href="https://bible-api.com/Revelation%2014%3A6?translation=kjv" class="verse-link" data-reference="Revelation 14:6" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Revelation 14:6</a>, which means real languages.</p><p>In 1 Corinthians Paul sheds more light on the subject. He emphasizes that tongues should be spoken that can be understood by those present, and if an unknown tongue is spoken, an interpreter should be used. He then concludes his remarks by making it clear that God is not the author of confusion. So speaking in tongues is a gift of the Spirit that gives a person the ability to speak another language, when that need is present, for the proclamation of the gospel.</p></section>

<p>And <em>grieve not the Holy Spirit of God</em>, whereby ye are sealed unto the day of redemption.</p>
</blockquote><figcaption>— Ephesians 4:30</figcaption></figure><p>Because the Holy Spirit is a Person, He can be grieved, and when this happens, He stops striving with us, meaning He stops convicting us of sin and of righteousness, no longer leading us to abandon the things that are offensive to God (sins of commission) or to do what is right in the sight of God, which can turn into sins of omission, if refused. Grieving away the Holy Spirit is a frightful position to be in because once He ceases to invite a person to come to Christ there is no hope of salvation left.</p><p>The Bible compares the Holy Spirit’s revelations of Bible truth with receiving light. As the Holy Spirit guides us into an understanding of Bible truth, and we choose to walk in that revealed light, God will continue giving us more light (<a href="https://bible-api.com/Proverbs%204%3A18-19?translation=kjv" class="verse-link" data-reference="Proverbs 4:18-19" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Proverbs 4:18-19</a>), but a persistent rejection of revealed truth can lead to the extinguishing of light, leaving us in the spiritual darkness of error (<a href="https://bible-api.com/John%2012%3A35?translation=kjv" class="verse-link" data-reference="John 12:35" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">John 12:35</a>). Paul describes this process as quenching the Spirit (<a href="https://bible-api.com/1%20Thessalonians%205%3A19?translation=kjv" class="verse-link" data-reference="1 Thessalonians 5:19" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">1 Thessalonians 5:19</a>), similar to how water quenches fire.</p><p>In fact, Paul later warns that this quenching can lead to a delusion where error is accepted as truth (<a href="https://bible-api.com/2%20Thessalonians%202%3A10-12?translation=kjv" class="verse-link" data-reference="2 Thessalonians 2:10-12" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2 Thessalonians 2:10-12</a>), which leads to the experience described in <a href="https://bible-api.com/Matthew%207%3A22-23?translation=kjv" class="verse-link" data-reference="Matthew 7:22-23" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Matthew 7:22-23</a> where Jesus says “I never knew you” to those who thought they were saved but, actually, were lost because they had quenched the Spirit.</p><p>In <a href="https://bible-api.com/Matthew%207%3A21?translation=kjv" class="verse-link" data-reference="Matthew 7:21" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Matthew 7:21</a> Jesus says only those who do the will of His Father will enter the kingdom of heaven, so any teaching of “salvation in sin“ is not from God because it rejects the need of Jesus (as does “salvation by works“). A genuine acceptance of Jesus as Lord and Savior, that is motivated by love and gratitute, always leads to a changed lifestyle that is in harmony with His will, which is salvation <em>from</em> sin by faith in Jesus’ power to forgive, save, and transform (<a href="https://bible-api.com/2%20Corinthians%205%3A17?translation=kjv" class="verse-link" data-reference="2 Corinthians 5:17" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2 Corinthians 5:17</a>; <a href="https://bible-api.com/John%2014%3A15?translation=kjv" class="verse-link" data-reference="John 14:15" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">John 14:15</a>).

<p>Wherefore I say unto you, All manner of sin and blasphemy shall be forgiven unto men: but the <em>blasphemy against the Holy Ghost shall not be forgiven unto men</em>. And whosoever speaketh a word against the Son of man, it shall be forgiven him: but whosoever speaketh against the Holy Ghost, it shall not be forgiven him, neither in this world, neither in the world to come.</p>
</blockquote><figcaption>— Matthew 12:31-32</figcaption></figure><p>We’ve learned that one of the roles of the Holy Spirit is to convict us of sin, and the Bible makes it clear that any sin that is confessed will be forgiven by Jesus (<a href="https://bible-api.com/1%20John%201%3A9?translation=kjv" class="verse-link" data-reference="1 John 1:9" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">1 John 1:9</a>). Blasphemy against the Holy Spirit, which cannot be forgiven, also known as the unpardonable sin, is a continual resisting or rejection of the Holy Spirit’s convicting, converting power, which leads to sins that are left unconfessed and, therefore, cannot be forgiven. This is why David, after committing the sin of adultery and murder, prayed that God would not take His Holy Spirit from him (<a href="https://bible-api.com/Psalm%2051%3A11?translation=kjv" class="verse-link" data-reference="Psalm 51:11" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Psalm 51:11</a>) because he knew that only the Spirit was able to lead him to repentance and a transformation of heart.</p><p>God is patient, continuing to plead even with resistant people, but He won’t force Himself on anyone, and there will come a time when His pleading will cease (<a href="https://bible-api.com/Genesis%206%3A3?translation=kjv" class="verse-link" data-reference="Genesis 6:3" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Genesis 6:3</a>), if continually resisted. Each refusal to surrender to the Holy Spirit’s convictions creates a more hardened heart that is less sensitive to future conviction, and if this is continued, the Spirit will eventually depart, leaving that person to live with the cherished, uncofessed sin for good.</p><p>It’s unknown how long it takes to reach the point of no return, but one thing is certain: it’s never safe to say “no” to the Holy Spirit. The only wise thing to do is to surrender to the convictions of the Spirit by confessing and forsaking the sin being pointed out (<a href="https://bible-api.com/1%20John%201%3A9?translation=kjv" class="verse-link" data-reference="1 John 1:9" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">1 John 1:9</a>). By the way, if you feel concerned you have rejected the Holy Spirit then that is evidence you have not.</p></section>
