<p>O thou that <em>hearest prayer</em>, unto thee shall all flesh come.</p>
</blockquote><figcaption>— Psalm 65:2</figcaption></figure>

<p>Jesus made it clear that our heavenly Father wants us to come to Him in prayer. He is more willing to grant our requests than parents are to give good gifts to their children. Of course, He doesn’t grant every request, but only those that will result in “good things” (<a href="https://bible-api.com/Matthew%207%3A11?translation=kjv" class="verse-link" data-reference="Matthew 7:11" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Matthew 7:11</a>)—that is, those in harmony with His wise and loving will for us.</p>

<p>And he arose, and came to his father. But when he was yet a great way off, his father saw him, and had compassion, and ran, and fell on his neck, and kissed him. And the son said unto him, <em>Father, I have sinned against heaven, and in thy sight, and am no more worthy to be called thy son</em>.</p>
</blockquote><figcaption>— Luke 15:20-21</figcaption></figure>

<figure><blockquote>
<p>Two men went up into the temple to pray; the one a Pharisee, and the other a publican. The Pharisee stood and prayed thus with himself, <em>God, I thank thee, that I am not as other men are</em>, extortioners, unjust, adulterers, or even as this publican. <em>I fast twice in the week, I give tithes of all that I possess</em>. And the publican, standing afar off, would not lift up so much as his eyes unto heaven, but smote upon his breast, saying, <em>God be merciful to me a sinner</em>. I tell you, this man went down to his house justified rather than the other: for every one that exalteth himself shall be abased; and he that humbleth himself shall be exalted.</p>
</blockquote><figcaption>— Luke 18:10-14</figcaption></figure>

<figure><blockquote>
<p>And Jesus answering said unto them, They that are whole need not a physician; but they that are sick. <em>I came not to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance</em>.</p>
</blockquote><figcaption>— Luke 5:31-32</figcaption></figure>

<p>Being aware of our true relationship to God leads to prayers rooted in humility and reverence for Him—a consciousness of His holiness and wisdom, as well as our own unworthiness. It is only through the blood of Christ, shed for our sins, that we have been reconciled to our heavenly Father and enabled to come to Him in prayer. The Pharisee felt self-sufficient and therefore saw no need of Jesus, but the publican and the prodigal son were keenly aware of their unworthiness. Jesus made it clear that those who believe <em>they</em> are righteous feel little need of <em>His</em> righteousness, but those who recognize they are sinners are the ones He came to make whole (<a href="https://bible-api.com/Luke%208%3A48?translation=kjv" class="verse-link" data-reference="Luke 8:48" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Luke 8:48</a>).</p>

<p><em>We have sinned, and have committed iniquity, and have done wickedly, and have rebelled</em>, even by departing from thy precepts and from thy judgments.</p>
</blockquote><figcaption>— Daniel 9:5</figcaption></figure>

<figure><blockquote>
<p>O Lord, <em>righteousness belongeth unto thee, but unto us confusion of faces</em>, as at this day; to the men of Judah, and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and unto all Israel, that are near, and that are far off, through all the countries whither thou hast driven them, because of their trespass that they have trespassed against thee.</p>
</blockquote><figcaption>— Daniel 9:7</figcaption></figure>

<figure><blockquote>
<p>O my God, incline thine ear, and hear; open thine eyes, and behold our desolations, and the city which is called by thy name: for <em>we do not present our supplications before thee for our righteousnesses</em>, but for thy great mercies.</p>
</blockquote><figcaption>— Daniel 9:18</figcaption></figure>

<figure><blockquote>
<p>This is a faithful saying, and worthy of all acceptation, that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners; <em>of whom I am chief</em>.</p>
</blockquote><figcaption>— 1 Timothy 1:15</figcaption></figure>

<p>Daniel, after a lifetime of following God, included himself in the sins of his people when praying for God’s forgiveness. He did not say, “They have sinned,” but, “We have sinned.” Likewise, Paul, after many fruitful years of preaching, teaching, and building up the early church, did not hesitate to call himself the chief of sinners. He could have said, “Of whom I <em>was</em> chief,” but he said, “Of whom I <em>am</em> chief.”</p>
<p>Today, there is so much emphasis on our identity as sons and daughters of God that calling oneself a sinner is almost viewed as heresy or a perversion of the gospel, but Paul and Daniel would beg to differ. It is true that <em>in</em> Christ we are children of God, but let us not forget who we are <em>apart</em> from Christ, so we never lose sight of our need to continually cling to Him (<a href="https://bible-api.com/1%20Corinthians%2010%3A12?translation=kjv" class="verse-link" data-reference="1 Corinthians 10:12" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">1 Corinthians 10:12</a>); otherwise, we risk adopting the Pharisaic mindset—that being God’s children we no longer have a need of repentance (<a href="https://bible-api.com/1%20John%205%3A8?translation=kjv" class="verse-link" data-reference="1 John 5:8" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">1 John 5:8</a>).</p>

<p>And he went a little further, and fell on his face, and prayed, saying, O my Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me: nevertheless <em>not as I will, but as thou wilt</em>.</p>

<figure><blockquote>

<p>If I regard <em>iniquity</em> in my heart, the <em>Lord will not hear me</em>.</p>

<p>It’s crucial to be fully surrendered to His will for our prayers to be effective. If there is anything in our lives that is out of harmony with His will—any sin He has convicted us about—it’s crucial that we humble ourselves, repent, and forsake it. If the desire to do this is lacking, we can ask Him to give it to us (<a href="https://bible-api.com/Acts%205%3A31?translation=kjv" class="verse-link" data-reference="Acts 5:31" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Acts 5:31</a>; <a href="https://bible-api.com/Philippians%202%3A13?translation=kjv" class="verse-link" data-reference="Philippians 2:13" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Philippians 2:13</a>). The unconverted human heart is naturally drawn to sin, so it is God alone who can give us a hatred for it (<a href="https://bible-api.com/Genesis%203%3A15?translation=kjv" class="verse-link" data-reference="Genesis 3:15" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Genesis 3:15</a>). Willful rebellion is so serious that, according to <a href="https://bible-api.com/Proverbs%2028%3A9?translation=kjv" class="verse-link" data-reference="Proverbs 28:9" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Proverbs 28:9</a>, it makes one’s prayer an abomination to God. Paul echoes this sentiment when he says that God will not be mocked (<a href="https://bible-api.com/Galatians%206%3A7?translation=kjv" class="verse-link" data-reference="Galatians 6:7" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Galatians 6:7</a>), for He sees our hearts and knows when we are harboring willful hypocrisy or pretense toward Him.</p>
<p>God will never force His will upon us, which is why surrender begins with the <em>willingness</em> to follow His will. It’s a choice we consciously make, giving Him permission to activate His will and power in our lives.</p>

<p>But <em>seek ye first the kingdom of God, and his righteousness</em>; and all these things shall be added unto you.</p>
</blockquote><figcaption>— Matthew 6:33</figcaption></figure>

<figure><blockquote>
<p>After this manner therefore pray ye: Our Father which art in heaven, <em>Hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done</em> in earth, as it is in heaven.</p>
</blockquote><figcaption>— Matthew 6:9-10</figcaption></figure>

<p>It is easy for our prayers to become self-focused and selfish, but Christ teaches us to seek first His kingdom and His righteousness. This is later reinforced in His model prayer: “Hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done.” Below are some difficult—but necessary—questions we can ask to help us understand where we stand:</p>
<ol>
<li>Is my primary focus on bringing glory and honor to His holy name rather than my own?</li>
<li>Am I preparing for and investing in His kingdom of righteousness—which, by the way, starts in our hearts now (<a href="https://bible-api.com/Luke%2017%3A20-21?translation=kjv" class="verse-link" data-reference="Luke 17:20-21" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Luke 17:20-21</a>)—or am I more concerned with expanding my own personal, earthly empire?</li>
<li>Am I seeking His will in my daily life, or am I pursuing my own wants and desires above all else?</li>
</ol>
<p>One author shared the following insight on praying Jesus’ model prayer:</p>
<figure><blockquote>
<p>I cannot say ‘our’ if I live only for myself. I cannot say ‘Father’ if I do not endeavor each day to act like his child. I cannot say ‘who art in heaven’ if I’m laying up no treasures there. I cannot say ‘hallowed be thy name’ if I am not striving for holiness. I cannot say ‘thy kingdom come’ if I’m not seeking to hasten the blessed hope. I cannot say ‘thy will be done’ if I am disobedient to his word. I cannot say ‘in earth as it is in heaven’ if I’ll not serve him here and now. I cannot say ‘give us this day our daily bread’ if I am selfishly hoarding for the fu-ture. I cannot say ‘forgive us our debts’ if I harbor a grudge against anyone. I cannot say ‘lead us not into temptation’ if I deliberately place myself in its path. I cannot say ‘deliver us from evil’ if I do not long for holiness. I cannot say ‘thine is the kingdom’ if I do not give Jesus the throne of my heart. I cannot attribute to him ‘the power’ if I fear what men may do. I cannot ascribe to him ‘the glory’ if I’m seeking for my own honor. I cannot say ‘forever’ if I’m living only for temporary earthly rewards.</p>

<p>Besides praying for His glory, His kingdom, and His will, God also cares about our personal lives and invites us to bring to Him anything that causes worry, trouble, or heaviness in our hearts. He is our loving heavenly Father who is deeply interested in the burdens we carry, and He wants to help!</p>

<p>Praying always with all prayer and supplication in the Spirit, and watching thereunto <em>with all perseverance and supplication for all saints</em>.</p>
</blockquote><figcaption>— Ephesians 6:18</figcaption></figure>

<figure><blockquote>
<p>I exhort therefore, that, first of all, <em>supplications, prayers, intercessions, and giving of thanks, be made for all men</em>; for kings, and for all that are in authority; that we may lead a quiet and peaceable life in all godliness and honesty. For this is good and acceptable in the sight of God our Saviour.</p>
</blockquote><figcaption>— 1 Timothy 2:1-3</figcaption></figure>

<figure><blockquote>
<p>And the Lord said, Simon, Simon, behold, Satan hath desired to have you, that he may sift you as wheat: but <em>I have prayed for thee, that thy faith fail not</em>: and when thou art converted, strengthen thy brethren.</p>
</blockquote><figcaption>— Luke 22:31,32</figcaption></figure>

<p>Praying for others is another crucial part of our prayer life. When we pray for someone else, God receives the legal right to work in that person’s life—a right He might not otherwise have if we had not prayed. Why is this? Since God values each person’s freedom of choice, He does not work against someone’s will, especially if that person is resistant to Him, but when another person begins interceding, it changes everything. It opens the door for God to work in the resistant person’s life out of respect for the intercessor’s prayer.</p>
<p>Intercessory prayer, however, is not limited to those who are resistant to God. Jesus prayed for Peter—one of His own disciples—because He saw a blind spot in Peter’s life that Peter was unaware of. Moses prayed for the Israelites (<a href="https://bible-api.com/Numbers%2021%3A7?translation=kjv" class="verse-link" data-reference="Numbers 21:7" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Numbers 21:7</a>) and for his brother Aaron (<a href="https://bible-api.com/Deuteronomy%209%3A20?translation=kjv" class="verse-link" data-reference="Deuteronomy 9:20" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Deuteronomy 9:20</a>), and Job prayed for his friends (<a href="https://bible-api.com/Job%2042%3A10?translation=kjv" class="verse-link" data-reference="Job 42:10" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Job 42:10</a>). Just as Jesus intercedes for us in the heavenly sanctuary (<a href="https://bible-api.com/Hebrews%207%3A25?translation=kjv" class="verse-link" data-reference="Hebrews 7:25" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hebrews 7:25</a>), we, as His followers, are called to intercede for others.</p>

</blockquote><figcaption>— 1 Timothy 5:5-6</figcaption></figure>

<p>Praying for others often involves asking God for a change of heart, and this usually takes time. God honors everyone’s free will, but He also honors the prayers of others, so even if a person resists Him initially, there is still hope, as long as those praying are willing to persevere and be patient. It may take years—or even decades—for a change of heart to take place, but that is nothing compared with eternity.</p>
<p>All good things take time and effort, and prayer is no different. Rushed prayers often lack power because they don’t mean much to us, but prayers that produce results take time and effort. It would be wise for us to preface every important decision or action in our lives with much prayer. Jesus Himself sometimes prayed all night, such as before ordaining the twelve apostles (<a href="https://bible-api.com/Luke%206%3A12-13?translation=kjv" class="verse-link" data-reference="Luke 6:12-13" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Luke 6:12-13</a>). As our prayer life develops, spending time communing with our Father becomes a delight, no matter how long it takes.</p>

</blockquote><figcaption>— Matthew 7:7-8</figcaption></figure>

<p>This might seem obvious, but simply bringing our request to God—asking Him to be involved in resolving it—is the first step toward effective prayer. God is a Gentleman (<a href="https://bible-api.com/Revelation%203%3A20?translation=kjv" class="verse-link" data-reference="Revelation 3:20" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Revelation 3:20</a>); He will not involve Himself where He is not desired or welcomed. He respects our free will too much to force His way into our lives without our permission. By the way, the best things to ask for are those that are in harmony with His will as revealed in His Word. If we can find a verse in the Bible showing that our request aligns with His will, we can have confidence that we are on the right track.</p>

<p>And Jesus answering saith unto them, <em>Have faith in God</em>. For verily I say unto you, That whosoever shall say unto this mountain, Be thou removed, and be thou cast into the sea; and <em>shall not doubt in his heart, but shall believe</em> that those things which he saith shall come to pass; he shall have whatsoever he saith. Therefore I say unto you, What things soever ye desire, when ye pray, <em>believe that ye receive them, and ye shall have them</em>.</p>
</blockquote><figcaption>— Mark 11:22-24</figcaption></figure>

<p>Faith is the hand that reaches out to God, taking Him at His word. One of the many ways God is different from us is that His word has creative power to accomplish what He pleases (<a href="https://bible-api.com/Isaiah%2055%3A11?translation=kjv" class="verse-link" data-reference="Isaiah 55:11" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Isaiah 55:11</a>). When we speak, our words have no power to create something out of nothing, but when God speaks, things happen (<a href="https://bible-api.com/Genesis%201%3A3?translation=kjv" class="verse-link" data-reference="Genesis 1:3" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Genesis 1:3</a>); if He has promised something, we can count on Him to keep that promise (<a href="https://bible-api.com/Numbers%2023%3A19?translation=kjv" class="verse-link" data-reference="Numbers 23:19" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Numbers 23:19</a>)—and there is a promise in the Bible for all of our needs.</p>
<p>But what if our faith is weak? The Bible tells us that:</p>
<ol>
<li>God has given every person a measure of faith (<a href="https://bible-api.com/Romans%2012%3A3?translation=kjv" class="verse-link" data-reference="Romans 12:3" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Romans 12:3</a>).</li>
<li>We can ask Him to increase our faith (<a href="https://bible-api.com/Mark%209%3A24?translation=kjv" class="verse-link" data-reference="Mark 9:24" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mark 9:24</a>), and He will likely give us opportunities to exercise it.</li>
<li>Faith comes by hearing, and hearing by the Word of God (<a href="https://bible-api.com/Romans%2010%3A17?translation=kjv" class="verse-link" data-reference="Romans 10:17" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Romans 10:17</a>). In other words, we grow in faith as we get to know Him more through the study of His Word and through prayer.</li>
</ol>
<p>So why is faith so important to God? Well, it’s the foundation of our relationship with Him. There is nothing more pleasing to a father than a child coming to him in confidence, full of trust in his love and power. Our heavenly Father delights when we come to Him in prayer, trusting that He will hear and answer our requests in His time and way. (For a more detailed study on faith, see <a href="/gospel/faith/">“Walking in Faith”</a>.)</p>

<p>Then they took away the stone from the place where the dead was laid. And Jesus lifted up his eyes, and said, Father, <em>I thank thee that thou hast heard me</em>. And I knew that thou hearest me always: but because of the people which stand by I said it, that they may believe that thou hast sent me. And when he thus had spoken, he cried with a loud voice, Lazarus, come forth. And he that was dead came forth...</p>
</blockquote><figcaption>— John 11:41-44</figcaption></figure>

<figure><blockquote>
<p>And when he had consulted with the people, he appointed singers unto the LORD, and that should praise the beauty of holiness, as they went out before the army, and to say, Praise the LORD; for his mercy endureth for ever. And <em>when they began to sing and to praise</em>, the LORD set ambushments against the children of Ammon, Moab, and mount Seir, which were come against Judah; and <em>they were smitten</em>.</p>
</blockquote><figcaption>— 2 Chronicles 20:21-22</figcaption></figure>

<p>When Jesus raised Lazarus, He thanked God for hearing His prayer <em>before</em> the resurrection occurred. Likewise, when the Israelites went to war under Jehoshaphat, they praised God <em>before</em> the battle even began. Thanking God before we receive His answer is closely related to the concept we just discussed—faith; it is further evidence of a trusting confidence in His love. It is natural to give thanks for something already received, but giving thanks in advance requires faith. However, if we know our request is in harmony with His will, as revealed in the Bible, we can be confident that He will answer it. Knowing God’s will for us will requires Bible study, but there is power in finding a promise in His Word that pertains to our request, presenting it to Him in prayer, and then claiming it—in the name of His beloved Son—by faith, and thanking Him for it. In Jesus, all of God’s promises are sure (<a href="https://bible-api.com/2%20Corinthians%201%3A20?translation=kjv" class="verse-link" data-reference="2 Corinthians 1:20" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2 Corinthians 1:20</a>).</p>
<p>Obviously, how and when God answers our prayers is up to Him. He may say “Yes,” or He may say “Wait” if the timing is not quite right, thereby giving us a chance to practice patience. “No” is a perfectly legitimate answer too, even though it may not be what we wanted. In such cases, we can rest in the assurance that He sees the end from the beginning and always has our best interests in mind—knowing what is best for us better than we do ourselves.</p>
<p>The three parts of an effective prayer can be easily remembered with the ABC acronym: Ask (A), Believe (B), and Claim (C). Author Glen Coon expounds on these in greater detail in his book <em>The ABCs of Bible Prayer</em>.</p>

<p>In Adam and Eve’s rejection of God in the garden, the human race separated itself from its Maker, but God immediately promised that, in His Son Jesus, He would provide them, and anyone who desired it, a path to reconciliation (<a href="https://bible-api.com/Genesis%203%3A15?translation=kjv" class="verse-link" data-reference="Genesis 3:15" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Genesis 3:15</a>). This promise was later illustrated to Jacob in the dream of a ladder, symbolizing Jesus, that united heaven and earth (<a href="https://bible-api.com/Genesis%2028%3A12?translation=kjv" class="verse-link" data-reference="Genesis 28:12" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Genesis 28:12</a>).</p>
<p>Adam and Eve’s rejection is replayed in the life of every person, for all have sinned (<a href="https://bible-api.com/Romans%203%3A23?translation=kjv" class="verse-link" data-reference="Romans 3:23" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Romans 3:23</a>). Apart from Christ—who alone lived a perfect life and offered it on the cross to pay for our sins—we have nothing to commend us to God. Our sins have made us unworthy of our Father (<a href="https://bible-api.com/Luke%2015%3A21?translation=kjv" class="verse-link" data-reference="Luke 15:21" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Luke 15:21</a>), but Jesus has given us a second chance! When we pray in His name, we are enabled to “come boldly unto the throne of grace, that we may obtain mercy, and find grace to help in time of need” (<a href="https://bible-api.com/Hebrews%204%3A16?translation=kjv" class="verse-link" data-reference="Hebrews 4:16" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hebrews 4:16</a>) because, when we accept Him as our Redeemer and Lord, He covers the shame of our sins with His perfect righteousness (<a href="https://bible-api.com/Isaiah%2061%3A10?translation=kjv" class="verse-link" data-reference="Isaiah 61:10" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Isaiah 61:10</a>), and God calls us His children once more (<a href="https://bible-api.com/1%20John%203%3A1?translation=kjv" class="verse-link" data-reference="1 John 3:1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">1 John 3:1</a>)!

There will be circumstances in which these may be harder to express, but Paul tells us that “all things work together for good to those who love God” (<a href="https://bible-api.com/Romans%208%3A28?translation=kjv" class="verse-link" data-reference="Romans 8:28" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Romans 8:28</a>). Note that he doesn’t say “some things” or “most things,” but “all.” This means that God will use even the greatest tragedy for good—just look at the cross, where Jesus hung, rejected and crucified by the very people He came to save. Nothing we will ever experience comes close to what He endured on the cross. He took the sword first and blunted its edge for us.</p>

<p>Prayer leads us into harmony with the mind of Jesus and into deeper fellowship with Him. It is said that we are the sum of the people we spend the most time with because we often begin to imitate them. Prayer, along with Bible study, is how we spend time with Jesus. Bible study is how He speaks to us, and prayer is how we speak to Him. Without daily, quality time, every relationship will eventually fall apart—including our relationship with Christ.</p>

<p>When we are tempted, the last thing we often want to do is pray, but connecting with God in that crucial moment is key, and it’s best to continue praying until the temptation passes. As long as we hold on to God, we cannot be overcome. Praying <em>before</em> the temptation comes, as demonstrated in Jesus’ model prayer, is also wise: “and lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil” (<a href="https://bible-api.com/Matthew%206%3A13?translation=kjv" class="verse-link" data-reference="Matthew 6:13" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Matthew 6:13</a>). If we are willing to be vigilant and avoid situations we know will tempt us, God will do His part to help us. The good news is there is a way of escape from every temptation, as God will never allow us to be tempted beyond what we are able to bear (<a href="https://bible-api.com/1%20Corinthians%2010%3A13?translation=kjv" class="verse-link" data-reference="1 Corinthians 10:13" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">1 Corinthians 10:13</a>).</p>
<p>Had Jesus’ disciples heeded His call to watch and pray in Gethsemane, there is no doubt they would have been strengthened to better endure what was about to come upon both Him and them. And poor Peter—would he have denied his Lord if he had spent that time in prayer instead of sleeping?</p>

<p>When God provided manna for the Israelites, it didn’t simply fall into their mouths; they still had to go out and gather it. God wants us to cooperate with Him by investing ourselves in the process; otherwise, we risk becoming lazy with His blessings. The simple truth is that He will never do for us what we can do for ourselves, but once we have done our part, He will do what we cannot.</p>

<p>Jesus associated the repetition of words and phrases with paganism (<a href="https://bible-api.com/Acts%2019%3A34?translation=kjv" class="verse-link" data-reference="Acts 19:34" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Acts 19:34</a>; <a href="https://bible-api.com/1%20Kings%2018%3A26?translation=kjv" class="verse-link" data-reference="1 Kings 18:26" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">1 Kings 18:26</a>), thereby making it clear that such practices have no place in the life of a Christian. The same is true of “breath prayers” and the popular practice of “entering the silence,” which often involves emptying the mind—disengaging the reasoning faculties—which is one of the quickest ways to enter an altered state of consciousness. Such practices often lead to mysticism and can open the door to the influence of malevolent spiritual powers. (For more information, see Howard Peth’s book <em>The Dangers of Contemplative Prayer</em>.)</p>
<p>God desires that we be fully engaged when we speak with Him—just as we would be when talking to a close friend—with our minds alert and our reasoning intact (<a href="https://bible-api.com/Isaiah%201%3A18?translation=kjv" class="verse-link" data-reference="Isaiah 1:18" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Isaiah 1:18</a>). Prayer should be fresh, fervent, and from the heart. If our hearts are not in it, we probably should not be praying it. Prayers that do not mean much to us are unlikely to mean much to God.</p>
