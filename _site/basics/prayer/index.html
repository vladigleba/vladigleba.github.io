</blockquote><figcaption>— Mark 14:32</figcaption></figure>

<p>The Bible tells us that Jesus, our example, was a man of prayer. If He had a need to pray, how much more do we?</p>

<figure><blockquote>
<p>O thou that <em>hearest prayer</em>, unto thee shall all flesh come.</p>
</blockquote><figcaption>— Psalm 65:2</figcaption></figure>

<p>Jesus made it clear that our heavenly Father wants us to come to Him in prayer. He is more willing to grant our requests than parents are willing to give good gifts to their children. Of course, He doesn't grant every request, but only those that will result in "good things" (<a href="https://bible-api.com/Matthew%207%3A11?translation=kjv" class="verse-link" data-reference="Matthew 7:11" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Matthew 7:11</a>)—that is, those in harmony with His wise and loving will for us.</p>

<figure><blockquote>
<p>And he arose, and came to his father. But when he was yet a great way off, his father saw him, and had compassion, and ran, and fell on his neck, and kissed him. And the son said unto him, <em>Father, I have sinned against heaven, and in thy sight, and am no more worthy to be called thy son</em>.</p>
</blockquote><figcaption>— Luke 15:20, 21</figcaption></figure>

<figure><blockquote>
<p>Two men went up into the temple to pray; the one a Pharisee, and the other a publican. The Pharisee stood and prayed thus with himself, <em>God, I thank thee, that I am not as other men are</em>, extortioners, unjust, adulterers, or even as this publican. <em>I fast twice in the week, I give tithes of all that I possess</em>. And the publican, standing afar off, would not lift up so much as his eyes unto heaven, but smote upon his breast, saying, <em>God be merciful to me a sinner</em>. I tell you, this man went down to his house justified rather than the other: for every one that exalteth himself shall be abased; and he that humbleth himself shall be exalted.</p>
</blockquote><figcaption>— Luke 18:10-14</figcaption></figure>

<figure><blockquote>
<p>And Jesus answering said unto them, They that are whole need not a physician; but they that are sick. <em>I came not to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance</em>.</p>
</blockquote><figcaption>— Luke 5:31, 32</figcaption></figure>

<p>Being conscious of our true relation to God will lead to prayers that are marked by humility and reverence for Him, including an awareness of His holiness and wisdom, as well as our own unworthiness. It is only through the blood of Christ, shed for our sins, that we have been reconciled to our heavenly Father and enabled to come to Him in prayer. The Pharisee felt self-sufficient, and therefore saw no need for Jesus, but the publican and the prodigal son were keenly aware of their unworthiness. Jesus made it clear that those who believe they are righteous feel no need for Him, but those who recognize they are sinners are the ones He came to make whole.</p>

<p><em>We have sinned, and have committed iniquity, and have done wickedly, and have rebelled</em>, even by departing from thy precepts and from thy judgments.</p>
</blockquote><figcaption>— Daniel 9:5</figcaption></figure>

<figure><blockquote>
<p>O Lord, <em>righteousness belongeth unto thee, but unto us confusion of faces</em>, as at this day; to the men of Judah, and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and unto all Israel, that are near, and that are far off, through all the countries whither thou hast driven them, because of their trespass that they have trespassed against thee.</p>
</blockquote><figcaption>— Daniel 9:7</figcaption></figure>

<figure><blockquote>
<p>O my God, incline thine ear, and hear; open thine eyes, and behold our desolations, and the city which is called by thy name: for <em>we do not present our supplications before thee for our righteousnesses</em>, but for thy great mercies.</p>
</blockquote><figcaption>— Daniel 9:18</figcaption></figure>

<figure><blockquote>
<p>This is a faithful saying, and worthy of all acceptation, that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners; <em>of whom I am chief</em>.</p>
</blockquote><figcaption>— 1 Timothy 1:15</figcaption></figure>

<p>Daniel, after a lifetime of following God, included himself in the sins of his people when praying for God's forgiveness. He did not say, "They have sinned," but, "We have sinned." Likewise, Paul, after spending years of his life preaching, teaching, and building up the early church, did not hesitate to refer to himself as the chief of sinners. He could have said, "Of whom I <em>was</em> chief," but he said, "Of whom I <em>am</em> chief."</p>
<p>Today, there is so much emphasis on our identity as sons and daughters of God that calling oneself a sinner is viewed almost as heresy or a perversion of the gospel, but Paul and Daniel would beg to differ. It's true that <em>in</em> Christ we are children of God, but let's not forget who we are <em>apart</em> from Christ so that we can continue to see the need to cling to Him (<a href="https://bible-api.com/1%20Corinthians%2010%3A12?translation=kjv" class="verse-link" data-reference="1 Corinthians 10:12" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">1 Corinthians 10:12</a>).</p>

<figure><blockquote>
<p>And he went a little further, and fell on his face, and prayed, saying, O my Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me: nevertheless <em>not as I will, but as thou wilt</em>.</p>

<figure><blockquote>
<p>And whatsoever we ask, we receive of him, because we <em>keep his commandments</em>, and <em>do those things that are pleasing in his sight</em>.</p>

<figure><blockquote>
<p>If I regard <em>iniquity</em> in my heart, the <em>Lord will not hear me</em>.</p>
</blockquote><figcaption>— Psalm 66:18</figcaption></figure>

<p>It's crucial to be fully surrendered to His will for our prayers to be effective. If there is anything in our life that is out of harmony with His will—any sin that He has convicted us about—it's crucial that we humble ourselves, repent, and forsake it. If the desire to do this is not there, we can ask Him to give it to us (<a href="https://bible-api.com/Acts%205%3A31?translation=kjv" class="verse-link" data-reference="Acts 5:31" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Acts 5:31</a>; <a href="https://bible-api.com/Philippains%202%3A13?translation=kjv" class="verse-link" data-reference="Philippains 2:13" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Philippains 2:13</a>). The unconverted human heart is naturally drawn to sin, so it's God alone who can give us a hatred for it (<a href="https://bible-api.com/Genesis%203%3A15?translation=kjv" class="verse-link" data-reference="Genesis 3:15" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Genesis 3:15</a>). Willful rebellion in the life is so serious that, according to <a href="https://bible-api.com/Proverbs%2028%3A9?translation=kjv" class="verse-link" data-reference="Proverbs 28:9" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Proverbs 28:9</a>, it makes one's prayer an abomination to God. Paul echoes this sentinment when he says that God will not be mocked (<a href="https://bible-api.com/Galatians%206%3A7?translation=kjv" class="verse-link" data-reference="Galatians 6:7" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Galatians 6:7</a>) as He sees our hearts and knows when we are harboring willful hypocrisy or pretense toward Him.</p>
<p>God will never force His will upon us, which is why surrender starts with the <em>willingness</em> to follow His will. It's a choice we consciously make, giving Him permission to activate His will and power in our lives.</p>

<p>But <em>seek ye first the kingdom of God, and his righteousness</em>; and all these things shall be added unto you.</p>
</blockquote><figcaption>— Matthew 6:33</figcaption></figure>

<figure><blockquote>
<p>After this manner therefore pray ye: Our Father which art in heaven, <em>Hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done</em> in earth, as it is in heaven.</p>
</blockquote><figcaption>— Matthew 6:9, 10</figcaption></figure>

<p>It's easy for our prayers to become self-focused and selfish, but Christ teaches us to seek first His kingdom and His righteousness. This is later reinforced in His model prayer: "Hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done." Below are some difficult—but necessary—questions we can ask to help us understand where we stand:</p>
<ol>
<li>Is my primary focus on bringing glory and honor to His holy name rather than my own?</li>
<li>Am I preparing for and investing in His kingdom of righteousness—which, by the way, starts in our hearts now (<a href="https://bible-api.com/Luke%2017%3A20%2C%2021?translation=kjv" class="verse-link" data-reference="Luke 17:20, 21" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Luke 17:20, 21</a>)—or am I more concerned with expanding my own personal, earthly empire?</li>
<li>Am I seeking His will in my daily life, or am I pursuing my own wants and desires above all else?</li>
</ol>
<p>One author shared the following insight on praying Jesus' model prayer:</p>
<figure><blockquote>
<p>I cannot say ‘our’ if I live only for myself. I cannot say ‘Father’ if I do not endeavor each day to act like his child. I cannot say ‘who art in heaven’ if I’m laying up no treasures there. I cannot say ‘hallowed be thy name’ if I am not striving for holiness. I cannot say ‘thy kingdom come’ if I’m not seeking to hasten the blessed hope. I cannot say ‘thy will be done’ if I am disobedient to his word. I cannot say ‘in earth as it is in heaven’ if I’ll not serve him here and now. I cannot say ‘give us this day our daily bread’ if I am selfishly hoarding for the fu-ture. I cannot say ‘forgive us our debts’ if I harbor a grudge against anyone. I cannot say ‘lead us not into temptation’ if I deliberately place myself in its path. I cannot say ‘deliver us from evil’ if I do not long for holiness. I cannot say ‘thine is the kingdom’ if I do not give Jesus the throne of my heart. I cannot attribute to him ‘the power’ if I fear what men may do. I cannot ascribe to him ‘the glory’ if I’m seeking for my own honor. I cannot say ‘forever’ if I’m living only for temporary earthly rewards.</p>

<p>Besides praying for His glory, His kingdom, and His will, God also cares about our personal lives and invites us to bring to Him anything that brings worry, trouble, or heaviness into our hearts. He is our loving, heavenly Father who is deeply interested in the burdens we are carrying, and He wants to help!</p>

<p>Praying always with all prayer and supplication in the Spirit, and watching thereunto <em>with all perseverance and supplication for all saints</em>.</p>
</blockquote><figcaption>— Ephesians 6:18</figcaption></figure>

<figure><blockquote>
<p>I exhort therefore, that, first of all, <em>supplications, prayers, intercessions, and giving of thanks, be made for all men</em>; for kings, and for all that are in authority; that we may lead a quiet and peaceable life in all godliness and honesty. For this is good and acceptable in the sight of God our Saviour.</p>
</blockquote><figcaption>— 1 Timothy 2:1-3</figcaption></figure>

<figure><blockquote>
<p>And the Lord said, Simon, Simon, behold, Satan hath desired to have you, that he may sift you as wheat: but <em>I have prayed for thee, that thy faith fail not</em>: and when thou art converted, strengthen thy brethren.</p>
</blockquote><figcaption>— Luke 22:31,32</figcaption></figure>

<p>Praying for others is another crucial part of our prayer life. When we pray for someone else, God receives the legal right to work in that person's life—a right He otherwise would not have if we had not prayed. Why is this? Since God values each person's freedom of choice, He cannot work against someone's will, especially if a person is resistant to Him, but when another person starts interceding, that changes everything. It opens the door for God to work in the resistant person's life out of respect to the intercessor.</p>
<p>Intercessory prayer, however, is not limited just to those resistant to God. Jesus prayed for Peter—one of His own disciples—because He saw a blind spot in Peter's life that Peter was unaware of. Moses prayed for the Israelites (<a href="https://bible-api.com/Numbers%2021%3A7?translation=kjv" class="verse-link" data-reference="Numbers 21:7" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Numbers 21:7</a>) and for his brother Aaron (<a href="https://bible-api.com/Deuteronomy%209%3A20?translation=kjv" class="verse-link" data-reference="Deuteronomy 9:20" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Deuteronomy 9:20</a>), and Job prayed for his friends (<a href="https://bible-api.com/Job%2042%3A10?translation=kjv" class="verse-link" data-reference="Job 42:10" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Job 42:10</a>). Just like Jesus intercedes for us in the heavenly sanctuary (<a href="https://bible-api.com/Hebrews%207%3A25?translation=kjv" class="verse-link" data-reference="Hebrews 7:25" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hebrews 7:25</a>), as His followers, we are called to intercede for others.</p>

</blockquote><figcaption>— Matthew 7:7, 8</figcaption></figure>

<p>This might seem obvious, but simply bringing our request to God, asking Him to be involved in resolving it is the first part of an effective prayer. God is a Gentleman (<a href="https://bible-api.com/Revelation%203%3A20?translation=kjv" class="verse-link" data-reference="Revelation 3:20" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Revelation 3:20</a>): He will not be involved where He is not desired or welcomed. He respects our free will too much to force His way into our lives without our permission. By the way, the best things to ask for are those that are in harmony with His will as revealed in His Word. If we can find a verse in the Bible showing that our request is in accordance with His will, we can have confidence we are on the right track.</p>

Therefore I say unto you, What things soever ye desire, when ye pray, <em>believe that ye receive them, and ye shall have them</em>.</p>

<p>Faith is the hand that reaches out to God, taking Him at His word. One of the ways, among many, that God is different from us is His word has creative power to accomplish what He pleases (<a href="https://bible-api.com/Isaiah%2055%3A11?translation=kjv" class="verse-link" data-reference="Isaiah 55:11" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Isaiah 55:11</a>). When we speak, our words have no power to create something out of thin air. But when God speaks, things happen (<a href="https://bible-api.com/Genesis%201%3A3?translation=kjv" class="verse-link" data-reference="Genesis 1:3" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Genesis 1:3</a>); if He has promised something, we can count on Him to keep that promise (<a href="https://bible-api.com/Numbers%2023%3A19?translation=kjv" class="verse-link" data-reference="Numbers 23:19" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Numbers 23:19</a>)—and there is a promise in the Bible for all of our needs.</p>
<p>But what if our faith is weak? The Bible tells us that:</p>
<ol>
<li>God has given every person a measure of faith (<a href="https://bible-api.com/Romans%2012%3A3?translation=kjv" class="verse-link" data-reference="Romans 12:3" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Romans 12:3</a>).</li>
<li>We can ask Him to increase our faith (<a href="https://bible-api.com/Mark%209%3A24?translation=kjv" class="verse-link" data-reference="Mark 9:24" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mark 9:24</a>), and He will likely give us opportunities to exercise it.</li>
<li>Faith comes by hearing, and hearing by the Word of God (<a href="https://bible-api.com/Romans%2010%3A17?translation=kjv" class="verse-link" data-reference="Romans 10:17" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Romans 10:17</a>). In other words, we grow in faith as we get to know Him more through the study of His word and prayer.</li>
</ol>
<p>So why is faith so important to God? Well, it's the foundation of our relationship with Him. There is nothing more pleasing to a father than a child coming to him in confidence, full of trust in his love and power. Our heavenly Father delights when we come to Him in prayer, trusting that He will hear and answer our request in His time and way. (For a more detailed study on faith, see <a href="/gospel/faith/">“Walking in Faith”</a>.)</p>

<p>Then they took away the stone from the place where the dead was laid. And Jesus lifted up his eyes, and said, Father, <em>I thank thee that thou hast heard me</em>. And I knew that thou hearest me always: but because of the people which stand by I said it, that they may believe that thou hast sent me. And when he thus had spoken, he cried with a loud voice, Lazarus, come forth. And he that was dead came forth...</p>

<figure><blockquote>
<p>And when he had consulted with the people, he appointed singers unto the LORD, and that should praise the beauty of holiness, as they went out before the army, and to say, Praise the LORD; for his mercy endureth for ever. And <em>when they began to sing and to praise</em>, the LORD set ambushments against the children of Ammon, Moab, and mount Seir, which were come against Judah; and <em>they were smitten</em>.</p>
</blockquote><figcaption>— 2 Chronicles 20:21, 22</figcaption></figure>

<p>When Jesus raised Lazarus, He thanked God for hearing His prayer <em>before</em> the resurrection occured. Likewise, when the Israelites went to war under Jehoshaphat they praised God <em>before</em> the battle even began. Thanking God before we have His answer is closely related with the second concept we just discussed—faith; it is further evidence of a trusting confidence in His love. It is natural to give thanks for something already received, but giving thanks ahead of time takes faith. However, if we know our request is in harmony with His will, as revealed in the Bible, we can be confident that He will answer it. Knowing God's will for us will require some Bible study, but there is power in finding a promise in His Word pertaining to our request, presenting it to Him in prayer, and then claiming it, in the name of His beloved Son, by faith, and thanking Him for it. In Jesus, all of God's promises are sure (<a href="https://bible-api.com/2%20Corinthians%201%3A20?translation=kjv" class="verse-link" data-reference="2 Corinthians 1:20" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2 Corinthians 1:20</a>).</p>
<p>Obviously, how and when God answers our prayer is up to Him; He may say "Yes," or He may say "Wait" if the timing may not be quite right, thereby giving us a chance to practice patience. "No" is a perfectly legitimate answer too, even though it may not be what we wanted. In such a case we can rest knowing that He sees the end from the beginning and always has our best interest in mind, knowing what is best for us better than we do ourselves.</p>
<p>The three parts of an effective prayer can be easily remembered with the ABC acronym: ask (A), believe (B), and claim (C). Author Glen Coon expounds on these in greater detail in his book, <em>The ABCs of Bible Prayer</em>.</p>

<p>In Adam and Eve's rejection of God in the garden, the human race separated itself from its Maker, but He immediately promised them that in His Son, Jesus, He would provide a path to reconciliation for anyone who wanted it (<a href="https://bible-api.com/Genesis%203%3A15?translation=kjv" class="verse-link" data-reference="Genesis 3:15" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Genesis 3:15</a>). This promise was later illustrated to Jacob in the dream of the ladder, symbolizing Jesus, that united heaven and earth (<a href="https://bible-api.com/Genesis%2028%3A12?translation=kjv" class="verse-link" data-reference="Genesis 28:12" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Genesis 28:12</a>).</p>
<p>Adam and Eve's rejection is played out in the life of every person because all have sinned (<a href="https://bible-api.com/Romans%203%3A23?translation=kjv" class="verse-link" data-reference="Romans 3:23" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Romans 3:23</a>), and so apart from Christ—who alone offered His perfect life on the cross to pay for our sins—we have nothing to recommend us to God. Our rejection of Him has rendered us unworthy to even come to Him in prayer, but Jesus turned that completely around! In His name we can "come boldly unto throne of grace, that we may obtain mercy, and find grace to help in time of need" (<a href="https://bible-api.com/Hebrews%204%3A16?translation=kjv" class="verse-link" data-reference="Hebrews 4:16" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hebrews 4:16</a>) because, when we accept Him as our Redeemer and Lord, He covers the shame of our sins with His perfect righteousness (<a href="https://bible-api.com/Isaiah%2061%3A10?translation=kjv" class="verse-link" data-reference="Isaiah 61:10" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Isaiah 61:10</a>), and God calls us His children once more (<a href="https://bible-api.com/1%20John%203%3A1?translation=kjv" class="verse-link" data-reference="1 John 3:1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">1 John 3:1</a>)!

<p>The Bible teaches that every good thing comes from our Father (<a href="https://bible-api.com/James%201%3A17?translation=kjv" class="verse-link" data-reference="James 1:17" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">James 1:17</a>), so praise, gratitude, and thanksgiving have a place in every prayer. There will be circumstances where they may be harder to find, but Paul tells us that "all things work together for good to those who love God" (<a href="https://bible-api.com/Romans%208%3A28?translation=kjv" class="verse-link" data-reference="Romans 8:28" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Romans 8:28</a>). Note that he doesn't say "some things" or "most" but "all." This means that God will use even the greatest tragedy for good—just look at the cross, with Jesus hanging there rejected and crucified by His own people whom He came to save. Nothing we will ever experience comes to close to what He experienced on the cross. He took the sword first and blunted its edge for us.</p>

<p>Prayer leads us into harmony with the mind of Jesus as well as into deeper fellowship with Him. It's said that we are the sum of the people we hang out with because the more time we spend with them the more we imitate them. Prayer, along with Bible study, is how we spend time with Jesus. Bible study is how He talks to us, and prayer is how we talk to Him. In the absence of daily, quality time, every relationship will fall apart, including our relationship with Christ.</p>

<p>When we are tempted, the last thing we want to do is pray, but connecting with God in that crucial time is key, and it's best to continue praying until the temptation passes. As long we hold on to God we cannot be overcome. Praying <em>before</em> the temptation comes, as is demonstrated in Jesus' model prayer for us, is also wise: "and lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil" (<a href="https://bible-api.com/Matthew%206%3A13?translation=kjv" class="verse-link" data-reference="Matthew 6:13" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Matthew 6:13</a>). If we are willing to be vigilant and not put ourselves in situations we know will tempt us, God will do His part to help us. The good news is there is a way of escape out of every temptation as God will never allow us to be temptated beyond what we are able to bear (<a href="https://bible-api.com/1%20Corinthians%2010%3A13?translation=kjv" class="verse-link" data-reference="1 Corinthians 10:13" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">1 Corinthians 10:13</a>).</p>
<p>Had Jesus' disciples heeded His call to watch and pray in Gethsemane, there is no doubt that they would have been strengthened to better endure what was about to come upon Him. And poor Peter—would he have denied His Lord if he had spent that time in prayer instead of sleeping?</p>

<p>And when the dew that lay was gone up, behold, upon the face of the wilderness there lay a small round thing, as small as the hoar frost on the ground. And when the children of Israel saw it, they said one to another, It is manna: for they wist not what it was. And Moses said unto them, This is the bread which the LORD hath given you to eat.

</blockquote><figcaption>— Exodus 16:14-16</figcaption></figure>

<p>When God provided manna for the Israelites, it didn't simply fall into their mouths; they still had to go out and gather it. God wants us to cooperate with Him by investing ourselves in the process; otherwise, we risk becoming lazy with His blessings. The simple truth is that He will never do for us what we can do for ourselves, but once we have done our part, He will do what we <em>cannot</em> do.</p>

<p>The best places for prayer are quiet and free from distractions, allowing us to be fully focused on communing with our heavenly Father. In contrast, the Pharisees of Christ's day loved to pray publicly so they could be seen by others, but Christ wants us to seek Him humbly and in private. Of course, there is a time and place for corporate prayer—such as a church service or a small group—but our personal prayers should be just between us and God.</p>

<p>Jesus associated the repetition of words and phrases with heathenism (<a href="https://bible-api.com/Acts%2019%3A34?translation=kjv" class="verse-link" data-reference="Acts 19:34" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Acts 19:34</a>; <a href="https://bible-api.com/1%20Kings%2018%3A26?translation=kjv" class="verse-link" data-reference="1 Kings 18:26" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">1 Kings 18:26</a>), thereby making it clear that such practices have no place in the life of a Christian. The same is true of breath prayers and the popular practice of "entering the silence," which involves emptying the mind—in reality, turning off the brain—which is one of the quickest ways to enter an altered state of consciousness. All of these paths lead to mysticism and open the door to the influence of malevolent powers. (For more information, see Howard Peth's book, <em>The Dangers of Contemplative Prayer</em>.)</p>
<p>God wants us to be fully engaged when talking to Him, as we would be when talking to a friend, with our minds fully alert and our reasoning powers fully intact (<a href="https://bible-api.com/Isaiah%201%3A18?translation=kjv" class="verse-link" data-reference="Isaiah 1:18" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Isaiah 1:18</a>). Prayer should be fervent, fresh, and from the heart. If our hearts are not in it, we probably shouldn't be praying it. Prayers that mean a lot to us mean a lot to God.</p>

<p>Jesus often prayed aloud, even in His personal prayers; otherwise, they wouldn't have been heard by His disciples and later written down for us.
