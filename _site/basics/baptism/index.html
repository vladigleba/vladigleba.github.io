In fact, the book of Mark makes an inextricable connection between believing in Jesus and being baptized, which shows that baptism is an integral part of the Christian experience.</p></section>

<p>That if thou shalt <em>confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus</em>, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved. For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and <em>with the mouth confession is made unto salvation</em>.</p>

</blockquote><figcaption>— Galatians 3:27</figcaption></figure><p>During His conversation with Nicodemus, Jesus made it clear that baptism is a privilege that all Christians are called to experience. Salvation is a gift from God, received through faith in Jesus Christ (<a href="https://bible-api.com/Ephesians%202%3A8-9?translation=kjv" class="verse-link" data-reference="Ephesians 2:8-9" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ephesians 2:8-9</a>), and this faith is demonstrated through a public, unashamed confession of Him (<a href="https://bible-api.com/Romans%2010%3A9-10?translation=kjv" class="verse-link" data-reference="Romans 10:9-10" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Romans 10:9-10</a>; <a href="https://bible-api.com/Luke%2012%3A8-9?translation=kjv" class="verse-link" data-reference="Luke 12:8-9" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Luke 12:8-9</a>; <a href="https://bible-api.com/2%20Timothy%201%3A12?translation=kjv" class="verse-link" data-reference="2 Timothy 1:12" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2 Timothy 1:12</a>). At baptism, we make an open declaration to all present that we have accepted Him as Lord and Savior, been clothed with the robe of His righteousness (<a href="https://bible-api.com/Galatians%203%3A27?translation=kjv" class="verse-link" data-reference="Galatians 3:27" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Galatians 3:27</a>; <a href="https://bible-api.com/Isaiah%2061%3A10?translation=kjv" class="verse-link" data-reference="Isaiah 61:10" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Isaiah 61:10</a>), and have taken on a new name and identity: follower of Christ, son or daughter of God! By making a public stand for Christ, we also become His witnesses to others, inspiring them to do the same in their own lives.</p></section>

<p>There is one body, and one Spirit, even as ye are called in one hope of your calling; one Lord, one faith, <em>one baptism</em>, one God and Father of all, who is above all, and through all, and in you all.</p>
</blockquote><figcaption>— Ephesians 4:4-6</figcaption></figure><p>The Bible declares that there is only one true baptism, and the word itself offers a clue as to what it involves. The term “baptize” comes from the Greek word <em>baptizō</em>, which means “to immerse,” “to submerge,” or “to dip under.” This might come as a surprise to some, but the Bible never describes baptism using the words “sprinkle” or “pour.” Biblical bapstism is a full immersion in water.</p></section>

<p>Then cometh Jesus from Galilee to Jordan unto John, to be baptized of him. But John forbad him, saying, I have need to be baptized of thee, and comest thou to me? And Jesus answering said unto him, Suffer it to be so now: for thus it becometh us to fulfil all righteousness. Then he suffered him. And <em>Jesus, when he was baptized, went up straightway out of the water</em>: and, lo, the heavens were opened unto him, and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove, and lighting upon him: and lo a voice from heaven, saying, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.</p>
</blockquote><figcaption>— Matthew 3:13-17</figcaption></figure><figure><blockquote>
<p>And it came to pass in those days, that Jesus came from Nazareth of Galilee, and was baptized of John in Jordan. And straightway <em>coming up out of the water</em>, he saw the heavens opened, and the Spirit like a dove descending upon him.</p>
</blockquote><figcaption>— Mark 1:9-10</figcaption></figure><p>John the Baptist chose an area with plenty of water because he practiced the biblical form of baptism—full immersion. Both Matthew and Mark make it clear that this was the type of baptism Jesus received, as they describe Him “coming up out of the water,” indicating that He had first gone down into the water to be baptized.</p></section>

</blockquote><figcaption>— Acts 8:38-39</figcaption></figure><p>The Bible gives the example of Philip and the Ethiopian eunuch to show that Jesus’ disciples did not change the method of baptism after His ascension. Both Philip and the eunuch went down into the water, and after Philip baptized him, they came up out of the water. This mirrors the description and form of baptism that Jesus Himself received.</p></section>

<p><em>Buried with him in baptism</em>, wherein also ye are <em>risen with him through the faith</em> of the operation of God, who hath raised him from the dead.</p>
</blockquote><figcaption>— Colossians 2:12</figcaption></figure><figure><blockquote>
<p>Know ye not, that so many of us as were baptized into Jesus Christ were <em>baptized into his death</em>? Therefore we are <em>buried with him by baptism into death</em>: that like <em>as Christ was raised up from the dead</em> by the glory of the Father, even so <em>we also should walk in newness of life</em>. For if we have been planted together in the <em>likeness of his death</em>, we shall be also in the <em>likeness of his resurrection</em>: Knowing this, that <em>our old man is crucified with him, that the body of sin might be destroyed, that henceforth we should not serve sin</em>.</p>
</blockquote><figcaption>— Romans 6:3-6</figcaption></figure><figure><blockquote>
<p>That <em>ye put off concerning the former conversation the old man</em>, which is corrupt according to the deceitful lusts; and be renewed in the spirit of your mind; and <em>that ye put on the new man</em>, which after God is created in righteousness and true holiness.</p>
</blockquote><figcaption>— Ephesians 4:22-24</figcaption></figure><p>Generally speaking, baptism is a symbol of cleansing from sin, which every person needs, as all have sinned (<a href="https://bible-api.com/Romans%203%3A23?translation=kjv" class="verse-link" data-reference="Romans 3:23" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Romans 3:23</a>). More specifically, it symbolizes the death and burial of the old life of sin and the birth of a new life in Jesus. In other words, it represents Jesus’ death, burial, and resurrection. As we experience His selfless love for us, we are motivated:</p><ol>
<li>to die to sin in our own lives, which involves dying to self,</li>
<li>to bury that old life under the water in baptism, and</li>
<li>to rise to a new life in Jesus by the power of His Holy Spirit.</li>
</ol><p>Baptism is a beautiful and powerful symbol of how Jesus’ death, burial, and resurrection replace our old identity with a completely new one in Him. Using the correct form of baptism matters because any other form undermines the symbolism and meaning of baptism by immersion. Alternative forms portray a vastly different spiritual reality—one that does not reflect the burial of the old life. Biblical baptism illustrates that the Christian life is not merely about becoming a better person; it is about completely crucifying the old self (<a href="https://bible-api.com/Galatians%202%3A20?translation=kjv" class="verse-link" data-reference="Galatians 2:20" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Galatians 2:20</a>; <a href="https://bible-api.com/Galatians%206%3A14?translation=kjv" class="verse-link" data-reference="Galatians 6:14" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">6:14</a>). A failure to fully surrender every area of life to Jesus results in a baptism where the person is, in a sense, “buried alive”—a distortion that robs the believer of the rich blessings Jesus longs to give (<a href="https://bible-api.com/John%2015%3A11?translation=kjv" class="verse-link" data-reference="John 15:11" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">John 15:11</a>).</p></section>

<p>For if we have been planted together in the likeness of his death, we shall be also in the likeness of his resurrection: knowing this, that <em>our old man is crucified with him, that the body of sin might be destroyed, that henceforth we should not serve sin</em>.</p>
</blockquote><figcaption>— Romans 6:5-6</figcaption></figure><p>Baptism to the Christian is what a wedding is to a marriage—a public declaration of commitment. In baptism, however, it is a commitment to Jesus as one’s personal Savior (<a href="https://bible-api.com/Acts%208%3A37?translation=kjv" class="verse-link" data-reference="Acts 8:37" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Acts 8:37</a>),  so it is vital to first get to know Him and understand His teachings. This aligns with the commission Jesus gave His disciples just before His ascension: to share His teachings throughout the world and to baptize those who accept them and believe in Him. Naturally, His teachings will bring conviction of sin, leading the genuine believer to repent of past sins (<a href="https://bible-api.com/Acts%205%3A31?translation=kjv" class="verse-link" data-reference="Acts 5:31" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Acts 5:31</a>) and to choose no longer to serve sin, but to die to self through the power of the Holy Spirit. This experience is known as being born of the Spirit (born again), and when it is present in a believer’s life, that person is ready to make the exciting—yet serious—public commitment to be faithful to Jesus, even to the point of death.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">[1]</a></sup></p><p>Incidentally, this means that infant baptism is not appropriate, because an infant is not mature enough to understand the prerequisites or make the commitment. After all, Jesus Himself was baptized as an adult. Instead of being baptized, infants can be dedicated to God by their parents—as Jesus was (<a href="https://bible-api.com/Luke%202%3A21-39?translation=kjv" class="verse-link" data-reference="Luke 2:21-39" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Luke 2:21-39</a>)—while the parents also dedicate themselves to doing all they can to raise a child who knows and loves God and will one day make that baptismal commitment. The Bible, however, does not specify a particular age for baptism, because every person’s spiritual experience and maturity are different.</p></section>

<p>And one of the malefactors which were hanged railed on him, saying, If thou be Christ, save thyself and us. But the other answering rebuked him, saying, Dost not thou fear God, seeing thou art in the same condemnation? And we indeed justly; for we receive the due reward of our deeds: but this man hath done nothing amiss. And he said unto Jesus, <em>Lord, remember me when thou comest into thy kingdom</em>.</p>
</blockquote><figcaption>— Luke 23:39-42</figcaption></figure><p>The conversion of the thief on the cross demonstrates that there can be unique circumstances which prevent a person from being baptized by immersion. In such cases, the baptism of Jesus is counted on their behalf. However, this is not an excuse for someone who is able but unwilling to be baptized. Baptism remains a vital public commitment to Jesus.</p></section>

<p>For <em>by grace are ye saved through faith</em>; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God:</p>
</blockquote><figcaption>— Ephesians 2:8</figcaption></figure><p>It is important to note that we are not saved by baptism, as salvation is by grace through faith; however, baptism <em>is</em> an act of obedience to Jesus, born out of a conversion marked by genuine love for and gratitude to Him. Baptism does not remove temptation either, but God promises that we will not be tempted beyond what we are able to bear; He will always provide a way of escape (<a href="https://bible-api.com/1%20Corinthians%2010%3A13?translation=kjv" class="verse-link" data-reference="1 Corinthians 10:13" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">1 Corinthians 10:13</a>). Finally, baptism itself does not change the heart—it is a symbol of a heart already transformed by the power of the Holy Spirit.</p></section>

<p><em>Then they that gladly received his word were baptized</em>: and the same day there were added unto them about three thousand souls. And they <em>continued stedfastly in the apostles’ doctrine and fellowship, and in breaking of bread, and in prayers</em>. … And they, <em>continuing daily with one accord in the temple</em>, and breaking bread from house to house, did eat their meat with gladness and singleness of heart, praising God, and having favour with all the people. And <em>the Lord added to the church daily such as should be saved</em>.</p>
</blockquote><figcaption>— Acts 2:41-42, 46-47</figcaption></figure><figure><blockquote>
<p>And <em>He is the head of the body, the church</em>, who is the beginning, the firstborn from the dead, that in all things He may have the preeminence.</p>

<p>For by one Spirit are we all <em>baptized into one body</em>, whether we be Jews or Gentiles, whether we be bond or free; and have been all made to drink into one Spirit.</p>
</blockquote><figcaption>— 1 Corinthians 12:13</figcaption></figure><p>When the disciples began proclaiming the teachings of Jesus, those who believed and were baptized became part of the body of Christ—His church—of which He is Lord. The church is a community of Christ’s followers who nurture one another’s walk with God, work together to serve others, and spread the good news of the gospel. A decision for baptism, therefore, comes with the blessing of fellowship with other believers who accept all of Jesus’ teachings as revealed in the Bible and, by the power of the Holy Spirit, seek to live them out.</p></section>

<p>He said unto them, Have ye received the Holy Ghost since ye believed? And they said unto him, We have not so much as heard whether there be any Holy Ghost. And he said unto them, Unto what then were ye baptized? And they said, Unto John’s baptism. Then said Paul, John verily baptized with the baptism of repentance, saying unto the people, that they should believe on him which should come after him, that is, on Christ Jesus. <em>When they heard this, they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus</em>.</p>
</blockquote><figcaption>— Acts 19:2-5</figcaption></figure><p>Rebaptism may be appropriate when new truth is discovered, as was the case with the group of believers who had been baptized by John but had never heard of the Holy Spirit. After learning this life-changing truth, they were so deeply impacted that they chose to be rebaptized. Another situation in which rebaptism is fitting is when a person desires to return to Jesus after having turned away from Him. Baptism is like a marriage ceremony with Jesus; so if genuine love has been rekindled in the heart—and it is accompanied by a renewed commitment to be faithful through both good times and bad—it can be appropriate to make a new public pledge to Him.</p></section>

<p>Then the <em>eleven disciples</em> went away into Galilee, into a mountain where Jesus had appointed them. And when they saw him, they worshipped him: but some doubted. And Jesus came and spake unto them, saying, All power is given unto me in heaven and in earth. <em>Go ye therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them</em> in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost: teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you: and, lo, I am with you alway, even unto the end of the world.</p>
</blockquote><figcaption>— Matthew 28:16-20</figcaption></figure><p>Jesus gave the authority to baptize exclusively to His disciples, whom He commissioned to faithfully teach all the truths He had commanded them. Therefore, when the Holy Spirit leads someone to seek baptism, it is important to <a href="/prophecy/remnant/">find a church</a> that teaches the full scope of Jesus’ teachings and to request that the church’s ordained male pastor—the modern equivalent of an ordained disciple—perform the baptism. By limiting baptismal authority to ordained pastors, Jesus established a structure designed to uphold the truths He entrusted to His Church and to safeguard her from compromise with error.</p></section>

<p>And as he reasoned of righteousness, temperance, and judgment to come, Felix trembled, and answered, Go thy way for this time; <em>when I have a convenient season, I will call for thee</em>.</p>
</blockquote><figcaption>— Acts 24:25</figcaption></figure><p>When the Holy Spirit brings conviction to the heart, one of Satan’s most effective strategies is to tempt that person to delay their decision until a more convenient time—a time that never comes. Postponing baptism because of a feeling of not being “good enough” is unwise. We begin our Christian walk as spiritual infants, not mature adults, and if babies waited to attempt walking until they were certain they would never fall, they would never learn to walk. So if the Holy Spirit is prompting you to be baptized, the Bible invites you to make plans today—without delay.</p></section>

<li id="fn1" class="footnote-item"><p>Adult baptism, also known as believer’s baptism, was rediscovered by the Anabaptists (“re-baptizers”) during the Protestant Reformation. Prior to the rise of their movement in 1525, infant baptism was the norm across Christendom; the Anabaptists, however, believed that infants are incapable of understanding the gospel or demonstrating the repentance and faith that accompany it. They were ruthlessly persecuted for these beliefs by both Protestants and Catholics alike. For instance, on March 7, 1526, the city council of Zurich—a Protestant stronghold—passed an edict proclaiming the death sentence (by drowning) upon them. Persecution was fierce because baptism was not merely a religious issue but also a civil one. At the heart of the matter was the issue of liberty of conscience—the right to think for oneself—which was a radical idea at the time, threatening the stability of the civil order. Their persecution continued even after the 1648 Peace of Westphalia gave Lutherans and Calvinists official recognition, forcing the Anabaptists to seek reprieve through emigration to America. Today, their descendants include the Mennonites and the Amish, yet we all benefit from the courageous stand they took in offering up their lives for liberty of conscience—especially those living in the United States—because their stand was eventually enshrined in the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. <a href="#fnref1" class="footnote-backref">↩︎</a></p>
